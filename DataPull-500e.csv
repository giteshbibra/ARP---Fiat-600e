Thing that puts me off this, is that Italians ain't the best when it comes to automotive electrics, so I'd be tentative about trusting them to build a electric car that's reliable in the long term. Especially when it's their 1st stab at it... Stellantis has already has already issued recalls for a bunch of its EVs, so as cool as this is - I don't feel like being a guinea pig.

2022-03-03T16:18:21Z,@returner323617,0kDbvxpjLZs,"Despite the occasionally annoying presentation style, it's a reasonable summary.

Reasonable, but not totally accurate.  As a very happy 500e owner, I can offer the following:
*Range - I'm only getting an average of 3.6 miles/kWh - so ~144 miles - and this is always using Range mode for max regen and driving normally on a mix of road types.
*Driving is fun and the car is both nippy and confident (my other car is a BMW i3, and the 500e actually tracks better).
*Interior - I was/am pleasantly impressed with the build quality and most of the materials quality; there's one of one exceptions, but all-in-all it's very good (again, my benchmark is a BMW).
*Practicality - well, it's a Fiat 500 for goodness sake and nobody should be expecting a Tardis.  Having said that, it's more than capable of taking our large weekly shop or carry-on luggage for two.  Again people, it's a city car..!
*Specs - I have the La Prima model, so top-of-the-range.  The specs are pretty amazing, with very driver assistance gizmo you could wish for.  Honestly, the only thing missing is folding door mirrors; but I guess the car is regarded as narrow enough for this to be a moot point.

For me, I believe the 500e delivers much for the price I paid, and the sales numbers reflect that this is a common-enough view.  The level of tech, the impressive build quality, and the sense of style all combine to deliver a valuable package.  A car purchase, any car purchase, is a discretionary spend, so value is totally subjective.",2022-06-14T08:19:07Z

Additionally, many of the legacy manufacturers, when offering an EV version of their compromise vehicle architectures, will spec and price the EV at the highest end of the range; ICE will be available with an entry-level spec/price, but not the EV option.  Fiat, with the 500e, do at least offer all term/spec/price levels, making the EV accessible to a broader customer base.  And that has to be a good thing.",2022-06-14T08:37:36Z

The most basic 500-e is nearly ¬£10k more than the entry petrol version, that's ¬£25k for a very small, basic, low range car, and that climbs to ¬£30k for a higher spec model. THIRTY GRAND! This is why EV's are mostly being bought by the well off at the moment - people who will always have a second ICE car for longer journey's where they're still way more practical.

At this price though, even with a moderate deposit, you're looking at ¬£3-400 per month for a Fiat 500e, which is crazy (Kia EV6, mid-spec on PCP deal is around ¬£7-800pm). This is just totally impractical for most average buyers, especially with many now struggling just to keep the heating on and put food on the table.

The new lights do indeed resemble eye lids and the lack of grille harks back to the original 500 that if I recall correctly had what seemed a spare engine in the boot. An electric door release is form over function for an electric car though draining  a few extra lumps from the battery may not be ideal. I'd hope there is a clear manual release somewhere. After all if your tired and pull over with the heater on and drop off into a deep snooze you'll want to be able to get out when you wake up to.. err.. powder your nose. The 'Sherpa' mode seems to have been around on cars for decades, regularly driving on faster country roads I often find a stream of cars queueing behind a careful driver not that it bothers me that much, honestly it doesn't bother me at all, really I'm REALLY not bothered OK!. I have to agree that 'HORROR' jingle makes me shudder, definitely at night if you live near a certain 24 hour fast food chain. I loved the comment about moaning in the drivers ear how much you hate it in the rear of the car. Now as for sausage dogs (I love em) under breaking they might have a tendency to roll off end end up under the front seats and that Dachshund extraction procedure can be an event in itself. OH and I can't remember if you might have said that you have the older 500 but if it seems like massive difference in nearly all aspects to the review car remember your car has character and you should continue to love it even after a mild moan or tantrum.",2022-02-15T18:37:25Z

2021-06-15T21:51:50Z,@vondahe,pCbZhz5GRmg,"I just drove one today and was disappointed. The infotainment system is terrible (cluttered menu and counter-intuitive) and having buttons to select the gear is an idea you need to have a very peculiar mind to find useful. The indicator arm was mechanical and often remains in the active position after you complete the turn. The navigation was slow and fiddly. 

Unless you‚Äôre a family of midgets or your passengers are pugs, the backseat is only for show. 

It‚Äôs hard to see where the car ends (both ends). The lane assist was worse than driving with an anxious mother-in-law in the backseat. 

The worst thing was the lack of mechanical door opening. To get out of the car, you press a button so make sure you NEVER run the battery to zero or you will need to break a window to escape.

The positives: Good acceleration and nice dashboard. The size is of course convenient but that‚Äôs common for all small cars. Two USB ports but the old USB2 standard instead of USB-C which is the new standard and a proper space for your phone. Good size cup holders and the glove compartment was decent for the car size. The seats were comfortably firm. 

All in all I think this is a car that will appeal much more to women than to men. They may find its quirks more charming than utilitarian men.",2021-06-15T21:54:00Z

At present I am going to have to stick with my little Smart diesel until battery range on vehicles improves and prices become more affordable, admittedly battery ranges are improving, in so many reviews, it's assumed that drivers want range for doing longer journeys, in many cases this is true, but it's also needed for those of us who are unable to have a home chargepoint and where the infrastructure is also very poor, just as a side point, I have written to my local councils and MP on many occasions but have never received a response.

With aircon, infotainment and lights I think the range is more like 150 miles, but I can go a whole week to and from work on one charge. Charging at motorway services can be painfully slow, but if you're passing a Gridserve Electric Highway like the one a Braintree, Essex its soooo fast!! I went from 49% to 85% in 15 minutes. The footwell size is no issue at all, even if I'm wearing big winter boots there's plenty of room. Climate Control is a blessing in winter and very efficient at defrosting. You can pack a huge amount in it, with or without dropping the back seats.
The turning circle it small, and being a small car, you can park in some pretty small spaces.

Honda E gives you much better build quality, more interesting tech, more comfort, cooler retro-futuristic design, interior that gives you a feel of a nice looking living room, lots of huge screens, HDMI-in and much more to enjoy. Range is good enough for its purpose too. 

Honda E makes other people smile when you drives around in town. It's fun and makes everyone happy. Really great car compared to Fiat 500e.",2021-05-29T12:31:59Z

I have another vehicle for road trips and I drive my old Fiat 90% of the time. I would definitely buy another one; it‚Äôs the funnest, fastest, sportiest car I‚Äôve ever driven.

The key to preserving your car is simple: always keep the battery between 20-80%. Don‚Äôt charge to full, never run down to 0%. 

Of course, I charge it to full before a long trip up to the country, and a handful of times I‚Äôve forced it to 0 or even a couple miles past zero. Emergency happen in 9 years of driving. Really, never do that.

You must change the spark plugs at 30K intervals. If not it will make the ignition coils fail eventually and cause a miss fire. 

Have the engine coolant and brake fluid flush. I also recommend having your serpentine belt checked and it might need to be replaced. 

Just recently I have found out the AOS(Air Oil Separator) should be cleaned and gasket replaced along with the PCV valve at 40K. One might not have any problems if pushed but if not taken care of can make one think they have a bad engine with light white smoke at a stop or idle. It literally a $35 fix/maintenance in parts to make sure you 500 keeps running great.

Along with your oil changes, battery replacements and engine air filter changes this should help get you to 200K. I happy to answer any other questions.",2024-01-17T17:33:30Z

2022-12-12T01:40:09Z,@peteinwisconsin2496,CYsKSywBIys,I too want an affordable car.  The problem is that affordable cars don't provide the profit that today's automakers need to survive.  Toyota Motors can no longer survive on the profits delivered by a Tercel or Echo.  Chrysler couldn't survive on the profits from Dodge Omnis.  Today's Stellantis surely can not  do so either.  There won't be a cheap Fiat 500e.  Providing Pete with an affordable car is not a concern to the automakers.  Their job is to make a profit and give that money to the shareholders.  The automakers don't care if Pete or anyone else has to take the bus.,2022-12-12T01:40:09Z

I am 6ft 3 and have tons of room, i have to have my drivers seat as far back as it can go but there is only me in the car so its a non issue. loads of leg and head room. the front of the car is pretty spacious and helps having the big space where the gear stick etc would normally be.

the only thing i have really is the rear view mirror blocks a bit of sight but the icon version does not have seat height adjustment so not sure if that would fix that as the position its in is perfect for everything else, seeing the speedo screen etc.

the previous car was a petrol ds3 crossback lease which had way less room at the front, not much leg room or headroom and also i had to have the seat set at its lowest setting and the steering wheel set to its highest but i still had litterally 1cm gap from the bottom of the steering wheel to the tops of my legs so as you could imagine steering was not that good as my hands kept getting stopped with tops of my legs due to hardly any cap",2022-12-11T14:42:01Z

I am intrigued by this new (forthcoming) Abarth 500 EV provided it offers improvements over the prior ICE cars....For example - Is it quicker?, More torque?, IRS ? improved interior? Front LSD ? and is it affordable?",2022-11-13T00:48:26Z
2023-06-19T21:06:10Z,@alexshepherd,xw4eNfLm0EI,"We‚Äôre replacing our 2014 Abarth 500C Esseesse (160bhp) with a top-spec new FIAT 500e (equivalent of La Prima). Less power and torque (similar to a 1.4 non-turbo 500 Lounge). It‚Äôs going to be about two seconds slower 0-60, top speed some 30mph lower (we never use top speed anyway), but it‚Äôs a whole lot smoother and easier to drive without that awful gearbox. No need for a limited slip diff as it doesn‚Äôt have that surge of turbo power/can‚Äôt spin the wheels!

Driving position is more comfortable (seats are better), it‚Äôs quieter, and ride is smoother with the 400kg extra weight.

Running costs will be a quarter or less - our electricity is cheaper than in Europe or the UK (in NZ we pay the equivalent of 6p/kWh to charge at night when hydro power is plentiful). Our petrol is as expensive as yours.

FIAT have old-technology batteries and motors compared to Tesla, so FIAT‚Äôs EV is relatively slow and not as efficient. My Model 3 Performance has 480bhp vs. the 113bhp of the 500e, yet the efficiency of the larger and heavier Tesla is the same as the 500e. And you can buy a used Model 3 Performance (dual motor AWD) for the same money as a new 500e. Model 3 weighs no more than a similarly-sized petrol BMW 3-series AWD. That‚Äôs probably why it‚Äôs such a great car.

Multilink IRS in the Tesla compared to torsion beam in the 500e means there‚Äôs not really any comparison in how the cars feel - 500e will have that bouncy twitchy handling we know from the Abarth :) Drum rear brakes in the 500e. The Abarth 500e gets rear discs, a bit more power (150bhp) - but costs even more - is it worth it? In the old Abarth 500, compared to the Lounge we had, the difference in suspension tuning was obvious; I‚Äôm not so sure that will be the case with the extra weight of the 500e platform.

The FIAT 500e is also the same price as a brand-new basic Model 3 which still has more than twice the power and 33% more range, so it‚Äôs a no-brainer to pick the Tesla, better fast-charging options too. Reports of trim and build quality concerns are greatly exaggerated‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt think FIAT will sell many 500e here. Basically, it‚Äôs like buying an early Nissan Leaf, but about five times the price and much more exclusive :)",2023-06-19T21:35:54Z

It doesn't have DC fast charging but I don't need it as Level 2 charging can get a full charge in 2 hours. The best feature about this EV is the amazingly small turning circle. This particular 500e was only available in California and Oregon from 2013 to 2018 as a compliance vehicle for Chrysler to sell their ICE vehicles in the US, they actually lost $14,000 selling each EV!

2023-09-22T21:23:17Z,@iareid8255,crllgvMRSaM,"Quentin, 

where did you get the idea that evs are better for the environment than ICEs? Not from Robert Llewelyn, by any chance, because he is totally deluded.
While we have, in the U.K., some renewable generation they do not go to charging electric cars (or heat pumps for that matter). essentially electric cars are powered by gas. It would be better to cut out the middle man and go for propane to power ic engines which would be far more efficient. (There are a large amount of losses between generation and consumer). 
The reason is how our grid works. Nuclear and renewables run at maximum available at all times so cannot respond to the extra load evs put on the grid, this is met by gas which can respond and provide the extra power. The government put the horse before the cart, they should have decarbonised the grid first but that can only be done by nuclear, renewables haven't a hope, they are practically and technically unsuited for large scale grid supply.
Don't take my word for it, an inteligent assessment of this site shows real time grid performance:- https://www.gridwatch.templar.co.uk/.
Note particularly the red and blue in the second column of graphs, red being gas and blue being wind and bear in mind that wind is always at maximum, gas is variable and can rise to meet extra demand.",2023-09-22T21:23:17Z

Ive run a Tesla through work for a few years, and its actually ok, because the network is good and reliable, and doesn't need cards/logins/dongles etc. Its also high output and the software in the car plans the routes of long journeys for you pretty well to keep charging stops brief. The chargers also discourage people from sitting on them which helps with availability. Im sad they didn't keep the 'range extender' type cars going (we have an i3 as the run around) - yes, its a 'hybrid', but its the 'other  way round', ie a serial hybrid,  and as a result, you don't end up using petrol at all often as most journeys are less than 100 miles in reality. Plus, on a long run you can just use fuel for the faster bits, its easy to refill and will run all day if needed. You always have 'full power' as the drive is purely electric (unless you really run the battery low).

The initial cost of the 500 E is too high though, especially considering it‚Äôs limited size as well.

The range isn‚Äôt enough, not even in long range mode.

Little things to note. My 2019 Honda can read texts and allow me to use voice recognition to reply. It‚Äôs a gimmick‚Ä¶used it once. Doesn‚Äôt work with other types of messaging eg What‚Äôs App.
I also have LED dipped headlights, as well as LED running lights & rear lights.
Quite surprised to see that fiat with that price tag only having halogen headlights.
My Auto wipers are (mostly) good, and sensible software means the rear wipe works normally at anytime and will auto wipe on reverse if the front wipers set to auto. Got the sensitivity adjustment as well. Not perfect tho.

Lane departure warning but doesn‚Äôt take control of the steering.
Cruise control.
Manual & automatic speed limiters (speed sign recognition used for automatic).

I‚Äôm torn at the moment, wether next time to go hybrid or jump directly to full electric. Depends on prices, range. Charge times of batteries at that time expect. If no better than now, would prob go hybrid. Next few years critical.
Also there‚Äôs a cut off for new petrol + diesel‚Äôs at the end of this decade‚Ä¶hybrids have an extra 5 years > with this in mind, if we all wait til the last chance saloon, they won‚Äôt be able to make & supply electric vehicles fast enough to meet demand‚Ä¶expect a long wait.

2022-12-02T16:58:35Z,@luckiee_,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,"my issue with electric cars isn't the ""purity"", it's purely environmental. the battery has a lifespan of 100,000 miles tops before needing replacement. the lithium, cobalt and nickel used in the batteries is mined in horrific working conditions, often using child slave labour at gunpoint. the environmental impact of this is huge. while ev lithium ion batteries are supposedly 95% recycleable, less than 5% of ev batteries are actually recycled. the effects of lithium, cobalt, nickel etc when returning to the earth are slightly less horrific than the child slave labour, but still, really bad.

nickel mining alone is eating away at the rainforest, and if the plans to make roads fully electric in the nearish future suceed, it will accelerate this process 10 fold (actually, a lot more than tenfold, but you get the point). they are not sustainable or a long term solution, and rely on third world countries with abhorent working conditions for production. spending 5-10k for a replacement battery, after anywhere between 25-100k miles is financially and enviromentally stupid, considering how many dirty diesels have done 250,000+ miles with basic maintenence. hell most service diesels see 400k - 1,000,000+ with regular maintenence. 

ALSO not to mention that our electricity grid is barely holding up as is and is not nearly renewable enough. it is simply not feasible for mass ownership as of now.

If you want to minimize pollution of cars, which itself is a tiny figure of global pollution (private jets cause more pollution than all of fucking denmark combined for example and thats still a small drop in the ocean), figure out how to lower diesel tailpipe emissions, as the compression ratio's are high enough to run on non fossil fuels.

if you want to do your bit through what you drive - buy a car, any car, new, old, diesel petrol etc and look after it. the consumer throwaway culture is maddening to me personally. petition for the government to auction off the cars held under the 2008 scrappage scheme (even just for parts) which ruined the 2nd hand car market, effecting the poorest the most and generally being a senseless waste of perfectly adequate equipment.

tl;dr - if you want to drive an ev because you enjoy it, no worries, just don't make/be fooled by the pretenses that it has any positive effect whatsoever on the planet.

i'm honestly glad to hear the battery life is better than I had heard; i'm not so much an ev connoseiur so such news is reassuring - i was just using figures i'd found from online sources over the years.

imo its far more of a political issue all around (environment, gov sanctions on petrol/diesel, muh freedoms etc) than a fundamental issue with ev's - they definitely have their pro's and i think a lot of people who live in a city would probably be better off with a small ev (or even a quadrocycle or gwiz or something) for their shop runs instead of a massive crossover.

2022-11-30T13:18:31Z,@jdtseventyfour,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,As always a great honest review and interesting insight into electric car ownership. Thanks Ian and Miss Hubnut!  I like the idea of the 'Onto way' that you can rent the car on a month by month basis. IT gives potential owners the 'try before you buy' option. I'm a bit on the fence with electric cars. I love the clever engineering behind them but am concerned about their end of life recyclability as well as the fact their labelled emission free which they arnt really. One other concern is the battery life. A current petrol or diesel car is designed to have a life of say 10 to 15 years. Most EV's and hybrids seem to have battery issues within 10 years and when the battery needs replacing its a write off due to the fact the battery is basically the floorpan of the car. I have never been in a position to own a new car (i think the newest was 6 years old) due to the cost so if I decided to go electric then I run the risk of a battery towards the end of the cars life. Hopefully I will be proven wrong and future battery's will be more recyclable and last longer. I think electric cars have their place but are not the future. I think Hydrogen powered cars are the future using fuel cell power. ITs an exciting time to be an Automotive engineer that's for sure!!,2022-11-30T13:18:31Z

2022-11-29T11:59:13Z,@Candisa,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,"That Fiat computerised (rear) wiper interval really is a struggle. I have a 2016 Fiat Doblo... It doesn't have auto-wipers, the rear wiper just wipes once every two sweeps of the front wipers. However, if you don't have the front wipers on, it doesn't pick the slowest speed, it wipes as if it was syncing with the front wipers on low continuous speed, which is way too fast for just wiping spray. The interval for both the front and rear wipers is also non-adjustable but speed-dependant, so at higher speeds there's very little difference between interval and low speed while at slower speeds the interval is sometimes too slow but it doesn't rain enough to select low speed continuous.
My previous car (2001 Volvo V70) had adjustable interval (from very very slow to alsmost continuous) on the front wipers and two stages of rear wiper (a nice medium-slow interval and continuous), I liked that a lot better.
Ow, and to top it all off, my Doblo has the same wiper stalk situation as a Multipla: you have to twist the end for the front wipers and a ring for the rear wiper, the stalk itself just moves up for one front wipe, to the dash for rear wash, to the driver for front wash.",2022-11-29T11:59:13Z

I'm actually quite happy watching someone who's opinion I trust doing a review on these things, as it is more or less inevitable that one day we will be forced to use one as a daily and keep the classics for special occasions only.  Also, Wales is more like the terrain I drive on here in NZ, so any results you get are more likely to be closer to what I would get myself.  

So, 140 miles / 230km approx in range....and you have a network that supplies free charging (which will never happen here due to habits of the political nature).  That sounds perfect.....although I would like to see something closer to 400km minimum so I can get to Whitianga and back (320km) without having to stop at the closest top-up point (about 85km short of my destination and a 5km diversion) to top up both on the way there and back.  This might not be possible in a smaller car as yet, but they will get there about the time I want a car that size.

Love the appearance of quality on the interior tactile surfaces and that door ""chonk"" certainly sounds good too.  How do recycled plastic seats feel to sit on?  It will be interesting to see how they last and whether they eventually crumble or melt in the hot summer sun / UV potential....and whether they burn one's thighs in summer like the old vinyl seats do!

2022-11-29T14:14:15Z,@OdykKayne,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,"@@HubNut That it does, yes! Though I think it's just as pointless on those cars as well. If you have a mechanical release that's known to be very reliable, generally, and does the exact same function, why would anyone need to add electronic releases in the first place? :(

I find a lot of things like that with modern cars... I'm not against modern cars, but there's this trend to add things that aren't really necessary in my eyes. Backup cameras, for example....

I understand how they're useful on large commercial vehicles like trucks or vans, or big SUVs... But here in North America, they've been mandated on every vehicle. Why does something like a small  crossover or hatchback need a backup camera? It's not large, so should be fairly easy to park using the rear view mirror or side mirrors... In places like here in Canada, where poor winter weather means that cameras are just going to get covered with slush and snow and ice as you're driving, or salt spray that's kicked up from behind the car on wet Winter roads... The camera lens is going to get all dirty and blurry and useless anyway, but a plain old rear view mirror inside that has done its job perfectly acceptably for decades is not :(

Let alone the repair cost... If your rear view mirror breaks, you just glue another one to your windshield. If you're backup camera breaks, it's likely hundreds and hundreds of dollars to repair (at least here in Canada).

LED headlight assemblies are another example. I'm not against LEDs as they provide superior light, put modern cars have the LEDs embedded in the assembly, meaning if one of the LEDs Burns out, you have to spend potentially hundreds or even thousands on expensive cars to replace the entire assembly for one burnt out LED. Why not design the housings to have replaceable LED bulbs that use the same standard sockets and contacts that we've had for decades? Rather than spending thousands to replace the entire assembly, you could just swap the bulb out as we've done, but still have the benefit of LEDs?

Sorry for the mini rant, haha! Just some observations I've had :)",2022-11-29T14:16:57Z

I am also impressed how you've managed to spawn your own police force of contributors who launch pre-emptive strikes against anyone who is going to say anything negative about EVs. Just to annoy (goad?) that crew I'll say this, in the spirit of summing up what I think: EVs are great as a concept and in practice for many motorists. They are likely to be the way to get about independently in the future. In reality, it's another step in the direction of cars becoming sterile containers. Charging is not great on the public network, and is now the equivalent of ¬£1.30 a litre on my local council network. So they are not going to be marketed as cheap to either buy, or even to run. The idea of considering how to dress while in the car because you don't want to put the heating on is frankly bonkers. I regard wearing a coat and thick socks while driving as a bit odd. If they charged much more quickly (10 mins from min to max), and there were a lot more charge points, I don't think there would be anywhere near as much negativity. It's the future, and will be the way to get about, but an EV is not something we will be likely to take out for a run to soak up the atmosphere. I think that's what upsets some, it's the end of motoring as a fun thing with character.",2022-11-28T19:10:34Z

People are always thinking they need 600 miles because that's what they get out of a tank of diesel, but that's like wearing a waterproof goose down parka in May through July because you were cold and wet for 3 days in January.

You just adjust your thinking, the charging time is a negative, but there are positives to make up for it. 

You shouldn't be doing over 200 miles without a rest anyway really, so as long as there are enough chargers about for people to use, taking a 15-40 minute break every 3 and a bit hours might make the roads safer. Highway code says 15 minutes every 2 hours of driving, the furthest you could go in 2 hours is about 130 ish miles, so well under an EVs range",2022-11-29T03:29:43Z
2022-11-29T07:26:39Z,@chrisyoung7157,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,@@leatherworkstation Agreed. EV's are probably fine most of the time (apart from the cost). It's the other 10% that is the problem. If there was no push to get rid of ICE vehicles but to co-exist there wouldn't be such a back lash. I'm sure most people would be happy to use an EV if affordable most of the time but if you want to tow something occasionally and for a myriad of other reasons occasionally use an ICE vehicle it shouldn't be a mortal sin. If it is I suggest we give up jet travel and use electric trains and clipper ships.,2022-11-29T07:32:39Z

2022-11-29T12:18:25Z,@leatherworkstation,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,"@Dave Marshall¬† that's on them though isn't it. No-one has ever said that ICE cars in general are going away in 2030, of course they aren't, they're just not making new ones.

If you cant afford a new electric car, you can't afford a new petrol car, they're not that far apart, and its in the news currently that by 2025 EVs are expected to be cheaper to purchase than an ICE.

If you don't like electric cars, you don't like new cars most likely, so what does it matter if they stop making new ICE ones? You're not going to get one anyway because apart from the engine, all modern cars have the same issues that subscribers to this channel don't like.

Also all my life people have being telling me that we're eventually going to run out of oil, it hasn't happened yet, and may not happen ever, but that has been a constant background throughout my life.

A lot of your post about values etc seems to be based on the incorrect belief that batteries in EVs fail quickly. They don't, first gen Nissan Leafs are still driving about on their OG battery and they didn't even have active cooling to protect the battery. Modern battery management looks after them much better and they'll last for donkeys years. Definitely well over 100k miles, there are Teslas over 300,000miles, and Nissan say their batteries will last 500k before failing. And any battery issues aren't normally total replacement jobs, the batteries are made up of individual cells, so you can replace the ones that are reporting issues for much less.

By 100k miles plus/10-15 years in, what value are you expecting to have in the car?

You've misunderstood my battery chemistry point though, it's not just about making the batteries go further, that's not the drive for chemistry changes, its material and weight. 

New chemistries have already significantly reduced cobalt usage, there are lithium free batteries being made that are comparable to Lithium ones for static usage, which can bring down overall lithium usage should EVs not move away from it. 

And really it's new technology, we're living through it. In the 90s any rechargeable battery was NiCad, no-one thought anything of it, it was just what you got if you wanted a rechargeable anything. And then they just got replaced by something better, that might happen with Li-ion but we can't see into the future.

As long as mass transport gets cleaner, I hope we can justify keeping and running classics. Of course, a Mitsubishi Evo (just as an extreme example to make a point) is a future classic! Perhaps biofuels can make these oldies even more guilt free. I have heard that companies (Porsche for one) are working on synthetic fuels, so there may be other options.

On the app, YT was simply unwatchable - and with what I reckon will be the ever-upward trajectory of Jonny‚Äôs show, it will only get worse. 
(If my understanding is correct however, it‚Äôs important to realise that the number and frequency of adverts is nothing to do with the particular channel you‚Äôre viewing. ie. not Jonny‚Äôs fault or within his control.)",2023-11-16T08:36:24Z

Enough range to do what I want and with a CCS can charge it back up quickly.  Is the hardtop a hatchback?  One thing about the iMiev it holds a lot when the rear seats are folded flat.  Looks like a fun 2 person car.,2021-07-12T21:18:03Z
2021-07-12T20:01:10Z,@jamesmedard9989,JSwvQE0tgyM,"Thanks for this great review I live in the U.S. and Fiat pulled out of the states so sad :-( I had leased the 500e in 2017 and enjoyed it immensely, but I guess american's love of big cars doomed the previous 500e version, especially with its 90 mile range. So I ended up with a 2020 Hyundai Ioniq Limited, don't get me wrong its super nice and detailed as the Limited is the top trim of the all electric version, but its really more car than I need, I am a single senior that's retired but wanting to stay Green and have another electric car. Fiat pulled out of the U.S. market as sales fell, partly because of the range issue but also because Fiat never did any changes or upgrades to its model 500e in all the years it was in the United States. Fiat should have introduced this newer version and gave it a chance in the U.S. market before pulling out totally. This review shows all the new design features inside and out, plus the top models increased range which is superior to my top trim Hyundai Ioniq model with some similar features equal to my Ioniq. The United States need a small car that is an EV for upper lower income and for lower middle income earners and for students, young families and 55+ seniors, who really aren't looking for 200+ mile range and costing 40K and up. That said Fiat has designed this great model but as in the U.S.'s past can't just sit back and wait for its sales to drop off before making design or feature changes. Fiat needs to stay current with other EV's in the EV market. Jim San Diego, CA",2021-07-12T20:01:10Z

Is it a performer? Is it reliable? Hello! It's a Fiat, so, kind of. But, that's not the point - if it were about all about that we'd all be on BMW or Ducati motorcycles with slicks, suited up with steel pads covering our knees. At a certain point in life you just want a fun ride that everyone else respects as an adult's vehicle and the 500 is exactly that. I think they'll be well received.

The tech is quite good, I didn‚Äôt expect that honestly. The screen feels little weird is it‚Äôs not pointing towards toe driver. The powertrain feels strong and makes the car move with quite some punch around town. It makes interesting EV noises which I like a lot and add the to driving experience in my opinion. 
The normal driving mode is well calibrated and feels like a nice automatic car without applying a lot of regen braking. In the other two ¬´¬†range friendly¬†¬ª modes the regen braking is pretty aggressive and need some getting used to.
The ride quality isn‚Äôt the best ok earth but I was expecting way worse form a SWB ¬´¬†affordable¬†¬ª car. It‚Äôs not soft but the suspension did absorb bumps and road imperfections pretty nicely.

The build quality is somewhat inconsistent around the car. Some party feel well made and high quality and others seem to have been but together by a blind person in the dark‚Ä¶ for example the stitching is so bad that you don‚Äôt have to look at is the figure that out, it felt cheap. But it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt really matter in my opinion.

The radar cruise control does a fantastic job too and it‚Äôs very easy to operate üëå

2020-12-04T20:02:23Z,@brunosmith6925,JSwvQE0tgyM,"@@neutronalchemist3241 You have been drawn in by the hype. Don't for one minute think that Fiat is making EV's because they WANT to make EV's. They (like all legacy automakers) would FAR, FAR prefer to NOT make Ev's at all - ever.
These companies have been dragged kicking and screaming and crying howls of protest into the EV arena, because of three main reasons:
1. Civilised countries are going to BAN the sale of new ICE vehicles within the next 10 years,
2. ICE cars are increasingly penalised with emissions fines, which is starting to really hurt them.
3. The public is finding EV's more economically attractive (total cost of ownership, not sticker price) and in addition, are seeing cars like Tesla as VERY desirable. (Tesla was the ONLY car maker to make good profist during the covid pandemic. EVERY OTHER CAR MAKER suffered big losses.
Fiat is making this piece of rubbish ONLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO CHOICE... not becuase they want to.",2020-12-04T20:03:15Z

They just don't sell well here.  The main Fiat dealership in St. Louis Park, MN still has brand new Fiat 500's still  in stock on the lot from the past few years for sale.
 As for EV's in this area,  there are more Nissan Leafs , Tesla Model S's & Model 3's being sold  here everyday. Tesla opened a dealership here in Eden Prairie, MN a few years back.
  I do have a great childhood memory of my dad bringing home two used Fiats during the  Summer of '84.  He worked as a used car salesman than. In 1984 he  successively brought home a cherry red 1979 Fiat Spyder 2000 & a dark burgundy 1982 Fiat X1/9 off of his dealership lot to tool around in. He ended up selling the X1/9 to a neighbor across the street. Our neighbor kept the X1/9 for a number of years until he traded it for a Porche 928S.",2020-12-03T14:25:52Z

Had to stop watching the Fully Charged Show because Kryton got on my tits with his relentless evangelising about all things electric so no idea if Mr Smith still appears there, he was the only reason I kept with it so long as I bought that EV brainwashing completely until I explored for,myself and discovered the huge inconvenience and extra costs that were glossed over..

As far as range, let's see some realistic actual mileage quoted as well as the meaningless claims. Got to,say though that then500 is a masterpiece of great design in all iterations, maybe a 400 mile Abarth fire-breathing version might sway me but if I had to go for a small EV, the Honda E or Renault Zoe would be one of only three I'd look at but realistically I'll stick my 12 year old German Planet Burner.

Then you're a fool if you don't own one, mate! You know what people don't talk about very much? The actual range of ICE cars. I mean: in a review of a new ICE car, some mention of the range for that particular car. It's very rare. You know why? BECAUSE RANGE DOESN'T REALLY MATTER SO MUCH. This Clean Technica article from 2016 said the median range for ICE was 412 miles. 50% of ICE vehicles in 2016 got less than 412 miles on a tank. Remember back in 2016, when everyone was complaining about ICE range? Me neither! Why did I link an article from way back in 2016? Because I couldn't find a more recent article on the subject of ICE range. I just know that some ICE muscle cars, you know, the ones competing for market share with Model 3's and Taycans and Lucid Air's, have ranges under 200 miles! Let's range-shame THEM! Range anxiety? To me, it's range insanity.

It was a really fun little car, and with some creative packing, could fit my entire drum set in the back, leaving the passenger seat open. I wish they added DC charging and more range over the years, but they didn't seem interested. Ended up replacing it with an i3, and then a Model 3 after that.

What I was wondering about ... what does this car sound like if you're outside of it? Let's say if you're a pedestrian and this car is zooming by, what do you hear? Only the tires? Or more? Don't know how you would objectively need to measure it, but I'd be curious to know (not just for this car, but for every EV you'll test). If in the future all cars are electric the roads will probably be quiet, and because of that - dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists! (Oh, and what does it sound like when you're inside the car?)

It takes all of about 3 minutes to get used to this, and it's ime, totally intuitive. Press more to go faster, lift more to slow down, stay the same to go the same speed.. Simple, easy, intuitive.

2020-12-02T16:48:25Z,@kevinfleming9919,JSwvQE0tgyM,"Another nice Vlog with great camera work, imagery, and sound/musicüëç! Love your honest reviews pointing out all the good and bad, and even what other cars are better choices, have better options, and prices! Love the looks of the 500e and the slightly larger dimensions and wheels (actually not a bad look for you as well with your outfit). Cool little touch with the way they integrated the ""e"" inside the 0 of the 500. Nice interior, the center display didn't look like some slapped on iPad like some other vehicles, and the built in wireless phone chargers are nice. Sounded like it had a really nice quite interior, good soundproofing, and the motor didn't sound whiny or droning inside the cab while you were talking or as it was driving by on the exterior shots. Only 4 things I could pick out that i didn't like were, 1: The musical start/stop is a cute touch that could be fun to show off, but I imagine after hearing it dozens and dozens of times it could get annoying. 2: I wish the roof would tuck down further for better rear visibility. 3: Don't like the location of the switches in the center console because they seem like they could be accidentally hit easily. 4: Really don't like the electric door releases. If you have an electrical problem, how do you open the door? Break a window to get out? I prefer a hard connection with a normal cable latch, because even if the handle or cable broke both doors wouldn't be broken at the same time, the way electrically operated doors could be, and you could climb across to use the other door. When every single thing is electrically operated on an electric car it starts to seem gimmicky and unnecessary, and just an extra power drain on the battery (even if it's just a tiny fraction of power that it uses). Ditch power door handles, get rid of touch screen digital controls for the radio (leave the connections on the steering wheel for safety, not having to move your hands and eyes), leave the climate controls as dials and switches or levers, and no power operated steering column adjustments that add heavy motors. That all being said it's still a really nice car that I would buy....but probably look for someone to modify the doors to some standard Fiat door handles!",2020-12-02T16:48:25Z

I don't really understand what has happened to small EVs over the last few years though. The new ones (MINI, Honda, FIAT, even the Peugeot/Vauxhall) offer numbers similar to a Zoe from 3 years ago (OK, with a little faster charging), but for significantly more money. They seem to be trying to justify that with styling and tech, but it feels like it's back to front - make a really good platform (e-Panda?) and then put the premium styled/featured car at the top of the range for those who care about that sort of thing. The Zoe is a 10 year old design, and thanks to the battery and tech upgrades (and CCS), it's still the best everyday car.",2020-12-02T12:35:15Z

Car should cost ¬£11 000 + battery price - gove grant = ¬£12 500

When are we going to start calling out this inflating of prices.

Yes I know it's higher trim than the ¬£11 000 petrol version but it doesn't matter when there is no low EV trims available. I know R&D cost but car relies on already establish platforms also petrol cars also have R&D cost.

This car should be no more than ¬£14 000 after grants

Unlike these other companies that are bringing out small cars in 2020 that have a claimed range of 100 which in real life is about 70-80..that's not acceptable imo and limits the overall amount of people that will actually buy one.

A properly usable EV for ¬£20k (with more range than the ¬£30k Leaf of 5 years ago)? And nearly 200 miles with 85kW charging for ¬£23.5k?? That's at the low end of Golf pricing, and gives some minigun-level ammunition against the gripe that EVs are too expensive.

Particularly surprising that this is coming from Fiat. They don't have much pedigree with EVs; if I remember rightly the original 500e compliance car had the powertrain design and engineering done by a third party. It's also the company formerly headed by famously anti-EV Sergio Marchionne, who once requested that customers not buy the original 500e.

However, so far I have not seen another electric car that removes that air of an electric vehicle lacking in grace and style, as if it had been made by a computer manufacturer. The only FIAT 500 rival that strays from that concept of hardware on wheels is the Mini ... but the Mini lacks the flair of Italian designers, renowned throughout the world.
We are talking about a beautiful design, reminiscent of its past (something that Mini lost), but according to what is required from now on.

But what I miss and is a bit unfair imo is ppl never show the time they spent charging the thing and never seem to mention how these cars will depreciate in value when a better battery/quicker charging/much longer range EVs inevitably come to market. I guess I'd rather celebrate tech that's mature and exciting. That's just me though.

On the app, YT was simply unwatchable - and with what I reckon will be the ever-upward trajectory of Jonny‚Äôs show, it will only get worse. 
(If my understanding is correct however, it‚Äôs important to realise that the number and frequency of adverts is nothing to do with the particular channel you‚Äôre viewing. ie. not Jonny‚Äôs fault or within his control.)",2023-11-16T08:36:24Z

A well maintained 8 year old car can easily outlive a 2 year old car.
On the other hand a new Fiat 500-e will outlive both by at least a decade as long as Fiat didn't allow themselves a big blunder or you crash it.
The point is, newer cars always cost more than older used ones as long as you are in the regular car marked.
What you choose, depends on what you want, some wnat up to date technology and the feel that a car is ""their car"" so they pay the new price tag, others don't care for that and are well off with used cars.

I personally would always prefer the luxury of an electric drive train over a unreliable and problemativ gas drive train, so for me a 2 year Old BMW 1 series won't be the better deal.

That doesn't say anything about the two cars.

Also a new BMW 1 Series costs around 35.000‚Ç¨ where I live and the Fiat 500 36.000‚Ç¨ without subsidy so the Fiat 500 is definitely not that expensive.",2020-12-08T17:24:02Z

You know that this are just empty words right?
What is value for you?
And what price tag maches what quality level?
And BMW is not exactly know for building exceptional reliable cars.
I would definetly argue that quality/price wise you would be better of with a Vauxall (or Opel) Astra than a BMW 1, since the quality advantage of BMW vs. the Astras is marginal at best and definitely not two times as high.

Also we do not know how well Fiat build that 500, given the high reliability of electric drive trains it isn't a long shot to assume that the Fiat might actually be able to outlive two BMW 1 series for an over all price tag that is lower than one.",2020-12-08T17:31:23Z

Why do you assume that the gas 500 will last longer?
Or any gas engine for that matter.
Gas engines have usualyl very low life spans with around 200.000km reliable.

And why do you assume that the carbon footprint of manufacturing is high?
Vauxhalls last at least 20 years usually 30 with a bit care that is just as long as BMWs last.

The carbon production per unit the electric is far higher unfortunately. Re the Jensen it only does about 1000 miles per year, although mpg is poor it is still hugely better than electric as the manufacturing footprint is so low as we are almost 50 years in the car in its lifetime has only done 50k miles. If you go like for like you would need to buy 5 electric cars over the same period. It‚Äôs not even close.

2020-12-03T00:12:53Z,@kidoctane,JSwvQE0tgyM,"@@mylesclark1757 Hum - the Abarth 500/595/695 is a somewhat of a mainstream version - there have been some limited edition versions (like the outrageously priced Biposto).  Although not a huge seller its been a consistent seller for over 10 years.  

My point is that while the 500e is  undoubtedly pricey now there are ppl who will pay that sort of money for an interesting small car.  It is early days for the EV market so all EV cars are pricey - the 500e seems competitively priced against its opposition.  I expect that over time that EV car prices will reduce as numbers increase and they become more mainstream

There are presently only 3 countries able to mine the metals for batteries and if a country the size of Wales decided tomorrow that only battery cars were to be used (3 million people) one of those countries producing these metals would dry up completely.
The other aspect from an environmental perspective is where do these batteries go at end of life?
In the UK Ineos is already producing 350 thousand tonnes of hydrogen a year and have signed a deal with Kia to get things moving.
We then come on to charging electric cars, how can people in terrace houses charge them, do we leave cables running over pavements (sidewalks) for people to trip over?
We already have a ready made infrastructure for dispensing hydrogen, they are called petrol stations (gas stations).
Safety is no less than that of battery cars, the car Richard Hammond crashed (Rimac) took three days to extinguish the fire due to all the cells combusting in a chain reaction.
Then we come into the shipping of the metals from various countries to China..... Heavy fuel oil, at least in Europe we have MGO (Marine Gas Oil) which a more highly refined fuel emitting less fumes. China are not yet interested in lowering emissions.
Oh and by the way, the UK national grid (electricity) is already running at 95% capacity.
The only reason this is all going ahead is due to government, the same was true of diesel engines and look where that got us, solved the o zone but gave more people is cities breathing problems.... Now they are taxing us out of diesel into another white elephant.",2020-12-02T09:58:33Z

If you are paying such a heavy bag of cash and don't get the range, space, and other basics, then I think it's exploitation in the name of ""E CARS"". Actually, almost all the car makers are doing that these days. How do you save, when you are paying huge cash upfront and lose the peace of mind that you get with ICEs? Good city cars in my opinion were Nissan Micra and Suzuki Alto in the late 90s and 2000s.",2021-06-02T23:23:16Z

This is what Driver's Ed says.

""The cover braking technique involves taking your right foot off the accelerator and holding it over the brake pedal. If you have to stop quickly, your foot is already above the brake pedal and is in the perfect position to press the brake. This method will improve your reaction time. So, whenever you identify a hazard, cover the brake to prepare for sudden stops or slowing. When covering the brake, be careful not to rest your foot on the brake pedal (also known as riding the brake). Riding the brake is not recommended; it will only confuse other drivers and add unnecessary wear to the brakes.""

If we are using regen on the brake pedal, you're driving along and you life off to apply the brakes, you get nothing until the brake is fully applyed passed the point of regen.

When those people drive ice cars, they usually have lower tech and must therefore pay attention. But once they're put into a high tech ekectric car that does all the paying attention for them, they slack off and let the car do the work.

As someone who also drives ev's, i still don't see this as an issue because anything other than something apearing right in front of you out of nowhere, would make the difference and the moment you fully lift off, its already applying max regen belts you apply friction brakes. 

So it really doesn't seem like that big of a deal. The problem is the drivers drivibg ev's, not ev's themselves.

On my Model S it is on screen in a menu and on my VW, it is on the gear selector. My previous Fiat had blended brakes with minimal regen outside of pressing the brake. Both the Fiat and VW do not have the ability to turn off creep that mimics a gas cars inability to stop moving in gear, so the braking also mimics a gas car. Tesla lets you turn off creep mode because an electric car is not a gas car. 
I see a lot of accidents in beep and creep, but in a Tesla with autopilot the car will radar lock on the car in front and accelerate and decelerate to maintain the distance pretty reliably. The important thing is to continue looking out the front window and keeping hands on the wheel and feet near the pedals and not watching a movie or playing video games instead. I have seen people doing the most completely stupid things in cars in traffic since the 1980‚Äôs long before there were EV‚Äôs. 
I submit that many accidents in EV‚Äôs are caused because they have a 500 horsepower vehicle that accelerates very quickly and are not used to it. That‚Äôs also why tires get used so quickly. My Tesla needed new tires at 60,0000 miles and again 57,000 miles later.

I like them a ton because they're just so weird and quirky, but they do it in a way that is stylish. I really want to continue owning a fiat, even just as a secondary fun car, but I feel like they really need to commit and find a niche to fill. Right now, the entry level sub compact ev market is up for the taking, it's insane they don't capitalize on it.
like legitimately, 52,000 for ANY car that offers this range, and level of materials, etc, is going to flop regardless of brand or design. The chevy bolt here in the u.s has 270 MILES OF RANGE, at 27,000$. There is no way they are going to compete with that, paying almost 200% more you still receive plastic molded interior, less range, and essentially just a different design language.

I think Stellantis (and many Legacy automakers) have deliberately overpriced their EVs because they want to keep sales low and high profit as they (certainly their CEO at least) are clearly anti-EV and are intent on slowing down the transition away from ICE cars as long as possible. It simply cannot cost anywhere near the asking price to make a small 2 door car with a 37kWh battery and 87kW motor. This strategy will ultimately backfire IMO.,2023-11-06T01:29:51Z

If you would drive in France, a RAV4 or Rogue will feel too clumsy and big for parking spaces and small roads, not to mention underground parking where a RAV4 will curb the wheels and scrape the bumpers on the first go. Anyone who has been to Paris or Rome probably has seen what parking on a small street looks like.
Also a small electric car has smaller car tax and sales tax, which favors smaller economical cars. To me 500e is part of Fiat¬¥s identity, they make those smaller cars because even though it isn¬¥t profitable it marks the identity of the brand.",2024-05-08T09:21:51Z

IF I recall correctly, the 1st generation sold so poorly that Fiat had to severely discount them ($10K?). I have an acquaintance in SoCa who bought one for a commute that fit in its range and it was amazingly cheap to buy and drive back then.

It's not because that's the limit of how much gas it could hold... they could double the tank capacity if they wanted to, it's not like a 30 gallon tank takes up *that* much space even in a compact vehicle. They have that range because that's what people are comfortable with for the kind of car they buy. So the gasoline range of a car could be said to be the ideal range for its segment.
