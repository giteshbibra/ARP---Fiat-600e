2023-09-21,what a great looking car exciting times ahead for jeep no doubt i really like the motors that stellantis seem to be designing peugeot for one have come on leaps and bounds ,Jeep Avenger
2024-02-29,the sentiment is completely the opposite in north america stellantis is doing a lot of things that people are not happy with,Jeep Avenger
2023-09-21,"for a honest review watch matt watsons carwow review  oh wait you cant cause it was mysteriously taken down a mere few hours after it went live i saw it though it wasnt glowing 
tell me is this press review car doing the rounds the same as carwows a few weeks back
 the one that broke down 4 times with brakeelectrical issues each time matt had to sit outside the car for 520 minutes by the roadside till the car reset itself before he could drive it again
having bought a brand new picasso car of the year winner same as this in 2015 and having nothing but issues with it for 7 years straight  usually electricalengine with no customer support whatsoever i wouldnt trust any stellantis junk cars

2023-09-20,wltp range of 250 miles a real world range of just over 200 miles maybe squeeze a few more out of it if you never leave the 30mph around town then take around 20 off those figures for winter driving and you have another ev to avoid,Jeep Avenger
2023-09-20,did it break down 10 times during the review just asking carwow,Jeep Avenger
2023-09-20,they have done an excellent job with the avenger great blend of price design and function  not an easy trick to pull off and i can see this being a very appealing car to a wide range of buyers interesting section about the cool model names as well i have a theory its actually the jeep part that makes them cool though  hillman avenger  sadness and disappointment jeep avenger  coolness and desirability see o,Jeep Avenger

2023-09-22,you are right but rather a peugeot 2008 i think considering the size  and a citroën c3 cactus etc   it basically the same junk in various designs and settings  french cars have always been great designed  nice and comfortable but they have never ever made a car without electricalelectronical faults,Jeep Avenger

2024-01-31,"jeep wave and ducking are for wrangler only
the wrangler 4xe is the womens car of the year not the model of jeep you are reviewing",Jeep Avenger
2024-01-26,these car of the year awards smell to me it sounds like a payola  send our jurists on allexpenses paid jollies and maybe something under the table and in return we award you a title you can use to fool consumers into buying the car the smell for 2023 was especially bad considering the jeep didnt even go into mass production until late 2023 and yet won in january and when it did turn up people agreed it was a nice looking car but unreliable and underwhelming,Jeep Avenger
2024-01-24,010 buddy that has to be a real jeep as in a wrangler not an italian econobox,Jeep Avenger
2024-01-20,ive been waiting 2 years for parts for my 2014 jeep grand cherokee that unlocks the steering wheel so the car can drive jeep cannot provide me the parts they have told me that manufacturing stopped during covid and has never started back up they held 2000 in cash for 15 months until i finally demanded it back as they couldnt get the part a contractor working on my house has a brand new 2023 model thats 6 months old and its been sitting in jeep waiting for parts for 6 weeks whilst he drives a loan car they told him not to put my km on it  the circus around the carwow video and the cover up to hide this should be a warning to anyone considering a car from jeep or the larger stellantis group and any of their brands to avoid all of them you dont need to be a genius to recognise a sinking ship,Jeep Avenger
2024-01-17,so auto trader couldnt find there own favourite bit of road so just copy harrys garage and go on his lazy journalism,Jeep Avenger

2023-11-16,its a peugeot 2008 with different body and trim parts,Jeep Avenger
2023-11-14,many many years ago when i used to drive my old dads reliant robin it was customary that if you saw another reliant that you waved to them to be fair i would say that 85 of drivers did actually wave back i think this is mainly because a lot of three wheeler drivers were actually exmotorcyclist and traditionally most bikes wave at each other even to this day if i am out on the motorbike most other riders will either nod or wave to you,Jeep Avenger
2023-11-07,not trying to offend anyone but honestly havent been able to understand why some ppl love jeep clearly from this video it doesnt look very comfortable for the passengers and mercedes def win the interior awards,Jeep Avenger

2023-10-19,the jeep wave is for actual jeeps like willys cj2 3 5 7 wranglers gladiators  that sort of jeep all other jeeps are basically marketing,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-19,very good review and pretty much the same thoughts about the jeep as i had after driving it twice it is far too expensive for its size top spec should be at least 5000 s cheaper especially  when compared to the chinese opposition top marks though for the italian design and french engine technology i just hope the heat pump works well here in finland at the moment you cant preheat for charging stops something that is urgently needed in an update when driving in minus 20c conditions,Jeep Avenger

its not worth 20 k 
i would say its a box of plastic",Jeep Avenger
2023-10-09,a jeep the worlds best car how many back handers do they give these reviewers this will depreciate like a stone,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-09,the presence of a lot of plastic can be put down to fiat being the owner of them now or stallantis as its now known and unfortunately fiats plastics as we know form the 500 age horribly look up reviews of used 500s and all of the colouring has come off of the limited edition colour parts theyre surface coloured and not colour through so the moment they wear they either show through white or black depending on the base colour of the plastic substrate that will almost certainly happe with that coloured dash panel,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-09,now i can modify my dacia duster into this,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-09,looks like duster,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-08,stellantis really needs to stop naming cars avenger theyve recycled this nameplate so many timesthe only one anybody liked was the original usspec coupe,Jeep Avenger

2023-10-06,the movement of the interior has immediately put me off,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-05,96 seconds to 60 is pretty darn good for an electric jeep i bought a 1972 alfa romeo 2000 gtv veloce with twin camssodium cooled valvesfuel injection and that was the 060 timesand in that day that was one of the fastest small cars availableso the jeep is pretty fast,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-07,because something was fast 50 years ago doesnt mean its fast now  96 is painfully slow and north of 60mph would be horrific,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-09,chrishannibal5309 i feel like my old 2003 tacoma use to to 60 in 7 seconds,Jeep Avenger
2023-11-25,my car dose 0 to 60 in about the same time believe me its pretty slow,Jeep Avenger
2024-01-14,96s for that price tag is slow same price on an ice car would be much better than that,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-05,the reason i like cars like this is because they are higher and when you are in a car thats high you dont feel as much the distance,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-05,it looks like a dacia duster,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-05,jeep and car of the year ,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-04,using the avenger name is like using a retired players number let the dodge avenger rest in peace pieces,Jeep Avenger

2023-10-04,great review this was very helpful and crystal clear explanation,Jeep Avenger

2023-10-03,"you would have to a complete idiot to buy a jeep product in europe i say this as someone who is on their 12th jeep since i have moved back to europe i was completely shocked how badly jeep treats their customers the dealer network is a special kind of hell they do whatever they can to deny warranty claims i had this situation several times on a wrangler with 12k kms on the clock

2023-10-02,i had an original avenger in the 70s that thing went wrong on a regular basis and i think this will do the same jeep and cheap are synonymous for a reason,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-02,electric dull the go green people have no clue how these electrics are stupid i also dont understand why we have a separate world womens panel of reviewers is this a new gender or something they are and can be part of the existing organisations and agencies why there is separate endorsement and patronage most of all the ambitious ones dont fantasize budget or efficient cars anyways even if it is the world car of the year,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-02,didnt know this existed,Jeep Avenger

2023-10-01,every electric car is a shitbox,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-01,jeep wave and duck duck jeep is only done by the jeeple in wranglers and gladiators,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-01,im a fan of this car but the price is ridiculous for a small car with 4 year old electric car tech its going to get destroyed by the volvo ex30 and the fisker pear when they arrive both will be the same money but years ahead in terms of tech and design its a pity stellantis couldve done a dacia and sold off the old tech at a knock down price personally i dont get what the premium price gets you better residuals,Jeep Avenger

2023-09-28,no one has mentioned the fact that it looks to be a compass  in styling and spec  just with a few tweaks,Jeep Avenger
2023-09-28,i like the looks outside and inside though the transmission tunnel and overly narrow middle rear seat make it a 4seater for a couple with young children wonder what the euroncap rating will be will it roll in the offset,Jeep Avenger
2023-09-28,its landrover wave,Jeep Avenger
2023-09-27,fyi uk is situated in europe,Jeep Avenger
2023-09-27,world car doesnt equal best car its meant to have the greatest impact and value for money also untrue that jeep doesnt address urban families the cherokee has done that for decades,Jeep Avenger
2023-09-27,an ev with 150hp sounds fine to me 80hp in an ev of that size sounds absurd,Jeep Avenger
2023-09-26,the new volvo ex30 is a similar starting price is more modern faster safer better equipped charges faster and is just all round better quality struggling to see how the jeep is in any way interesting or competitive let alone car of the year,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-01,i think it won because its a likeable car theres nothing inoffensive about it its practical and well designed impractical flawed or expensive cars win car of the year all of the time sometimes really dull stuff wins i think this is a decent all rounder though the price is pretty steep the ex30 and the fisker pear will blow this out of the water though it has a head start before values go through the floor i guess thats the story with all of the current crop of evs though the tech is moving so fast,Jeep Avenger
2023-09-26,ive only experienced the jeep wave in a wrangler or gladiator not other normal jeeps,Jeep Avenger
2023-09-26,why is this the car of the yearit is just a regular ev car with a disappointing range bad quality interior and overpriced,Jeep Avenger
2023-09-26,"of course not those titles are being bought is a known practice already
theres nothing car of the year about this crossdressing fiat
is a tiny lifted hatchback with a stupid high price
this is not a jeep a fun serious offroader but a vehicle for the metrosexual libertarian minds the poosers 
its a small hatchback sold for the price of a premium sport sedan with double its power and great performance tesla model 3
this crossdressing fiat would be ok if the price were right aka 30000 eur for the top trim based on what it offers",Jeep Avenger
2023-09-26,a pre production model,Jeep Avenger

2023-09-24,the jeep wave is for wranglers atleast in the tj days and before not sure if it still is,Jeep Avenger
2023-09-23,hey rory autotrader the main question is is it better than peugeot e2008 e2008 seems a slightly more premium design better interiors and more practical whats your take,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-20,jeep is a bit softer and has stronger parts used in the suspension at least thats what they told us ,Jeep Avenger
2023-09-23,so if im between this smart 1 and volvo ex30 which one is better,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-01,ive been sitting in a fiat 600e recently  basically a twoseater as opposed to the smart 1 which is more comparable to a vw id3 in terms of interior space the smart is  and i guess the ex30 will be  a pretty decent offering overall,Jeep Avenger

2023-09-22,"this is one of the things that bugs me car of the year awards at the beginningearly part of the year its just a marketing con it makesabsolutely no sense for a cunsumers point of view why not near the end of the year when they have all the new makesmodels even versionslevel of trims and vitally some sense of reliabilty of cars that have been released during the year in question i mean heck if they had awarded this jeep all these awards and then found out that an engine component regularly lunched the motor or another compnent necessitated the mass recall of the car be it safety or whatever a number of months later well certainly an egg on faces moment eh 
you wouldnt give a crap tonne of awards to a movie say before it was released to the audiences would you it could very well flop big style well as is common these days
to me car of the year awards and the magazines that give them are just moronic its all just a scam and nothing more i prefer to read reviews on what has been out at least a year to get the true sense of what cars or whatever i personally am looking to buy to learn and understand what exactly is and isnt a good product with regards to build quality reliability and value

2023-07-27,if you think as an upgrade you have better options because this looks smaller on inside even than ioniq 5 specially for space on rear seats so that say allot if you want decent room for 4 adults in the car and ioniq 5 can be spec with dualmotor like 4x4 awd and still have 340 miles of range between recharges if you plan going offroad just add some offroad wheels and raise the shocks a bit and ioniq will go in plenty offroads places that would put to shame plenty regular small offroad vehicles i have seen plenty owners doing offroad conversions to ioniq 5 a roofrack for extra gear and went offroading,Jeep Avenger

2023-10-27,actually you dont need 1 pedal driving i usually turn off regen and just coast along  and when i need regen i use brake pedal the way tesla cars are tuned for 1 pedal driving simulates the experience of driving a gas powered car it helps when youre coming from gas to evs but in reality evs dont need that its far more efficient to accelerate coast  use regen by pressing brake rather than 1 pedal where i have to hold the pedal just at the right angle to coast,Jeep Avenger

2023-11-22,reliability is key its also relative to other vehicles in the segment right now its not good certainly not good enough at this price point finally where i live stellantis have a habit of not honouring their warranty being taken to court for it losingbeing fined by the regulator dragging their feet on providing remedies to the plaintiff and then telling everyone they are misunderstood its the way people drive their cars not the failed product,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-26,as an american this car is embarrassing obviously its popularity has a lot to do with the usa associated jeep brand they are buying a dream and it will lead to disappointment as it does not live up to the brand there is a real jeep 4xe plug in hybrid that is sometimes electric and a real jeep the car featured here could not be sold in the states due to its lack of capability hopefully you guys will be getting plenty of real ford broncos to feed that americana off road appetite,Jeep Avenger

2023-10-26,"really enjoy all your videos can i make a tiny request it would really help if at the start of your car reviews you tell us quite plainly and promptly 
1 the mkwh 
2 the range and 
3 the price 

this video for example waits to be half way through to casually mention the vehicle is a 40 grand car
im sure i dont speak for a small percentage of your audience when i say these are the most important factors that all else hang on we may well still watch the video who knows we might win the lotto and now all the other stuff is relevant  but id rather know up front that everything you are about to hear only exists in fantasy land because you cant afford it  rather than entertain the idea that the car is attainable only to be shattered after watching or half watching the video 

and as a post script  you get three quarters of the way through to find out its an electric build over an ice car so there is less space  for those of us really looking to try our best to get into electric car ownership we need a slimmed down version of these kinds of reviews so we can save time having watched this video i now know i would never buy this car even if i had the money so in that sense it has served its purpose but i think if id had the relevant info right at the start i could have come to that conclusion within 1 minute instead of 19",Jeep Avenger

2023-10-25,"i have to agree that it is a stand out car it caught my eye as soon as i saw it and i am neither a jeep fan nor an suv fan it is just a characterful and practical car
i agree also with the notion that some car features dont get properly scrutinised before going into production cars have been around long enough to get the basics right and even though new features pop up from time to time  cup holders for example  surely there is no need to reinvent anything just for the sake of it
ive just started a list of things that i like but arent yet universal even though it is a no brainer to have them the drive selector should be as found in the bmw i3 and now in vw ids too no arguments that is just how it should be sunglasses holder still not universal and yet so useful a glove box that you might be able to fit more than a pair of gloves in at least it should have some room left after putting the handbook in there a spare wheel or a space saver at the minimum this should be top of the list dont know why i left it so long front storage even a front wheel drive multi platform car like this should be able to find room for charging cables but more room would be appreciated for emergency items andor muddy boots rear wheel drive not only does it make for a better balanced drive with no real downsides i got through many severe winters with rwd just put a bag of sand in the boot it puts a bit more weight over the drive wheels and could be good for sprinkling on the road too the upsides are many the driving feel and balance already mentioned bigger front storage tighter turning circle less spinning of the front wheels especially in evs and therefore quicker and safer getaways i love the driver display in the vw id3 that moves with the steering wheel  genius real buttons and knobs i know that teslas system works well but that is the exception that proves the rule if your not 110 confident that your software is well designed and responds instantly dont risk ruining your car just fit real buttons and not haptic ones either finally put efficiency higher on the list of development goals too many manufacturers make their cars only as aerodynamic or light as they feel they can get away with it is such a desirable quality to have an efficient car its a marketable feature",Jeep Avenger

2023-10-25,what are you talking about nobody is crazy about the jeep avenger,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-25,you are dead right about the price being the serious problem with this car at a sensible price the stellantis products would be decent evs for many people but who in their right mind would choose them over far higher spec and higher tech offerings from tesla and the chinese brands for the same price i am convinced stellantis is happy to keep their ev sales to a minimum and slow down the transition away from ice vehicles for as long as possible,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-25,stellantis look to be making excellent secondhand evs by which i mean youll be able to pick up a pretty decent ev for peanuts second hand given their apparent depreciation,Jeep Avenger

2023-10-25,this is not a jeep,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-25,perhaps one of the thing that makes chinese electrics are cheaper is that they simply use simple mechanics case in point the wuling air ev drivetrain instead of fancy motor unit with transaxle the air ev just stuck an electric motor on a rear axle combined with the cheaper lithium iron phosphate they can deliver a truly affordable entry level electric car,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-26,it is also cheaper because it hasnt been manufactured to european standards,Jeep Avenger

2023-10-25,stellantis is not bringing this jeep to the usa sadly as it would be an excellent replacement for my wifes jeep liberty which is now approaching 20 years old and never had to be taken to a dealer  but at that price it would be too expensive anyway  at 30k it would sell  at 40k it wont  and the small ev they are proposing to eventually bring here nooks like crap  so gbye jeep,Jeep Avenger

2023-10-24,100 agree with your lane assist rant i drive a 2009 mini cooper which i hope to replace soon with an electric car but im dreading the enforced tyranny of the lane assist system surely euro ncap should rethink its stance when most drivers turn it off every time they get in their car,Jeep Avenger

2023-10-25,whiteevo6 well its not an ice car so no problem with existing ice parts and carwow must have had a car that was not ready to be driven just bad luck all the others have also appreciated the avenger if you dont like it so be it but he was honest in his review thats for sure,Jeep Avenger

as a jeep grand cherokee owner of a 2014 model that needs so much repair its repair costs are more than its second hand value and jeep refuse to admit the cars a lemon id suggest you buy anything other than an jeep regardless of cost the taking down of the video shows they are dishonest

i find it a little concerning you also say the car is being raved about without mentioning the taking down of the carwow video as it was such a huge news ive had a part on order that starts the car so semi critical for 3 years and they cant obtain it good luck buying this car ",Jeep Avenger

2023-10-24,"a little dubious about the assertion that its the batteries that make nonchinese vehicles more expensive

instead i think there are better causes we can identify

1 labor  every other item that is made in china vs any western country is cheaper because of cheap labor 

2 subsidization  the ccp has identified for whatever reason that making evs is good for china and their export market and have adjusted their industrialization accordingly

3 sharing tech across companies  this one i have less evidence of but it seems reasonable that the way chinese businesses operate there is a lot more tech sharing than in western capitalist countries yes chinese companies compete with each other but their intellectual property laws are a lot more lax than in the west as a result western companies have a lot more expenses reinventing the wheel so to speak with ev drivetrains

4 yes the batteries may be less expensive but for a different reason im willing to wager that the materials that make up chinese batteries cost those companies less

5 and then on the fault of the wests side evs are competing more with existing ice sales when a consumer doesnt have an ice vehicle to choose from they are going to get an ev in china while there are plenty of ice vehicles most of their oems are pure ev plays thus they arent comparing the cost of the ev development and sales with ice vehicles western oems are investing in two or more powertrain lines and so they divide up their revenue accordingly this makes ev development appear more costly vs sales",Jeep Avenger

2023-10-24,although a bit technical would appreciate battery chemistry and heat pump info be included in fully charged reviews,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,exactly you are essentially buying a battery when you buy an ev,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,battery chem is a key consideration for ev selection,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-25,ladaussie so youre putting battery chemistry over range being the most important thing when buying an ev,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-25,its nmc and yes respectively,Jeep Avenger

2023-10-25,good note we can add this into the lower third graphics you see going forward,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-25,a key not the key depending on use case i could see it being more important than range but undoubtedly the most important for most people is cost  jvoric,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-26,jvoric yeh range when you do to and from work shop and local locations chemistry more important get home put on charger repeat,Jeep Avenger

2023-11-18,cant help with all their reviews but the avenger does have a heat pump as standard on all variants and the traction pack is nmc lithium nickel manganese cobalt li nimnco 811 lithiumion 17 modules 102 cells thermal runway at 220c10444f,Jeep Avenger
2023-11-18,"jvoric i think if the op is sure the winter range will easily cover his dailyweekly needs then pack chemistry is important eg nmc li nimnco are more energy dense and by this fact have the potential to have a greater range plus due to their valued constituent materials theres a high likelihood of the pack being recycled at its eventual end of life thermal runaway occurs at 220c10444f which can be caused by puncturing the battery their cratingchargedischarge cycle life is 500 to 2000 80 discharges

whereas lfp lithium ironphosphate lifepo4 are heavier than nmc but less energydense and thus have less potential range especially in cold temps than packs with cobalt and due to less valued chemistry lfp packs are less likely to be recycled thermal runway occurs at 270c518f lfp batteries can withstand puncture without going into immediate thermal runaway their cratingchargedischarge cycle life is 2000 to 5000 80 discharges",Jeep Avenger

2023-10-24,"thanks for the fun item
we used to own many jeeps different sizes and forms like landcruiser but also a small fun suzuki lj80 and even several vw 181 
but they never ever looked like some boring suv 
avenger will start at 38500 not impressive at all but expansive
we have good hopes for the citroen ec3 situated in the bclass 
it will cost around 24000 and have a 320km range and 100kw fast charging that is impressive and affordable",Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,small daily runabout with no rear leg room and 220 mile range for 40k but you get a shelf to dump your  in  only 2 moves to switch lane assist off  stellantis are still way off the mark,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,half of the glovebox is taken up by the fuse box on rhd cars so the shelf is a necessity,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,honestly this car should have topped out at around 32k,Jeep Avenger

2023-10-25,zarlanthegreen i have a peugeot e2008 and im 61 and can sit behind the drivers seat alright i would say though my head scrapes the roof in the rear passenger seats i have to lower the drivers seat so i can comfortably drive it,Jeep Avenger

2023-10-24,the reason for cheaper chinese evs is that they are subsidised up the wazoo by the chinese government  the eu is already getting miffed about this  dont expect cheap chinese imports except maybe in the uk for that much longer,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,as soon as you mentioned the price i stopped watching,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,everyone is everyone rather than a few,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,when a 4wd consumes less than a 2wd coz of more regen why would one build a jeep or any other suvish vehicle without 4wd back then we took our 200quattro or s4 offroad despite of a lowered clearance i dont need airbags or assistants but a sliding sunroof and awd are essential,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,just got my avenger last week your review is spot on the good and the bad,Jeep Avenger
2024-02-13,got mine in october and fully agreed  love it so much,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,i had a jeep renegade when we first got an ev and honestly i just want stellantis to go bankrupt their servicedealership system is so toxic in the states at least youve got to think these are the same people who have been flooding the world with mediocre 4door wranglers and haunting us with trashy chargers and challengers for decades,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-29,haunting lol and who is us you mean you,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,pity stellantis will build a electric jeep  then not sell it in the us,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-26,it is also available with a petrol engine which is more affordable,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,fake jeep,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,regarding the talk about the price at the end i would say no thats not the point the point in most companies is to make as much money as possible for their shareholders this means that they will charge whatever they think people will pay for the product while trying to minimize costs,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-26,true so if fully charged really want to see prices come down to real prices their reviews should not rave about cars that are over priced jack seems to be enthusiastic about every ev his clapometer shows full for everything he reviews and by now is not a valuable gauge of anything dont get me wrong i love his enthusiasm but if your fuelelectric gauge always showed full it wouldnt take long before youd start to think you cant really trust that in your decision making for some of us an extra 10 grand is a lot of money just for a shelf to put stuff on  that you would normally put in the glove box out of sight keeping the dash tidy ,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-26,paowens paowens hes enthusiastic about every ev because fully charged is there to promote evs in general and the transition to sustainable energy use its not for critical car reviews and thats fine as long as you know it,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,looks pleasant  inoffensive i can see why people like it ,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,in addition to 1pedal driving  we should also be able to coast when we lift our right foot this is the most efficient  think how we ride a bicycle regen is great  for when we need to slow down but much of the time coasting is better  because you accelerate less and using the moving mass of the vehicle  to move the car forward  is the most efficient way to do that,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,"i havent driven an ev is there not a zone in the middle of the pedals travel at which there is neither power input to the motor not drawn off with regen

i suppose there would need to be a clever clutch to disengage the motor from the drivetrain to allow it to freewheel and then reengage to regen and do it all seamlessly as the pedal moves through its range of motion",Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,all the vw id cars do that in d mode while having the benefit of regen kicking in when the sensorsgps detect cars bends roundabouts etc,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,andrewhelgecox yes but this takes effort and you cant do it as well as just lifting your foot,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,"fusflash1 well  yes and no we have had 2 egolfs and they did this but our id4 only does it on the highway on smaller roads it has variable regen on down slopes and only coasts on level ground which misses much of the point

hyundai and kia evs have coasting modes which is great but they default back to mild regen each time you start the car",Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,neilblanchardwe have a us kona ev and at startup my wife puts it into sport and reduces regen to 0 with the right regen paddle  i drive eco which i have saved to 3  the option is good  and lane keep is off because my wife found it annoying we dont have acc or lane following,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,fusflash1 my 2022 eniro does that to and ive got flappy paddles to make changing the regen easy,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,andrewhelgecoxin our nissan leaf i try to hold the pedal in a coasting position by seeing that the instrument report neither consumption nor regen but its at best a guess difficult to hold and not even at a fixed point in the pedals travel so its a complete pain if you go straight from power to regen you are sacrificing energy to the inefficiency of the motor twice so you do not get back what you used around town one pedal driving is nice and easy but for efficiency what i want is at least the option to coast on lift off but have regeneration triggered by the brake pedal only bringing in the friction brakes when the motor cant slow you fast enough and in contrast to the muttering rotters i would like a nice clear change in pedal feel at that point so that i can learn how much i can slow without bringing the friction brakes in im pretty sure kiahyundai cars can do this without the clear change in pedal feel but i wish reviewers would report on every cars ability to do it its not easy informs to find,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,neilblanchard my id3 behaves most of the time correctly with the eco assist option on regen on down slopes kicks in only if it reaches the speed limit otherwise it coasts well i have to agree that it is not perfect and sometimes it does not know what to do,Jeep Avenger
2024-04-13,"yes i have an mg zs i dont mind working the pedals to work it to coast 
i have found weakest regen setting lets me coast moreso buuut on my testing i get less back than moderating it myself",Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,never an suv never ever maybe a crossover but not likely,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,whilst the jeep is close to 40000 and it sounds like a very large sum for a small car there may be a way to bring that down to a more manageable amount i have a similar citroën ec4 and new it was just over 36000 however  i lease it for just 265mth after placing 1250 as a deposit  it is a totally practical family runabout  maybe in a few months this jeep could be leased for around 300mth please note that my previous petrol bill was 150mth and my electric bill is around 40mth saving 100mth you could argue this off the lease cost so a new jeep for around 200mth cheap efficient  and stylish motoring,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,or a new ec3 for 23k on the road,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-25,rcajavus8141  indeed the ec3 could be a best seller when it comes out in 2024 hopefully it wont be too small,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,regardless of your enthusiasm  from a financial point of view none of this electric car make any sense at all which is why the electric car industry is in the trouble  that it is right now in right now this car is overpriced by at least 20k,Jeep Avenger

2023-10-24,thanks jack sharp indeed,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,my parents bought a suzuki ignis recently its so practical it makes a lot of sense to build a car which is shaped like an suv but the size of a hatchback you get extra room and height but without the footprint,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-25,no you get way more room and height internally if you have an actual hatchback instead of a crossover suvs and crossovers have many drawbacks and zero benefits a hatchback more room even if they are smaller and if it doesnt have enough room get an estatestation wagon all the while being far lighter and easier to get in and out of,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-25,"zarlanthegreen im not sure what youre basing that on im pretty certain the ignis is a lot roomier than hatchbacks with a comparable footprint like the swift or the hyundai i10

when i say height i mean driving position i dont know about the headroom",Jeep Avenger
2023-10-25,"andybrice2711 i checked and the ignis only has four seats unlike the other cars you mention it has a little more space in the boottrunk but not nearly as much as the space in the fifth seat of the other two cars
as for having a higher position
that has no notable actual benefit",Jeep Avenger
2023-10-25,love an ignis me,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-25,"ahh yeah it is a shame they removed the 5 seat option the boot is pretty huge though

i vastly prefer the high driving position firstly the seats are at buttock height so you dont have to climb in and out

secondly im sure its easier to judge distances when youre higher up ive heard people claim that science says otherwise but im entirely unconvinced by their reasoning stereoscopy plus triangulation seems a lot more effective than stereoscopy alone both intuitively and logically",Jeep Avenger
2023-10-26,andybrice2711 it has less space for luggage compared to the hatchbacks you mentioned so youre clearly wrong there and triangulation is obviously used with all vehicles so you have no leg to stand on there and you think you personal 100 subjective and biased experience is better than several independent rigorous investigations of countless carsdrivers that do their best to eliminate bias and confounding variables i dont even need to point out the issue there,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-26,"zarlanthegreen nah i just looked it up the ignis does have a larger boot granted only slightly larger by volume though but i think it is also a lot more cuboidshaped so it can more efficiently hold boxes and cases

it is possible that my sense of better depth perception is all psychological and really its just my dumb monkeybrain feeling _big thing above me  scary small thing below me  fine_

but that doesnt seem to add up to me like obviously whenever anyone wants to position their vehicle accurately they look at the ground to triangulate when youre finely judging the distance to the vehicle in front you look at the back wheels or bumper when youre parking in a tight space you might tilt the mirrors down to see the wheels and bumpers relative to the ground

maybe there are other nuances or factors i havent considered im always up for being convinced by empirical evidence that my perception of the world is completely distorted but so far i havent seen anything with enough rigour to persuade me that triangulating object positions relative to the ground is purely habit and doesnt actually work",Jeep Avenger

2023-10-24,"notes from an avenger owner
333 jeep avenger is either pure petrol or full electric the fiat 600 will have a hybrid variant
654 the reversing camera doesnt have any protections so mud dust or rain will make it sorta useless requiring you to get out and cleandry it
1501 there are no climate control in the back not even a duct from the front so whoever is in the back needs to rely on the front heated seats for comfort in the winter or whatever gust of wind from the main hvac outlets on the dash in the summer

your car seems to be equipped with the optional leather  electric control seats id love to hear feedback on them my first edition couldnt be specced with them and every local dealer wouldnt stock them so it has been a nagging thought since ordering it if they are any good or not",Jeep Avenger

2023-10-24,"but to summarise euro ncap wont give a 5 star rating without lane keep assist or if it can be switched off just by pressing a button i think  and they require that it has to be turned back on every time you restart the car jeep have been clever because the button opens the screen where you can turn it off so 2 presses required and 5 rating preserved 

the nissan ariya has got lka right though you can set your own preference for both sensitivity and intrusiveness on the lowest level of intrusiveness it doesnt yank the wheel at all just makes it vibrate so it wont cause an accident but it might still help prevent one as it is supposed to and the best bit is those settings can be chosen once and theyll be retained unlike turning it off altogether",Jeep Avenger

2023-10-24,i dont understand what youre saying i have a 2019 enirol here in france one of the first to come into the country and i can turn off lca using a button just to the left of the steering wheel the problem is that the button is obscured by the steering wheel cruise control default is off and lca still works when cruise is off,Jeep Avenger

2023-10-24,8antipode9 reallyso you cant turn it off at all i live in rural france which has mostly empty back roads some with white lines down the middle some not if the road has a white line the lca is a pain so i turn it off the button cannot be seen from the driving position but ive had the car nearly 5 years now so i know where to hit it hope yours has been good ours is at 91000 km now55000 milesand its been rock solid so far,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,kiaenirodiariesencore4270 if the cruise control is on then the lane keep is on so technically yes you can turn it off  its a real nuisance when you pass by an off ramp and the car sees that shoulder line running off and the wheel gently jerks to try and send you down the offramp  i spent a while googling to figure out a way to use cruise without lane keep and it does not seem to be possible also where i learned of the button on the eu models  overall though i love my car and would say hands down its the best car ive ever owned,Jeep Avenger

2023-10-24,theres more important points at hand it doesnt matter how efficient or cheap evs become markets are forcing better battery technology to constantly be produced the big energy companies are never going to lose out so the price of electricity will continue to rise until it costs the same or more as running a petrol or diesel your home energy bills will continue to sky rocket and will rise more and more as renewables grow make a program about the problem in hand,Jeep Avenger
2023-10-24,hmmi thought that the prices of electricity are actually going down as more companies move to using renewable options  in any case ive got a solar install on my house so i dont really care that much about what prices the big energy companies want to charge for electricity,Jeep Avenger

2023-10-25,"reliability is not actually reliability it is true that for instance french and italian car brands are not known for reliability but for their cheap price and low upkeep costs
on the other hand german brands are also not known for reliability these are mostly luxury cars requiring high maintenance thus high upkeep costs
japanese car brands are actually known for reliability like cars running 100000 km without maintenance and without anything breaking
but with evs where many mechanical components are gone the reliability is likely to shift a lot 
there are different expectations on what reliability means is the german car reliable because you spend a lot of time and money to ensure that it operates properly or is the japanese definition more to your expectation of reliability where a car just operates properly for a very long time without you having to spend time andor money to make sure it is working properly
it would be easy to say that most people might favor the japanese way but in germany that is not the case japanese cars are almost nonexistent here even though they dominate many other markets this is because there are people who define reliability in the sense of the german car example and they want the luxury these cars promise",Jeep Avenger

2023-11-04,bw1376 i think he talks about jeep before the stellantis era had an older one with a 52 litre v8 very nice car built quality wasnt very good but for me it was reliable and comfortable and it was strong could pull an overloaded trailer out of the forest without problems after stellantis got them i dont know how good they are but with the new engines i wasnt interested to buy one i remember i was to the technical inspection and he looked at the rusty brake line and wasnt sure about it he called for the workmate that had more experience with american cars and asked what he thinks he only said look how thick that brake line is compared to european cars there is enough material no problem i think under stellantis control this brake lines will be thinner,Jeep Avenger

2022-12-01,is it just me or does the avenger look a bit cheap the plastic wheel trims the plasticlooking wing mirrors etc theres a good car in here somewhere but quite a few changes to be made first,Jeep Avenger
2022-12-01,front volkswagen rear peugeot,Jeep Avenger
2022-12-01,man that thing is beautiful,Jeep Avenger
2022-12-01,fwd only is a dealbreaker unfortunately if they ever come up with an awd variant ill be interested again its a shame too this cars size and proportions are just about perfect and it looks amazing too,Jeep Avenger
2022-12-01,why cant the us get this vehicle we never get the awesome tech in vehicles,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-30,i love your reviews its great to see companies really pushing the switch to electric but the last jeep we had was terrible with reliability unfortunately im interested to see how that pans out for them hopefully it gets better keep up the great reviews,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-30,"come on vicky
come down off that fence and tell us all how you really feel about this car  
also whats with the very james bondy backing soundtrack i kept expecting to see machine guns poking out from the 7bar grill or something 
personally im not a fan of suvs as they have been shown to use up around 25 more energy in production and running than a standard hatchback
however having said that i agree the avenger looks a stylish jeep design ",Jeep Avenger
2022-11-30,would have loved to see a deeper dive in media software legacy automakers struggle in making a decent ux with competitive features video notes how it has everything you might want when it doesnt show any competitive features to android automotive or new automakers,Jeep Avenger
2022-12-04,actually this _is_ android automotive jeep uses it as the basis of its incar systems across all its new models this one included i have the same system but in a different car and its fast responsive logically laid out and it supports wireless android and apple phone mirroring in other words everything you might want,Jeep Avenger
2022-12-04,"krisw1 you say that yet it wasnt ever looked at in the video 

does it have play store too so youtube netflix and music streaming can be installed because thats something user might want while charging i know i use them",Jeep Avenger
2022-12-06,"martinzw i do know that jeep adopted android automotive as its incar os across its product range as uconnect version 5x  if this car uses a different os it would be the sole exception from jeeps recent launches

but android automotive is not android as you understand it android automotive is an operating system that is based on android and shares its libraries and services with the android phonetablettv operating system and so it is capable of running android apps but unlike android for phones car systems that use android automotive do not have to include a play store or the standard google app suite as part of the licensing agreement the manufacturer controls what apps are made available on the system not google  if you want to use streaming services in your car the best way is to use the app thats on your android phone displayed the car systems screen using googles android auto technology which is not the same thing at all as android automotive hey dont blame me it wasnt me who chose two nearlyidentical names for two completely different things 

and yes this car supports both android auto and apples equivalent carplay",Jeep Avenger
2022-11-30,wonder what the fiat version will look like,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-30,big question for me would be reliability which jeep doesnt have a great reputation for odd choice of name too for this particular vehicle doesnt suit it imo evenger perhaps,Jeep Avenger
2023-01-16,purely ev you would think reliability should not be as big an issue as their ice models they briefly offered 5 year warranty but back to 3 years standard now i am still waiting for jeep to detail the warranty on the avenger no details given yet,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-29,cant help but notice the lack of passenger grab handles which is a strange omission in a car marketed as having offroad abilities  looks good apart from that  great review as always,Jeep Avenger
2023-01-15,i did spot that as well but at least the front passenger has onestrange and unfortunate omission but same as one usb in backcutting corners for that 36500 price point,Jeep Avenger

2022-11-29,i like it its great for cities and especially in the european market jeep is just trying to get every market they can but with their own twist in your garage you can have a wrangler for the weekend and an avenger for the the week makes sense to me great review by the wag,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-29,she likes it she really likes it good review thanks,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-29,thanks for watching,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-29,sticking to my kona ev not much to get excited about here,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-29,"sobecause you like jeep as a brand this  because it has a jeep badge  its interesting practical and you like it despite the fact that it is only fwd you even dont mind the very light too light steering wheel and  you find its infotainment system ineat and tidy
but if we watch all these things because under the bonnet avenger is basically identical to ec4 e2008 ds 3 etense reviewed in a french version of cmp based b segment ev then they are unworthy and you have a slightly stiff upper lip and raised nose about them ",Jeep Avenger
2022-11-29,great review vicky i love this so cute ,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-29,my wife and i were looking forward to this coming to the us market but sadly they decided against it it wouldve been a nice addition and companion to our jeep renegade that we love  awesome review vicky,Jeep Avenger

2022-11-28,looks like a mean golden retriever puppy  a mini renegade good stuff,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,by the looks of things this is based off the latest adaptation of the ec4mokka2008208corsa platform no complaints here from me if that is the case especially as this system has proven very reliable in the aforementioned cases nice styling and scaling choices here too,Jeep Avenger
2022-12-01,its just a peugeot 2008 with jeep badging,Jeep Avenger
2022-12-01,alfrredd to be fair thats most likely no bad thing whatsoever especially as it means many of the parts shared will be ridiculously cheaper than if they were purpose built for that singular variant,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,is this related to the 2008 and mokka ,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-29,"yep if you disregard the dimensions and styling  practically identical 
the difference is just in tech advancements made since their presentation like 2021 corsa e mokka e ec4 ds 3 cb etense e208 e2008 doesnt have the same energy density battery 50 kwh instead of 54 and some tweaks under the bonnet which all result in a longer range",Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,its all very excitingthat is until they finalise the price it will be extortionate,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,42k for the basic one cmon wake up folks,Jeep Avenger

2022-11-28,nice to see something a bit different  price will of course be key  bet you its nearer 40k by the time it gets here,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,very nice styling,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,vicky has great knowledge and presentation skill interesting offering we have a 3008 hybrid as family 3rd car used for dogs shopping in town due for replacement in august this ticks a lot of boxes ,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,this woman provides good reviews i dont share her enthusiasm for jeeps i prefer more agile vehicles and so would prefer a polo to the avenger but i think this reporter does cover the vehicle well,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,this looks great,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,a lot of jeep pr in this review we dont get any bad points or downsides feels like they want to get invited to the next launch i guess we have to wait for doug demuro for the quirks and features,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-29,i think thats a bit harsh imho vickys videos are always balanced in terms of positives and negatives,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-30,"vincentohanlon i dont think red is right that this is pr  presenter just loved the car but reason why he might believe so could be related to an area important to him that was not reviewed

2022-11-28,vauxhall mokka e underneath  which is a peugeot 2008 e,Jeep Avenger

2022-12-03,larger battery though,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,looks like peugeot 3008 front and citroen back end another stellantis hash up,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,this is far more cohesive and pleasing to the eye than any of the french rivals from the same group perhaps the megane is a better car but thats a class bigger and more expensive the avenger is ahead of the competition,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,i think if they add a center armrest to the back as standard itd be a perfect family car and honestly would tempt me a lot,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,great review vicky ,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,another cracking review vicky  i always enjoy your reviews,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-30,its really great to see diversity in a traditionally mens domain good on you girl your dad would be proud,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,generally i have a huge dislike for anything in the suv class but this really is something different far smaller than many it looks really purposeful and quite squat,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,its a very nice looking car especially at the front with the black headlight area the interior is simple but very spacious good job jeep,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,mmmmm jury is out,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,great little ev,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,i really like the look of this just the right size for city driving too,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,"ill wait for the petrol version if they dont over price it and not many will be able to afford it  
it wont be priced like the captur and juke itll be priced more as a premium version of those rivals

2022-11-28,the first jeep under stellantis platform since the interior looks like a peugeot with infotainment system of a citroen ,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,the software is from the fiat 500e and it has the 500 gear selector buttons,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-29,"oliverstemp9132 no its not this is the latest stellantis infotainment system you can find in peugeot 308 408 citroen c5x etc and the drive mode button is exactly the same as in everything from  corsa 208 trough c4 and astra up to 508 and grandland
though it is absolutely possible that the latest version of 500 has the same infotainment software and drive mode selector but its not from fiat anymore",Jeep Avenger
2022-11-29,mirkozlikovski9553 ive tried out all of those cars this software is clearly different from peugeot and all the others but is the same as the 500 the reason being is this is open source android automotive rather rather than bring proprietary it looks like the android automotive system has been chosen going forward the 500 was developed pre merger and is completely different from the 208 and corsa nothing is shared however it seems like future models will be a best of both hence the gear buttons from the 500,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-29,"oliverstemp9132 funny you say that you drove them all since the new peugeot 408 is just having its first presentation tests and its not on sale yet and c5 x and new 308 are rather rare on roads since they fully went on sale in the beginning of this year 
i saw this infotainment system in person only in the new 2022 c5 x early this may my 2020 p508 sw does not have it and from what i just saw in quick checks of a few new 2022 fiat 500 e videos its system looks similar too so i kind of  doubt premerger versions of 500 have it first stellantis production car that had it was new 308 i think or may be new ds4 not sure which one of them was presented first of course my assumptions are based only by the look of the tilewidget based ui look and swiping animation of what can be seen in this avenger video that looks identical to what i saw this may when i test drove new c5 x
and the drive select mode button is exactly the same as in my p508 sw or 2020 citroen c4 ",Jeep Avenger
2022-11-29,mirkozlikovski9553 it really isnt the same,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-29,oliverstemp9132 well ok i really could not claim for sure since i havent seen this one in avenger by myself neither that in premergerr 500 but i saw the one in new p308 fiddled with one briefly in new astra and played with one in new c4 x and they all looked pretty similar to what can be seen in this video,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-30,mirkozlikovski9553 well you arent as observant as i am then,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-30,"oliverstemp9132 well may be you are  but if you are maybe you can play a bit of the spot the difference
httpsipostimgccxj3qhdwlavengerjpg
httpsipostimgccy9xp4vv9c5xjpg
and tell me if their overall ui as well as the actual tiles for widgets they bot have on screen ventilationclimate control and application drawer are the same or from two completely unrelated systems
or may be the differences in their home screen layouts
httpsipostimgcck5kcn1fhavengerhomescrjpg
httpsipostimgccyyrbsjtqc5xhomescrjpg
because to unobservant me they look pretty much identical if we disregard the color scheme and some minor brand only appearance modifications  ",Jeep Avenger
2022-11-30,mirkozlikovski9553 i love hoe far you are going with this but they are very different,Jeep Avenger
2022-12-01,oliverstemp9132  not really since after my initial post im constantly allowing the option that youre right or better said that they all are based on premerger fiat system and im just stating even with pictures why i think avengers infotainment is the same as in latest models of other stellantis vehicles ,Jeep Avenger
2022-12-01,oliverstemp9132 o btw did you spot the difference and if you did what is it ,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,its just a peugeot e2008 vauxhall mokka e in a jeep with a slightly larger battery but still has very average range,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,its bigger inside than those cars,Jeep Avenger

2022-11-28,id like a hillman avenger,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,i like however the range as with all evs is the killer for me as a rural dweller there is no infrastructure in place government is all yap and no action so its ice for me and millions until ranges improve and government installs adequate infrastructure,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,vicky definitely has the gift of gab,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,250miles so a solid 200 in real life from a 51kw usable battery in a  brick shaped car is good going,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,jeep have done some black magic visual trickery with the avenger vicky keeps saying its tiny but it looks decently sized its unfortunate its fwdonly and not available in north america it probably would need to have 240mi of epa range to be viable in the usa,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,they have an awd model for this model as an ev this would be perfect if it had more range for the us,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-29,yeah i wish they wouldve brought it to the states it would be perfect for my wife who commutes about 3 miles to and from work every day our renegade is fwd and to be honest i was skeptical about it at first but 5 years of solid service and 4 snow storms later i am not talk feet of snow but 2 of them were 9 deep and it did amazingly well havent got it stuck yet now the 2023 renegades are all 4x4 and theyve tamed down the color palate as well but the new dash and infotainment few more payments left then i might go snag a th renegade and have some fun build a small overlanding rig for my wife and i ,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-29,what exactly makes this a jeep just change the fake grill a bit and it could just as easily pass for a kia or toyota or subaru or,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-29,"b9m3 eh youre blind  designwise this is resized compass  unless you find that compass could pass for a kia sportage or subaru crosstrek
it would be far more understandable if youd btch about it being redressed peugeot e2008",Jeep Avenger

2022-11-28,its better to go with japanese cars if you want reliability in this price range but i really do love jeepthey make some good carslove the way the avenger looksbtw the review was spot onthanks again for an amazing video yet againyou guys never fail to hit the sweet spot when it comes to reviewing cars,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,care to name any japanese rivals that are fully electric with chunky off road looks in a compact size,Jeep Avenger

2022-11-28,so what speed does it charge at how long does it take to charge  surely this should be covered in every battery car review and someone should not have to ask in the comments section to try and find out,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-29,"yeah  

ive gotta be honest i wouldve liked to have seen a lot less vicky and a lot more car in this review not just because i didnt see much of the interior but because she makes me feel anxious  there was no smiling joking or any witty comments just non stop talking but in a way that made her come across as she doesnt like her job

i couldnt find matt from carwow anywhere online for a review of this car hes got great charisma",Jeep Avenger
2023-03-05,you can get specifications from the car manufacturers website video reviews are for telling us what its like to drive,Jeep Avenger

2022-11-28,looks great,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,quite a neat looking car better than any vw     id still prefer the 70s hillman version though ,Jeep Avenger
2022-11-28,been waiting for this review really like this car think jeep have got a big seller on their hands i agree to many brands thinking bigger is better and not spending time or money on developing smaller models in their ranges not everyone wants or needs a giant suv that can carry 7 6ft people and drive 500miles at a time another great review vicki ,Jeep Avenger

2024-03-08,does anyone ordered the new long range kona recently is the  218hp electric motor with 654 kwh battery still available i ordered a new kona in romania and only the 204hp and 648kwh configuration is available,Hyundai Kona

2024-01-20,so you didnt actually answer the question in your title thats frustrating is it better than the niro ev or not,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-18,hyundai havent made the traction control better  instead theyve just dropped torque from 395nm to only 255nm,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-18,"i have a 2021 kona electric ultimate to buy it now its almost 4k more and the battery is no better and even then you need to add 3k worth of option packs to get a top spec

2023-12-26,yes the heat pump costs 900 on the niro ev but the price of the top spec niro is about 800 less than the top spec kona so its not so much of a difference,Hyundai Kona
2023-12-23,complaining that the steering wheel blocks the display but cant you just adjust the steering wheels tilt to be able to see the screen better,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-11,yes but the visibility depends on driver height and many people may have no issues,Hyundai Kona
2023-12-08,the interior design looks super nice and clean which is appealing and i think it spent money where you want it spent i dont care if that part of the door panel is cheap im resting my elbow on it  the screen set up looks great clear and easy to use on the move i am amazed some other model systems are even legal eg volvo xc30 where everything is done through a massive touch screen im not allowed to hold my mobile but its perfectly fine for me to play around on that while flying down the motorway for me it would have to be the longer range version but that pushes it into that high tax bracket an additional 390 pa for 5 years is crazy even for evs ive driven a petrol nline and really enjoyed it even that was quiet so i expect to hear my own heart beat it this one  i think how hyundai are designing their line up is very clever perfectly positioned to cover ice demand but establishing themselves as a clear midrange high quality ev manufacture,Hyundai Kona

2023-10-26,you missed the real first edition of the kona,Hyundai Kona
2023-10-13,looking forward to seeing this come to the us where there is a growing rival between new ev like the 2024 kona and tesla the big difference may be which ev is cheaper as tesla is made in america thus eligible for the full 7500 tax credit where hyundai is not as its made in s korea base tesla y models may actually turn out to be cheaper than the kona ev after tax credits are added into the price stay tuned,Hyundai Kona
2023-12-08,that will be interesting in the uk incentives for purchasing evs are disappearing so now credit and 0 road tax will end in 2025  there will be some petrol vehicles that pay lower road tax than an ev if that tax credit goes the same way and has a deadline tesla are in trouble from rival manufacturers importing to us,Hyundai Kona

2023-09-17,the old kona was faster i had it for 2 years,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-15,that central dash is horrific looks pre gen imo,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-18,it really does i thought i was the only one that thought so everyone else seems to love it for some reason but its horrific enough to put me off and go with a niro instead even if this has more kit,Hyundai Kona

2023-09-14,have a car manufacturers stopped making ice cars i know its hard to believe but some of us cant own electric cars i have on street parking so no home charger and very little infrastructure in my town for charging electric cars it would be nice if we were catered for come on what car how about some nonplugin hybrids,Hyundai Kona

2023-09-14,evsbatteries are too big too heavy too expensive and much of their energy is used lugging them around it appears we are 4 to 5 years away from solid state batteries which just might bring a reduction in weight increased range shorter charging times and maybe cheaper ev prices the sooner the better,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-14,hyundai have a knack for making cars which just look ugly and weird and this car is no exception those rear headlights look bizarre slung low on the sides like some kind of legally mandated afterthought the inconveniently asymmetric front charge port is bizarre the sharp lines combined with bulges looks odd its uncanny how they manage this almost every time the original ioniq and even the ioniq 5 look fugly too i was behind an ioniq 5 the other day and it looks so dated and trying too hard to be futurist and failing for a car which has only been out a couple of years,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-18,i love the ioniq 5 personally but holy cow this is horrific despite having less kit i would get the niro over this simply because of the 90s dash in this monstrosity,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-14,"nice review

any detail on some of the functions that reset on shutting down the v1 car

2023-09-18,because the dash in this is absolutely horrific looks like a 90s dash also the wait times on this are probably going to be far far longer as its brand new some cars are still up to a year wait,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-18,austin2planks interior of kia is way better is in all their cars always has been  is still true today had use of a kona recently whilst my niro was in for an insurance repair they are far from the same cars the kona just felt a poor relation still a good car but attention to detail lacking geared differently too no matter what they say in the garages or press 7 year warranty vs 5 is icing on the cake,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-14,still cant decide if i like the look of the car could be like the mg4 didnt look great on screen but is very nice in reality,Hyundai Kona

2023-09-14,i really dislike this trend that manufacturers are using to describe faux leather  vegan leather eco leather etc  in most cases its plastic so lets call it what it is and not make out that its a green alternative in any form,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-16,i also find it puzzling that vegan leather is described as sustainable isnt leather sustainable and biodegradable,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-16,charlesbridgford254its made of recycled greens the kind of leftovers that used to go on the compost heap,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-18,"charlesbridgford254 leather comes from cattle cattle are not ecofriendly raising cattle pollutes water ways and their methane emissions are contradictory to owning an ev 

faux leather can also be much softer and easier to clean than real leather

i own a car with real leather and i hate the leather seats too firm for driving for hours a day for my job faux leather can be made just as firm or softer than real leather because its a mix of vinyl and other recycled rubber materials its not just a sustainability thing its also a comfort thing

my friend has an ioniq 5 limited and his seats arent real leather either but they feel a helluva lot better than my real leather ones do",Hyundai Kona
2023-09-18,ncxdesigns cattle are not eco friendly far more eco friendly than plastic,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-21,"but theyre not they use recycled materials so they are eco friendly 

hyundai doesnt list it as vegan or biodegrable just eco friendly the journalist words not theres",Hyundai Kona
2023-10-03,its cheaper than leather so vegan is how theyre trying to sell the idea to consumers without admitting its purely a cost decision,Hyundai Kona
2023-10-12,drewzerniit also lasts longer and does not need as much maintenance it also feels better in every way its better then leather,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-20,ncxdesignsyou missed the part that leather is biodegradable and natural and a by product of feeding billions of people  until you change billions of humans nutritional habits leather is an absolute superior product hands down,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-24,"yes leather biodegrades in landfill takes about 50 years or so

plastic based leather obviously is 500 years 

funnily enough the co2 footprint is about the same if cattle is being raised as food and the leather is a by product it can be viewed somewhat differently i guess

but cattle are horrendous for the planet they use exponentially more water than humans or crops per acre plus all the co2 and methane they produce

neither are particularly great but had to say real leather if you look after it can last a very very long time most dont realise it needs moisturising and feeding etc to keep to going if you do that it can last so long you wont care

must say having had both you cant beat real leather it just feels nicer as a meat eater i dont think im in a position to lecture one way or the other tbh

until the destruction of vegan leather doesnt release micro plastics they shouldnt be used imho tho",Hyundai Kona

2024-04-26,for the small amount of us who are ethical vegetarians and avoid leather for that reason a vegan leather option is very much a plus thats what im looking for and now the market can actually sell it to me,Hyundai Kona
2024-05-06,it means its suitable for vegans vegans would object to actual leather,Hyundai Kona

2023-09-14,well balanced review,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-14,fine bit of woollarding there,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-14,i think using simple plastic on areas that are not toched often if durable is actually pretty clever it lets u get more features for your money and as u said they did make important parts like the steering wheel and the silver colored buttons feel good so no real complaints,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-18,i 100 agree hard plastic on the top of the door is a no go though as its somewhere many people rest their arms,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-14,although that charging point at the front looks very handy i am wondering if it could also be an issue a small front end shunt could turn into a very expensive repair and mean the car wont charge until it is fixed,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-14,i reckon not charging would be the least of worries as theres a trend in the auto insurance companies that heads toward claim adjusters not knowing if the battery pack and or high voltage system is damaged then not willing to accept any risk and writingoff evs with minor damage,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-18,home insurance for the owner and the owers neighbors are about to sky rocket as these cars are a fire hazzard world wide these batteries are exploding causing immense damage i think the ev scam is going to be short lived long live ice,Hyundai Kona

2023-10-15,100 agree putting charging port in front is a doa on my book,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-18,not to mention that it ruins the look of the front end looks like it was put there as an afterthought,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-24,"medroastt9888 it is the least of your worries the charging point is only a socket easy and low cost to repair the expensive things are things like cameras sensors and radar all that stuff is on the front of any ev inclusing tesla

personally a charging port on the left side of the car like on the tesla is a doa in my book most roadside chargers are on the pavement on the right side of the car unless you park against the flow which is forbidden in most countries this means your charging cableconnector is sticking out on the side where carsbikesetc can easily hit it  accidentally or on purpose",Hyundai Kona
2023-09-14,the position of the large  light clusters on corners of the bumpers is going to make parking scrapes expensive someone needs to tell hyundai designers what bumpers are supposed to do namely prevent expensive damage from small impacts,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-14,its a fair point although i reckon they might be tougher than they look,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-14,park more carefully please and what about sensors,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-18,sensors are there for a reason if you scrape the bumper even with front sensors you deserve the bill tbh,Hyundai Kona

2023-09-14,looks sharp wish the charging port was centred cant stand the nasty low grade plasticy materials  buttons still much prefer my kia niro ev4 for its plusher interior,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-14,i like them both the kona has the advantage that the heat pump is standard where as you have to pay extra for it in the niro ev i prefer the smaller 17 inch wheels in the niro ev bigger wheels in the higher spec konas means less comfortable ride and less range the basic spec kona does have the 17 inch wheels i still havent decided which one i prefer,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-14,looks are subjective i like it,Hyundai Kona
2023-09-14,yes i think it is ugly as well but at least the charging port is at the front were all evs should be,Hyundai Kona

2024-02-13,thank you for addressing the frunk been saying that all a long who in their right mind will open the bonnet on a bidaily basis to access the cable100 not me,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-14,you are right no one would keep the cable there if they were using it every 2 days but i have a cable i use rarely if ever and would keep it there rather than have it kicking about in the boot,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-12,can hyundai service repair the battery answer is no they can only replace it which could cost the customer big bucks  they shouldve built it on the egmp platform to reduce costs further   but no that wasnt done why develop a new platform and not use it why hyundai loses money on each ev they build,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-10,i have a choice between this and the mg zs ev    im torn but this look good,Hyundai Kona

2024-01-16,the hate isnt as bad as its made out however over doing it a bit on the prequels,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-15,similar kind of presentation as with the ioniq 5 only much later one has to find out that only a slight dent in the under carriage near the batteries would write off the car no mention by alex of the fire danger the enormous repair costs skyrocketing insurance range anxiety high charging costs and extreme depreciation it would be much appreciated if alex could be more honest in her presentations and give us the full picture instead of just the rosy fluff,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-10,currently have an ioniq 5 but the  lease up this year so looking at the new kona electric as i dont need ioniq 5 size and i prefer normal buttons ioniq 5 has been a lovely car thou,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-10,1 its a froot as in a front boot as we have boots in the uk not trunks and 2 its designed to put the cables in so you dont have to go to the other end of the vehicle and open the boot and then get the cable out from under the false floor of the boot where you just put them,Hyundai Kona

2023-12-23,having owned an eniro since march 2019 i can tell you that when youre on a long trip and are loaded up with luggage you dont need your charge cable this is because you are only interested in dc rapid chargers en route and of course they have their own cables we live in south west france and have done many long haul trips within france to uk switzerland and germany and the only reason to access the type 2 cable is when staying in hotels that offer free overnight charging by which time you have unloaded your cases and freed up the underfloor storage for the cablesjust thought i would throw in some real world experience there ,Hyundai Kona

caught cook strait ferry and drove picton  christchurch  stayed one week with motherinlaw  charged from her 10amp power point using our cable
drove christchurch  picton  stayed at jasmine court motel and charged with their complimentary 7kw charger using our cable  great service try to find accommodation that will give you a complimentary gastank top up  some new zealand retail shops are also offering free 7kw charging with your own cables
caught cook strait ferry and drove wellington  hastings  stopped for a meal and decided to add a bit of charge from a chargenet charger the only time we did not use our own cables
while we were travelling the back of the car was full to the brim  luggage computer printer bedding box of plant cuttings and an ebike
every time i charged with one of our own cables i said a quiet thankyou to the frunk  i cant think of anything else i would use it for  the charge port is right there
final bit of info for those pondering an ev  before this trip we have done 5500km 3400 miles in 5 months  our power plan supplies free electricity to our home daily from 9pm to midnight so we have spent a total of nzd1274 usd800 on fuel   whats not to like",Hyundai Kona
2023-12-28,ours experience on the same type of trips with our niro ev which is very similar to the new kona with a boot full of mountain bike gear which we dont empty into the hotel room having the cable in the frunk right next to the charging port is really useful and it saves seconds not having to walk from one of the car and back again ,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-16,it seems to be based on hyundai creta car,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-16,omg a company that listens to its customers  actual buttons wow,Hyundai Kona

2023-11-16,great review alex  very honest and actually a very nice car for families,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-16,the daft punk references are fantastic the game has changed made me smile especially love the tron soundtrack,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-16,"really like this actually evs make for really good family cars besides the potential charging worries theyre so nice and quiet and a car that isnt trying to be both comfortable and sporty all in one just makes sense 

just keep all the fun cars ice then everybody is happy ",Hyundai Kona
2023-11-19,dead right we have four ice performance cars in the garage and just ordered a kona ev for the family runabout on the company car scheme the bik is negligibleso its essentially a free car,Hyundai Kona
2023-12-24,test drove the mg4 xpower recently that thing smashes most smaller ice performance cars even some super cars cant keep up with its sub 4 second 0 to 60 time plus it has two motors that power all 4 wheels give me that absolute beast over any ice car for fun and raw acceleration almost 430 horse power too you wont find that kind of power in a brand new petrol car for 36000,Hyundai Kona
2023-12-24,"nomanspiethe mg4 xpower is on our company car list and i have one as a loaner at the moment once you get over the quick acceleration its not a very well rounded car handling is not great and apart from the fun of a rapid 060mph sprint the thrill of which wears off after a few runs its not a fun car to drive also the interior isnt great the screen is laggy the range isnt up to much in the cold it has loads of overly intrusive driver aids which you cannot permanently disable its definitely not something id want longterm 

there are a few evs that can match petrol for fun eg my friends taycan is a match for my 911 turbo but most evs have rapid acceleration but none of the poise weve come to expect from well engineered ice cars this will change in time but for now most evs are good for the family runabout but not proper performance motoring as weve come to love

060 figures do not make a fun car in fact my most fun car is my slowest at a humble 060mph in 6s",Hyundai Kona

2023-11-16,thumbs up alexyy,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-16,not my type of car but very much enjoyed the review much more relaxed and natural i cant believe i actually watched a full review video of kona ev though did make me wince when that awful frunk word was mentioned beetles 911s and all manner of other midengined cars have managed to survive for decades with having a boot in the front  why do we have to give it a new name just because musk decides to give it one in his teslas ,Hyundai Kona
2023-12-23,oohhh dear i just used the hated word in my comment above ill give myself forty lashes    ,Hyundai Kona

2023-11-15,"why on earth did they put the charging port in that front offset position
why not place it in the centre and make the opening symmetrical in shape and not odd shaped and if they were to leave it where it is then design something to match for the other side of the car to give it some balance
as it stands it looks horrid and whoever passed it off as a great front end design obviously didnt have their contact lenses in that day   8",Hyundai Kona

2023-11-15,looks like theres a couple of contrasting design languages going on here  the big triangle crease looks great on the ionic5 but looks crowbarred in on this more rounded aesthetic,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-15,spot on this one looks closer to crumpled paper whilst the ionic 5 looks like origami,Hyundai Kona

2023-11-15,great review alex,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-15,i really struggle with the starting price of 35000 for that money you can get a top specification full leather citroën ec4  or ec4 x with same range and power i also can not get past the rear lights on the wheel arches like they forgot them and put them on afterwards the front just looks like any chinese car,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-15,same price as a volvo xe30 ,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-15,rajuk4625 indeed you are correct  the volvo slipped my mind i havent seen the volvo ex30 in the flesh yet my guess is it is smaller vauxhall mokka  fiat 600 sized,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-15,mikadavies660  it does 060 in sub 4 secs too ,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-15,rajuk4625  you mean the volvo ex30 does yes but i would be interested to try the ex30 and the smart 1 brabus the testers have all prefered the smart brabus for handling we shall see as i have just yesterday booked a test drive for the smart,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-16,rajuk4625not at 35000 it doesnt,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-16,rajuk4625 i think the ex30 is a bit smaller than the kona,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-15,yet another ugly car of 2023 or should i say ev,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-15,what makes it ugly and why does it matter if its an ev,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-15,janhenkins first of all its yet another crossover which is the equivalent of a normal sized person who got really fat and started wearing high heals at the same time the square like front and back wing looks like something a diy person did themselves and stock on to the chassis in their home garage the pentagonal back lights are stock on to the back wings and does not fit the design of the light strip i could go on and on this is a design a 10 year old or a chinese person would really like to point out its an ev matters to some especially since they are being forced on to consumers as being more environment friendly by pointing the finger at the consumer it gives the politicians a free pass from doing something about the things that really matter to the environment,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-15,"jwester7009 fair enough on the looks of the car i can see why it doesnt appeal i like your anology about a portly person in high heels  with regards it being an ev i still dont see why that should be a negative i dont agree that they are being forced onto consumers and they are truly more environmentaly friendly i decided without being forced by anybody to buy a secondhand nissan leaf as an experiment it has obvious flaws ugly small battery etc but as a car it is the best vehicle i have ever owned it drives better costs less i pay less than 10 per month charging it where my previous car cost me approx 115 per month on diesel and does not blow co1 nox and particulants into the atmosphere my energy provider octopus energy gets 100 of their energy from renewable sources so it is good to know that my car is as green as i can make it but apart from it being green having this ev is a far more practical thing it performs extremely well even with modest power i can outaccellerate most gaspowered cars up to 30mph and costs almost nothing to run and maintain why would i go back to a gas car it simply does not make any financial sense

i also dont see why politics should be mentioned in a youtube videos comment section but since it was brought up we are at the start of a climate emergency largely caused by us this is not a fib lie fabrication or old wives tale the impersonal science shows it clearly to all who wish to see electric cars are only a small part of the solution although it is a very good start we have an enourmous amount of work to do in order to try and fight this monster we have created the only politics at play here would be the petroleum companies and their lobbyists buying off politicians to keep us in our place  a captive audience burning the stuff they sell us at a price that they control take note of any politician or journalist telling you that evs are bad and are being forced on people find out who they are and look into their background more often than not with a little bit of googling you might just find that they have ties to those monstrously rich petroleum companies that makes megatons of cash while people like us have problems affording the basics in life

so back to the car  yes its supremely ugly  although i think my old leaf could just be uglier than that and yet i find myself not caring at all and its an ev one tick in its favour but dang im now going to see that car on stilletos in my minds eye and i just cannot unsee it not hyundais finest work to be sure",Hyundai Kona

2023-11-15,wolvoman1if a front impact means no front charging then why do you think a side impact of comparable impact wouldnt mean no side charging,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-16,wolvoman1and your logic doesnt apply to ice vehicles with radiators at the front theyre the first thing to be broken in a front end shunt but it hasnt stopped manufacturers putting them there for the past 120 years ,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-16,phuketexplorer your replies are completely ott i am talking about minor collisions that could damage the charging socket not complete write offs or heavy damage,Hyundai Kona
2023-11-16,wolvoman1if it were just a minor shunt the charging port door would still be able to be prised open or removed completely in the highly unlikely event of having the accident when the battery was completely dead the engineers that design these parts arent stupid,Hyundai Kona

2024-02-08,headlamps placed at the extreme outer side of the front and back bumper looks very futuristic that is until you bump those pesky concrete walls ,Hyundai Kona

2024-02-08,just dont scrape the bottom of the car or youll be in for an expensive fix,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-18,maybe ignorant question but can i ask why,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-20,pipahlalah8711 there are other videos on yt that particularly in canada if you damage the battery protection tray underneath the car even just a scratch hyundai invalidate the warranty and write the whole car off,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-08,heres the thing its a nice car too look at but your final statement of its 40000 but thats just what evs are these days still doesnt make it right or justifiable plus itll cost a fortune to insure so how can an expensive ev be anywhere close to being recommendable as a car of year,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-08,indeed and paying for it on monthlys makes no difference  its still 40k,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-08,pallettowngangster9297 exactly,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-08,so now i have to look at the bumper to see if they are indicating seems a backward step for safety,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-10,really thats a poor excuse all cars have different indicators why moan about these ones ,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-08,why do they have to put the charge port at the front of the car ,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-08,so you can charge it,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-08,i wouldnt buy one with the port on the front i charge at home so need the rear charging port like my present hyundai ,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-08,patrickh7368 id argue that front port charging is better i have to park against a wall and my charger is on that wall if the port is on the back left side i cant reach the port with my cable without pulling it right around the car each time to charge if the port is on the right i cant get out my car unless i park it the other way round which will mean the cable is in the road front charging is perfect for me,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-08,mrneeds each to their own of course but for me charge cable would need to be twice as long and stick out in the direction of the public walkway  that rear passenger side suits me as i can still access the boot whilst charging  6 of 1 and half a dozen of the other i guess ,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-08,patrickh7368 indeed i like the flexibility of most cars nowadays theres an option for everyone,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-10,much better at the front,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-10,alantov lol  as mentioned its to suit but i wouldnt buy an ev with front charging port but not an issue at the mo with inflated prices on evs  mine never falters and 5 years old now at the time just same price as an ice car,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-07,patrickh7368 ive had a kia eniro since 2019 charge port is where it should be at the front for me to charge at home,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-07,kiaenirodiariesencore4270 lol and my hyundai is where it should be at the rear for me to charge at home   as mentioned its each to their ownnot for me on the front ,Hyundai Kona
2024-05-28,why not,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-07,good car but way too expensive i mean idk about gb prices but in eu  kona electric and model y are similarly priced  ofc kona got cooled seats head up and electric sunroof but space charging speed and range are on a different level,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-07,hate evs any ev lover replying to my comment can foff ,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-07,common sense has forwards for drive and backwards for reverse i have ruled out the manufacturers that ludicrously have forwards for backwards and back is forwards  crazy idea,Hyundai Kona
2024-03-15,i know its annoying and counterintuitive i understand why several manufacturers early on did it to keep it the same as ice automatics but by this time especially as its all electronically done and gear changing controls can be placed anywhere forwards for forwards back for back is obviously the sensible way its especially annoying if youve never driven an automatic before you switch to an ev as it makes absolutely no sense to have the directions reversed,Hyundai Kona

2024-07-17,what do you compare with,Hyundai Kona
2024-07-05,the petrol is not more agressive its the n line styling that is more agressive available on all types please do your homework properly,Hyundai Kona
2024-07-05,havenrail it seems we are having a battle of opinions which are very subjective when it comes to styling however the electric and combustion models have styling differences the nline electric has a much simpler grille design featuring the brands more futuristic pixel elements whereas the combustion model features a sportier honeycomb grille and more dynamic styling could i possibly suggest you please do your homework properly before commenting thank you ,Hyundai Kona
2024-07-06,autosocialuk i just bought one and spent weeks looking at the different models before deciding so i have done my homework,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-11,mine is arriving soo looked at loads niro too and kona was one for me,Hyundai Kona
2024-03-15,my daughter is thinking about purchasing one of these so your review was very timely the other vehicle she is considering is the kia nero any thoughts as to which would make the better purchase i see the koan has a heat pump as standard whereas this is a cost option on the niro im not familiar enough with evs to know how much of a benefit the heat pump is,Hyundai Kona
2024-03-16,the kona is a much better car from the specs as you mention heat pump as standard for heating cabin in very cold weathernot essential in our climate but will pay for itself if you keep the car for 5 years id say better range nicer interior however the niro is bigger and has a longer warranty it kind of depends on her priorities such as whether size price how shell fund itwhat deals are available for each availability and possibly other stuff is important lots of things to consider in this sort of major purchasing decision which is difficult to answer in a short reply also i would suggest you get her to look at the following video from another uk ev channel which is a very interesting take on the uk ev market presently httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuzj88bs1dje,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-27,is this kona ev advance,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-29,great review tish,Hyundai Kona

2024-01-19,hello dear lady you look great today with such cool bright red lipstick you seem to have perfect lips you are such a cool and hot lady driver i like you in general i want you,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-16,maybe more of a personal preference but im not sure how anyone can prefer the kia niro interior design to the 24 kona the screens are much better with no random curve and thinner bezels theres no ugly logo on the steering wheel theres a good array of buttons theres no fingerprint hogging gloss black there is nothing i can think of that the niro does better when it comes to that interior cockpit area of the car,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-16,i think retroic appearance at front console is gorgeous i love it by the way will you review togg t10x ,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-16,this is so awkward to be so elegant while reviewing a dirty car i am sorry but as a parisian you must be classy and glam and your car should meet your style,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-16,have you ever driven with grit on the roads  i got dirty just driving to the location,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-15,sorry what a load of rubbish im 6 foot seat right back no space behind and why would you need to do your hair in a electric car wasting power lol ,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-15,value for money car ,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-15,what are you conflicted about with regards to the interior i love the fact it has buttons as i really dislike everything being controlled through the screens andor haptic buttons which dont give that sense of confirmation as with traditional buttons i really like the interior,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-15,i think the centre console is ugly it looks like a radio from the 90s i prefer the angular kia but its all personal preference,Hyundai Kona
2024-05-16,autosocialuk i dont want to agree but i do  but then again the exterior seems to be a nod to the original robocop and that was 1987  so they went with a 1987 interior,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-15,kona will always be second best having being built from a combustion platform i do like what theyve done but a ground up ev wont be that much more especially used,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-15,this generation was built as an ev first and then a combustion second this time around ,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-15,good review tish but sorry the only good thing is they have kept the buttons on the facia outside the car is awful looking and that back end is horrid looking sorry but i am not a fan of any of this brands models now and its all to do with the styling,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-14,its an alright car cheers love,Hyundai Kona

2024-01-14,1257 its an excellent job by hyundai interior and all the front exterior design is much to plain and could have been better and whats up with those hidious rims something more attractive could have been put on,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-14,great review tish and so smartly dressed  very sophisticated and professional  just one question thoughare you still holding that little plastic container from underneath the armrest,Hyundai Kona

2024-01-14,good review but omg i cannot think of anything more bland and boring than an electric suv ok the exception these days is any car made by vw,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-14,i understand that i like the ioniq 5 a lot more than this as that feels futuristic,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-14,with the heavy deprecation electric cars are not the way forward and no cheaper to run unless you can charge at home,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-14,and dont forget youll need to pony up around 1k for a home charger,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-14,i think the pendulum will swing again but i understand your concerns they makes sense for motability customers at the moment as big discounts and free home chargers,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-14,hyundai makes interesting machines somehow my taste finds their cars ugly only nissan makes uglier cars,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-14,i really love the look of the 5  6 what do you think of the new santa fe,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-14,autosocialuk i have seen a photo of the new santa fe looks boring and uninspired as if they didint know how to design a car and opted to copy the design of an old range rover and stick the hyundai logo on it seriously when you see the new santa fe doesnt it remind you of a range rover,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-14,"right off the bat the design it definitely has that sleek sporty appearance and it also retains some of those familiar
features that you would find in other hyundai vehicles now the kona ev had several issues in the past mainly with the battery not enough range as it proclaims and when it sparks things go boom but the konas biggest problem is the competition aside from the kia niro ev theres also uks very own mg product as in the mg zs ev trust me that is a worthy alternative because its more reliable the price is reasonable and mgs are all over the place so lets see if the kona can remove its bad reputation and be the best selling subcompact electric suv in its lineup great review as always tish",Hyundai Kona
2024-01-14,ive never heard any concerns surrounding the range in fact ive always heard the opposite that theyre some at the best at achieving the predictions mgzs is definitely an opinion but there isnt as much space,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-14,autosocialuk  fair enough and yes the mg is lacking in space but its selling like hot cakes here in the caribbean,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-14,the gear shift and regen shift behind the steering wheels are almost identical to the ones on kia ev5 which is only available in china at the moment,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-14,many cars are now opting for this set up,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-14,typical hyundai over styled and over designed which always seems to make them age badly every hyundai thats a previous model always looks so dated and cheap indesign also shame about still being fwd i drive the old one and one of the things that put me off was the lack grip,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-14,"thats utterly rubbish and you know it if that were the case they would not be popular and there resale would be rubbish which it is not 
on fact if you look at the current i30 its actually quiet a bland car compared to the last one and this new kona is quiet bland yo compared to the last model do your whole overstyled statement us rubbish",Hyundai Kona
2024-01-14,i think styling is totally subject to personal taste they have addressed the lack of grip with a smoother power deliver but its still not perfect,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-15,lol go away then thanks for telling us you know nothing about cars ,Hyundai Kona
2024-01-15,ccjh0806 as mentioned styling is subjective thats why we dont all buy the same cars there is plenty of cars on the road that one person will love the look of and another will hate,Hyundai Kona

2023-11-18,i like the real buttons and knobs easier to use than touch controls especially when the car is moving will the 17 inch wheel also be available in the n line i prefer more range to bigger wheels,Hyundai Kona
2024-02-27,i think you can specify 17 or 19 inch wheels as a no cost option on the n line and top spec model,Hyundai Kona

2023-10-26,so there is a kona nline in the hybrid model the kona nline for the ev comes in january,Hyundai Kona
2023-12-16,the n line interior is really nice  think itd be the sweet spot of the ev range great vid guys  you do a solid job,Hyundai Kona
2024-07-22,so there actually is a digital speedometer  its just a setting in the instrument cluster your video just shows the classic appearance option,Hyundai Kona
2024-06-17,our first new car was a kona 2020  a real lemon  used a lot of oil and the car dealer said it was within limits and did nothing we will never buy a hyundai again,Hyundai Kona
2024-06-15,trunk opens when you stand behind it,Hyundai Kona
2024-06-23,dealership said my new kona sel awd does not offer ability to autoopen although i like it as it is an autoopening trunk would make it all the more likeable,Hyundai Kona
2024-06-08,put the key in your pocket stand directly behind the tailgate for a couple of seconds and it should open automatically i t does have  a digital speedometer,Hyundai Kona
2024-05-15,we bought a ltd a month ago and we really like it but with no spare available we are concerned what happens with a blowout that air compressor is going to be useless they should at least make one available very disappointed  with hyundai for that,Hyundai Kona
2024-05-06,the nliner trim is fcking gorgeous,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-28,the cameravideo images presented in this great youtube post show angles of the kona that really are appealing i am warming up to this vehicle as a result,Hyundai Kona

2024-04-16,im cross shopping this and the cx30 na i still lean towards the na cx30 lol,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-14,im currently driving a 2022 kona limited fwd ice and im not sure if id lease another after driving two models 2019 and 2022 instead im seriously considering the 2024 kia niro phev sx touring which uses the same 16 l engine as kona  without the turbo  but with the electric motor attached i would get 33 miles of pure ev before the gas engine kicks in i dont drive 33 miles in one day more like 10 miles a day usually that would save me a lot of money at the gas pump meanwhile the niro is about the same size but doesnt look like an armored tank like the kona plus the kia and hyundai small suv share similar interior layouts,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-09,the humming sound is probably the air purifier working under the drivers seat,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-08,hands free tailgate on the kona is not one you wave your foot under the bumper stand behind the car and stay in place for around 3 seconds lights will flash and it will open provided its activated in the infotainment system  it can be turned off,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-07,just bought a 2024 kona nline love her already,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-04,i am tired of all the reviews on just the upper trims what about the lower trims,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-14,keep in mind that 99 of the youtube reviews are with vehicles provided by hyundai so of course they will promote the top trims,Hyundai Kona
2024-06-02,agree hank drives me nuts,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-02,i own one of these it most certainly does have a digital speedometer you can configure from analog to digital gauges the tach even becomes digital,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-07,i also own one and while it does have one its not configurable to be in the middle of the gauge which is something a lot of people are used to,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-07,"mokurt2529 i understand ive had lots of cars where the digital speedometer is not right in the middle 
i also have a 2023 lincoln nautilus where the digital speed is on the middle but if you configured the drivers display to show other features it moves off to the side i can live with it its not a deal breaker with my hyundai or lincoln",Hyundai Kona
2024-04-09,jimmoritz553 about how much to fill it up im considering a kona im looking for a primary vehicle ,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-28,mine projects the data onto the passenger side inner windshield,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-29,how are you finding your kona were thinking of picking one up next year we want the electric,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-29,marykay8587 i love the car i have no desire to own an ev though we drive 5000 a year so an ev is not cost effective for us and we like all wheel drive im very satisfied with the fuel economy considerably higher than rated,Hyundai Kona
2024-05-04,jimmoritz553 hows that ambiant lighting at night my guess is pretty sharp,Hyundai Kona
2024-05-06,same here about 5000 miles a year so far we really like the car and youre right the fuel economy is considerably better than what it is rated at,Hyundai Kona
2024-03-31,that single bar in the center of the steering wheel actually has 4 dots which is morse code for h  thats instead of having a hyundai logo,Hyundai Kona
2024-04-28,it actually is meant to be five dots the designers simply omit the fifth one in the north american markets,Hyundai Kona
2024-03-27,"we just got the awd kona limited for 31k which feels like a bargain i love everything about this suv except that the gas tank is a little small drives are very quiet and relaxing in the city but more noisy on the interstate with loud wind sounds a quiet smooth drive coupled with a very well thought out interior and cooled seats in florida makes all the difference i love this car so much that im searching for videos like this to see if im missing any of the features 

from my understanding hyundai pay allows you to pay automatically at certain parking garages

love the wireless car play and pleasantly surprised by hyundais navigation capabilities to view turn by turn directions straight ahead without having to look at the map",Hyundai Kona
2024-04-28,can i ask what was the otd price i have the old version and thinking of upgrading,Hyundai Kona
2024-05-02,silver33we spent 31k and it was originally 38k my better half is just good at negotiating,Hyundai Kona

2024-04-16,nice job on the review  i purchased my kona limited back in november of 2023 i chose the fwd instead knowing the back suspension would not be as good  the one thing i wish i had known was that hyundai does not include a spare tire unless its the awd  huge disappointment given that you cant even get it via 3rd party vendors otherwise after getting the ota update for wireless android auto im very happy w the car,Hyundai Kona

2024-04-29,me and my husband want to pick up one next year ,Hyundai Kona
2024-03-10,i really love this design but i hate the mismatched irregular shape fender flairs i lean a little more toward liking the kia seltos the cousin to this kona the styling is less objectionable and its priced a few hundred dollars lower when comparably equipped given the wild styling of this vehicle i think it was a missed opportunity that hyundai didnt put some wild patterned and colored cloth upholstery in the lower trims the outside is wild and the interior is so monochromatic a strange juxtaposition the twist shifter is super cool it seems logical to use and frees up console space i wish it was a standard feature and yeah the kona has gotten awfully expensive now the kona is definitely not the value leader for the segment that honor goes to the chevy trax with a price range of about 21k27k hyundai has historically always been the value leader even undercutting domestic brands but they seem to be aiming upmarket nowadays,Hyundai Kona

2024-06-12,bought one last week same colour and top gt spec,Peugeot e2008
2024-02-27,"do not buy this car i own one and intend to do a review after having one for 24 months here are my thoughts  i own the gt one so take this 

pros

 looks  they look great inside and out its the bestlooking peugeot theyve ever designed 
 extras as standard again im speaking about the gt model but you get almost all the extras as standard including heated seats auto foldin wing mirrors sunroof cruise control laneassisted cruise control  drives itself on motorway collision avoidance and detection  led lights with auto high beam proximity key unlock and smartphone charger usb ports reversing and parking assist camera 
 boot space decent boot space for the size of car
drive its a really nice car to drive thanks to comfort 
charging  ccs charging which is great when on longer trips 

cons  and there are plenty 

 range the range is pathetic really mine is the 2021 model and on full charge you are looking at 200 miles range on the clock  in reality you get no where near that probably 150 miles at a push in winter uk you might be as low as 100 miles on full charge for context my commute is 34 miles there and back 3 days a week mostly motorway at under 70 mph and i do about  50 miles social driving so roughly 150  200 miles a week on i have to charge at least twice a week i dont speed and am pretty conservative  winter with frost you are looking at every other day you will not get 150 miles on a round trip if its a mixture of motorway and urban  also driving eco does practically nothing in terms of range improvements 

 price you could get a tesla for the same price doesnt look as nice but for performance and everything else tesla wins its probably overpriced for what it is 

 software  the peugeot app is the single worst app i have ever used i could write a full comment on that it doesnt connect it logs you out fully you have to enter the pin and then log back in sometimes you have to uninstall the app because it just wont work if you want to precondition the battery on a cold morning you better set aside 5 minutes of waiting its unbelievably slow to connect to your car and then performing any operation is even slower 

and get this  you should precondition your battery when its cold it improves the range but you cannot precondition the battery if its less than 50 i think this is the only car that does this nor can you plug in your car and set it to precondtion overnight it just doesnt work 

service intervals are set in km although the odometer is in miles so the first time i took mine in for service was told it wasnt needed  i have seemingly random service intervals now 

you cant charge to a certain like other evs as other suppliers do not recommend 100 charge 

you have to plug in a usb to update car software even though it can connect to wifi and services 

sometimes you get prompts in french particularly errors which is useful 

trip information updates randomly often not at all 

it doesnt update the service history even though the log is now digital

your phone will pull up high battery use for the app as its not optimised 

you can only register one phone per car even if you have more than one driver 

there have been no major updates the whole time i owned the car despite the fact everyone that uses it hates it 

interior  the touch screen is pretty unresponsive and although you get a larger screen theres a pointless alwaysthere aircon widget on either side of the screen so you lose about 20 of the screen which is small as it is  the wireless phone charger is not angled properly as such you may think your phone is charging but if its not on the sweet spot it wont be 

build quality just coming up to the 3rd service interval and have been had several faults appear in the past week resulting in around 1k of charges luckily mine is a lease and under warranty repairs needed include new ball joints new brake pads despite using the engine breaking 80 of the time an electrical error not sure what it was just told by dash to take to dealer heated seats stopped working 

the green accent paintwork on the badge for the ev cars which they have since discontinued on  has flaked off 

so in summary looks great drives great range is poor its overpriced and has seemingly been overlooked for the evonly parts 

get something else for the price and forego looks",Peugeot e2008

2023-09-30,peugeot make nice looking cars but theyre expensive and residuals are shocking so no sane person would buy one,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-29,nobody has yet explained the point of ev as environmentally it makes no sense am talking the whole process of everything to make an ev from digging to get at raw materials too what powers the charges etc etc etc  just wish all you car shows asks serious question or are you afraid that you be cancelled by the governmentmanufactures seems to me the only honest personcompany to this question is toyota yes they make ev but they still ask the question,Peugeot e2008

2023-09-27,well i drive an e208 so basically have a smaller brother of this its a really nice car but as residuals are showing now its way overpriced and this refresh doesnt change that one bit given youll be able to get a one year old for 23k in a years time im amazed anyone would buy this privately maybe they give huge discounts and low rate finance now,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-28,its mostly being leased around here,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-27,its such a major no go for me in cars that automatic gear sticks are turning into something so absolutely ridiculous as a lille switch besides the car looks great but sadly the car will likely be way overpriced,Peugeot e2008

2023-10-11,"the problem with the kia eniro is the slower charging speed 
my ev road trip planner calculates faster trip with an faster charging citroën ec4 with shorter range than a slower charging with longrange kia eniro for a 1000 mile trip",Peugeot e2008
2023-11-19,tomtom9879 i agree that the slower charging on the niro is disappointing  i dont even get the advertised 77kw  ive never had more than 53kw fortunately i dont do many journeys more than 240 miles and charge at home,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-27,range price you gotta be kidding me no thanks,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-27,as always with psa the cars are designed to be electric or gas or hybrid probably because stellantis cio is always lobbying to postpone the switch to evs to maximise short term profits and his huge incomes so this car is a compromise and it cannot be the best and sadly this strategy does not even make this car cheaper so it is for people who are really in love with the brand,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-27,why are people still mentioning psa they combined with stellantis years ago friend and peugeot is one of many of the stellantis brands who are leading the way in the switch to fully ev,Peugeot e2008
2023-10-03,lhawkesdrumsthe didnt combine they became stellantis the name didnt exist before,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-27,too expensive by about 10k   steel wheels    why a massive grill for an electric car  hump between the rear seats  why just why  oh i know why because  peugeot seem set on just using ice vehicles and then slapping an electric motor in and calling it good rather than actually designing  electric vehicles from scratch like the car manufacturers in china are doing,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-27,looks very smart  as peugeot products do these days no interest in the ev version petrol version for me which is what ive ordered,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-27,can i ask why you would order these new considering their price falls second hand after a year,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-27,for me the biggest improvement is the fact it has the letter e in front of it im not a fan of pointless front grills on evs though,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-27,just another stellantis compliance clone,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-27,why on earth does a front wheel drive electric car still have the remnants of a transmission tunnel cluttering up the rear floor  this car is an overpriced hangover of the past come on stellantis youre nearly there with the astra lets have an all electric reasonably priced giulietta replacement a smallish light car that looks good and is fun to drive in fact everything an alfa should be and not a very expensive big suv like the tonale or the stelvio,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-27,because stellantis cio plans to sell new ice cars for as long as possible even after 2035 in europe with the help of more and more lobbying so no plateforme dedicated for evs at peugeot,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-29,or because this platform have been used for 4 yrs and petrol models still sell at a much higher percentage buy the time of ice ban the next 2008 will be out on dedicated e architecture,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-29,jackweednm1vq sure but it is the same minimum investment in evs it could be a good strategy if the result was lower costs but no this ev is not cheaper at the end of the day sells will be very low for this car while it is supposed to be new to mach the concurrence in 2023 you need dedicated ev plateformes,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-29,didierpuzenat7280 but it doesnt seem worthwhile for manufacturers given the better selling dedicated evs id3 cupra born and fiat 500e have all had their production paused due to demand and were talking top 10 best selling evs i think the e2008 was the best selling electric bsuv for a period in europe it makes sense we are still early on in ev adoption as a percentage of total passenger vehicle sales it makes sense that a car past the point of facelift stage is not on dedicated ev architecture the next gen will be and before any bsuvs from a number of its competitors the epuma is yet to launch which wont be dedicated arochirecture and the e2008 is more than halfway through its lifecycle,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-29,jackweednm1vq maybe there is indeed a lack of demand but not for evs since tesla sells are great so the goal for automakers should be to close the gap with tesla and soon chinese evs and it will be difficult when you have to make compromise because your plateforme must be compatible with an internal combustion engine for example it will be difficult to have a bigger battery in the e2008 or to switch to lfp however i am not saying that this e2008 is doomed just that is will mostly appeal to fans of the brand or people not well informed of what other brands have to sell eg because they are used to go to a peugeot dealer and of course for a few buyers with specific needs this e2008 will be the best car,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-29,didierpuzenat7280 yes agreed all my explanation wasis is that the e2008 and been pretty well positioned for the last 4yrs and will remain competitive as this review explain for at least another two yrs then time for the new dedicated platform thats why i think its been a good strategy tesla also had the desirability of being totally electric not being a legacy for the early adopters who are into tech etc the legacy are better aligned for the remainder than will adopt more slowly secondly i still personally think theres space for a direct tesla competitor if were going to make more ethics and considered purchases tesla has draw backs elon also undermines the brand and his customer base but thats a separate issue,Peugeot e2008

2023-09-27,it seems really poor to charge for the heated elements of the car when the competition include them even in the base versions it strikes me that peugeot are still too far behind the koreans and the chinese this is an old technology car and nothing can disguise that its still doesnt have enough room for a disabled driver to fit a reasonable size wheelchair in the back or in the boot,Peugeot e2008

2023-09-27,nice car but pricey for what is basically a jacked up e208 and the wltp range is not as good as the kona niro ev and renault megane etech which are around the same price to compete with those it needs to be cheaper i personally would wait for the price to come down or better still get it second hand in about 2 years time,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-27,ill continue waiting for the tsunami of chinese evs to arrive in a few years to bring ev prices down to approx 20000no way im going to pay 36000 for a car,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-27,i wouldnt buy a chinese ev for patriotic reasons i prefer stuff made in europe or usa i agree with you these current evs are too expensive while not giving you much hoever finally there is one that might change this next gen 3008 will start selling in the next few months supposedly it will be the car with the longest range in the world when it comes to under 50 000 cars,Peugeot e2008

2023-09-27,hydrogen is the technology of the future and it it always will be,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-27,hydrogen has no future for ground transportation neither cars bus trucks or even trains you need 5 times more electricity with a hydrogen car than with a battery car so 5 times more wind turbines andor solar panels and of course at least 5 times more money to drive not to mention the infrastructure to build while electricity is everywhere regarding petrol up to you but i guess that in less than 10 years nobody will want to buy a petrol car and maybe not even own one then the car makers that still rely on ice will go bankrupt and sadly the employes will be out of job without proper qualification for the new norm,Peugeot e2008

ive only been an ev driver for about 8 months in a 4 years old leaf but i would have no hesitation in recommending an ev to anyone looking for a change of car  they are so quiet and relaxing to drive yet have such instant acceleration in  around town where it can be really helpful plus even compared to the 55mpg prius hybrid i had before my fuel cost is about a 14 of what i was spending on petrol  and im not even on the cheapest electricity tariff either
evs are absolutely the way forward 
my only caveat would be get something with around a 200 mile wltp range as the driver will need a comfort break before the battery is empty  my 100 mile leaf is just a little compromised on a longer motorway trip not unusable by any means but longer trips just need a bit more wheretochargeonroute planning",Peugeot e2008

2020-11-27,no costs far more than the petrol version and importantly charging times and availability of charging points is a dealbreaker for now  of course charging technology will improve although consider how queues build up at busy petrol stations then imagine how much worse it will be when each ecar needs at least 5 minutes to fuel up  charging over night at home doesnt sound viable for people living in flats or those without drivewaysgarages,Peugeot e2008

very true but even if you do have the money not everybody wants to spend 60000 on a car
if thats the thing that makes you happy go for it but to many people a car is a practical object to get you from a to b so if you can do that safely in comfort and quick enough in a nice looking car that costs half of that amount theres really no need to spend more",Peugeot e2008

2022-03-27,i love the small steering wheel i went from a peugeot to a seat and instantly missed the small wheel not sure what it is it feels more responsive and alive also the puretech engine takes some beating far better than most tsi engines that seem rather lethargic,Peugeot e2008

2022-03-08,that instrument visual problem suddenly the old citroen one spoke steering wheel becomes a stroke of genius also the steering wheel in the original c4 with the fixed centre makes it so much easier to find the controls if your wheel is turned or turning but i have to say i tried the peugeot steering wheel and loved it for handling,Peugeot e2008

1 must be nice to have money for this sort of thing
2 regen braking once you lift off fine but do remember your brake lights are poking the driver behind you into defensive action every time you consciously or unconsciously do that which i can say from experience is exhausting
regarding that i feel as though there should be three types of brake light on every new car slowing downregen just left  right brake lights braking including the top bar crash stop left  right top bar rapidly blinking
3 this guy could sell me anything which is kinda scary now i think about it",Peugeot e2008

2021-10-07,stopping the car by lifting off the throttle sounds dangerous to me you might end up getting rear ended also the instrument cluster might be mounted low to keep stray light away,Peugeot e2008

2020-12-23,"i have taken delivery of this car this week and have jotted down some things that annoy me

 ev charger wont pull out if you dont do it immediately after unlocking if you fail you then have to close all doors and the boot lock the car and unlock it again a nightmare if you have kids or passengers 
 bottom of doors inside the car get dirty  water makes its way in somehow
 kwph graph on the infotainment totally pointless as its y axis scale goes to 120kwh per mile stupid as youll only ever get between 25 so the graph is miniature and therefore pointless 
 mypeugeot app took ages to connect  like a week and its an incredibly clunky process 
 apple carplay cancels any radio station youre listening to and just sits there in silence until you go all the way through settings and find radio again
 no setting for defaul blower speed so it always comes on max which is both loud and unpleasant trying to change it is a real faff with all the touchscreen ui 
 water runs in boot if you open it whilst the car is wet
 cant set pre condition temperature  so even after i got the app working you cant select a temperature youd like to set the car decides for you usually around 22 degrees so much for setting it to be like a fridge when youre 10 mins away from your car and its 38 degrees outside",Peugeot e2008

2020-10-08,matthew railton hello actually i do it quite often the 200 miles range wouldnt be a problem if a charging network would be available everywhere the two typical situations where you would charge your car throughout the day are when the car sits at work and at home most workplaces dont have parking for their employees and much less charging stations most people dont have garage at home where they could charge so they would have to rely on public charging network which is poor and of low quality b speed charging speed charging is still a problem because it takes to long so if you need to make a long trip it will increase in a few hours the time to arrive to your destination a small business owner that relies on its car to go to place a to b as fast as he can an return electric car would be a problem also because charging network still is of poor quality and small tesla network aside you can even find yourself having to wait a few hours along the way not only when you charging but even to get a spot to charge your car finally charging cost typically if you charge at home it will be cheaper to run an electric car than a ice car but if you have to rely on public network thats no longer the case specially you you use the ionity network,Peugeot e2008

additionally go and investigate the munro teardowns of teslas and youll find that their culture of continuous iteration is already accomplishing things that traditional automakers cant touch tesla does quite a few traditional manufacturing things worse than legacy automakers but their rate of improvement is _dizzying_  trust me no one in automotive engineering takes them anywhere near as lightly as naysaying laypeople do",Peugeot e2008
2020-10-06,"stephandolby dont treat reliability like a single metric the things that really matter on a tesla battery and drivetrain have fewer points of failure than their ice equivalents

likewise the manufacturing quality at teslas shanghai plant is already better than their fremont site is anyone prepared to bet that their german manufacturing quality wont be even better dont just judge tesla by their hereandnow judge them by their trajectory there is precisely one auto manufacturer on earth that is currently making an admittedly slim profit selling evs every other manufacturer is currently producing them at a loss see compliance cars comments elsewhere in this thread i agree that vw group is likely to be the first of the traditional automakers to join tesla in that bucket but for now theres one clear volume and technology market leader in ev manufacturing and its not vw group",Peugeot e2008

2020-10-06,q j well coming from a porsche fanboy me the taycan is a bit expensive compared to teslas range and etc but this is porsches first try and also using more complex and different battery technology to teslas which make it much more harder and expensive to manufacture and porsches are made not for range and screen gimmicks its just for the appeal of driving a porsche which is handling speed and dynamics although porsches do have the upper hand in interior quality as well as said to last longer compared to teslas where they start to get glossy and cheaper in the future nonetheless there will always be progression but there is that extra tax with buying a german car sorry if my english is bad its not my first language,Peugeot e2008
2020-10-06,intel uhd graphics 630 your english is fine but my point remains the top end taycan is double the price of the top end model s so it better be faster and perform better in a race track but its software battery technology efficiency and apfsd cant even match a 2012 tesla model s they are way behind where it matters with evs porsche has been making cars for many decades tesla has not,Peugeot e2008

ive only been an ev driver for about 8 months in a 4 years old leaf but i would have no hesitation in recommending an ev to anyone looking for a change of car  they are so quiet and relaxing to drive yet have such instant acceleration in  around town where it can be really helpful plus even compared to the 55mpg prius hybrid i had before my fuel cost is about a 14 of what i was spending on petrol  and im not even on the cheapest electricity tariff either
evs are absolutely the way forward 
my only caveat would be get something with around a 200 mile wltp range as the driver will need a comfort break before the battery is empty  my 100 mile leaf is just a little compromised on a longer motorway trip not unusable by any means but longer trips just need a bit more wheretochargeonroute planning",Peugeot e2008

2020-11-27,no costs far more than the petrol version and importantly charging times and availability of charging points is a dealbreaker for now  of course charging technology will improve although consider how queues build up at busy petrol stations then imagine how much worse it will be when each ecar needs at least 5 minutes to fuel up  charging over night at home doesnt sound viable for people living in flats or those without drivewaysgarages,Peugeot e2008

2024-01-07,we have a 208 ev 2022 in ireland and it went in for the 15000km service and the dealer rang and wanted 80 for a pollen filter when i told them i have a service plan with the car the attitude changed then at 22000km we had to get the windscreen replace due to a large stone chip and when i went back to collect the car i was told that they cant calibrate the camera that there might be something wrong with the windscreen so i rang the crowd that put the windscreen and they told me to come in to them which is an hours drive and guess what they calibrated the camera in 20 minutes now the issue is the dealer handed back the car to a customer with some of the safety features not working thats not good and finally the car went in for the 30000km service and on the way home the service light came on so i checked the pollen filter and it wasnt changed thats some service from peugeot my guess is the car wasnt serviced they just stamped the book i made 2 complaints to peugeot ireland and nothing was done so we are finished with peugeot and we are finished with electric one filter to change and they couldnt even do that,Peugeot e2008

the peugeot e2008 certainly looks the part but how does it compare to the other compact suv electric cars on the market its beautifully made and easy to drive but for a car with a usable battery of 45kwh you might expect a better real world range than this offers the inside is comfortable and it has a decent boot but it lacks a reversing camera and has some quirky internal lights that look flashy but are a bit distracting the e2008 is a decent effort but in an increasingly crowded market for compact suvs does it do enough you tell us

2020-11-17,"as a peugeot salesman im confused as to the spec you have been given the allure does not have a camera but the gt line should have you dont have to go to gt to get a camera

looking at the model you have it is a gt line with options it has not got the alcantara interior but it does have the panoramic roof

real life range should be about 180 from personal experience in town but maybe a lot less on motorways also peugeot marketing has been using the wltp of 190200 not the nedc

the ambient lights colour can be changed and also lowered or turned off completely

there is a button on the end of the wiper stalk to show you your trips including mile per kwh 

love the vids and i would love to answer any questions you might have as someone who is actually dealing with these models on a daily basis its a shame that it just arrived and a peugeot rep didnt run through some of the controls and features with you things like the trip meter is something i would have shown you within the showroom let alone when you actually drive the car",Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,1818joe thanks for that response joe and i cannot tell you the frustration level of knowing how to view the trip meter gggnnnn it is also part of the problem of not having the car for longer and also not doing enough research my fail but all that aside i genuinely loved the car,Peugeot e2008

2020-12-10,i love fully charged and the channel has been a big support  in helping me buy my first ev however this is sloppy journalism as most of roberts complaints about the e2008 are just factually wrong as robert has now admitted he didnt do his research properly or bother to work out the controls on the car therefore this is a bit harsh on peugeot and i do feel fully charged need to correct or redo this video but accurately and fairly this time,Peugeot e2008
2021-03-01,"hi bobby i think its worth reminding people watching on these reviews that the cars built on the same platforms as ice cars are always less efficient than native evs eg leaf teslas zoe and hence youre going to pay the same price for whats a manufacturers first attempt also which is more energyhungry and prolongs the manufacture of the combined iceev platforms as you could be paying for a fully sorted ev 

if sustainability and efficiency is the goal i think theres enough choice on the market now to push people towards the native evs over retrofit evs like this much like fully charged used to encourage people to simply buy bevs over hybrids and rangeextenders  from a long suffering ev and battery engineer",Peugeot e2008
2024-06-29,what does it cost to go a charging station in the city to fully charge the battery from near 0,Peugeot e2008
2024-05-08,this has just dropped 25000aud in price in australia at least making it one of the cheapest cars on the market its low enough to make it possible for me but after watching review after review and looking at the specs i just cant see the value even at that price poor range average performance ice chassis no reversing cameras and it cant even tow a trailer the byd atto 3 may not have the name but it sure has the features  guess im waiting for the next crop to hit our shores and hopefully the prices keep the downward trajectory,Peugeot e2008

2023-04-30,so you charged it absolutely full and it said 130 miles but then after driving it many miles you say you have 124 miles left as a reviewer no as any car owner you should know the number on the display is calculated in several ways and depends massively on the way you drive it and where you drive it city or motorway so you shouldnt be pointing out only 130 miles instead of the projected 267 miles on the nedc standard which nobody uses everybody uses the wltp standard before youve actually driven it point is if you are looking to find negatives you will find them whether they are relevant and real or not this car isnt perfect but the perfect car will never be made so point out the faults but dont complain as if the car is rubbish because it has faults as that is how it comes over to me,Peugeot e2008
2023-04-30,i know where youre going with its built for a combustion engine but theyve adapted it for an electric motor but if the design is nice is it really necessary for the car to scream out im an ev and what should that be then the front window on top of the front bumper so people would know there cant be a combustion engine there nothing wrong with having the car look like a car in my opinion the only thing not enough manufacturers do is take advantage of the extra available space in the frunk but that supposedly is partly because its harder expensive to fit in frunks and pass crash tests at least thats an explanation i heard from a smart executive who explained why theres only a tiny 15l frunk in the smart 1 and to come back to my first point the old tiny smart cars hardly had an engine compartment and they never became a success partly because they just looked weird to many people so now smart has changed directions and their new car although an ev looks like a car instead of a box on wheels,Peugeot e2008
2023-04-22,how would this do for a family of 4 with a 4 and a 6 year old,Peugeot e2008
2023-04-17,you could drive a solar powered car at 20 miles an hour all day long and it would be more energy efficient than a freaking candle but i still couldnt care less so your mpg to kwhkm comparison means nothing to me to be honest i drive a diesel with a 45l fuel tank and get 1000 kilometers of range out of it and fill up after around 800kms for conveniences sake and theres not really any chance in hell id consider making the switch to a car that i have to plug in every day drive 1 hour to my office and have to plug it in there again just so i can turn on the ac on my way back with some peace of mind,Peugeot e2008
2023-04-18,"just try to imagine how many comments weve received almost word for word the same as this one you posted 
do you think anyone is interested in how far you can drive in a clunking dirty inefficient dated and incredibly dull old diesel
a machine that requires this country to import toxic expensive heavily subsidised fossil fuel from the most corrupt and corrupting regimes in the history of humanity
but forget all that if it means you can drive 1000 km without stopping while you leave a trail of genuinely poisonous gas behind you then screw everyone else you can drive a long way and fill up quickly oh silly me surely that is the single most important technical achievement the human race has ever achieved
never ever think outside your narrow blinkered little world at the impact your actions have on the rest of the population screw them all they dont matter as long as you can drive 1000 km non stop every freaking day then you just carry on sunshine no one gives a stuff bye",Peugeot e2008

2022-12-11,"i just had one of these as a loaner while my diesel car was in for a service i have to say i thoroughly enjoyed driving it so much so that i just drove aimlessly around for a while just to experience it some more i liked the smooth linear power delivery and of course how quiet it was some have mentioned intrusive road noise but i didnt find it intrusive at all it rode quietly and smoothly and i drove over some very rough roads space inside was ok too im 6 and i found the space in the back seat behind me was more than adequate 
i did find visibility a little restrictive though the rear view mirror because of the sharply raked windscreen was half way down the windscreen and blocked a lot of the view to the left also i found judging the near side a bit tricky due to the high bonnet line so squeezing through narrow gaps in traffic was a little tricky at first but i quickly go used to it 
i also liked all the high tech in the car such as sat nav apple and google play reverse camera inductive charging for smart phones etc you couldnt ask for anything more
as for range i got it fully charged and in eco mode it had a range of 192 miles this went down to about 170 miles in normal and 150 i think it was in sport mode i found eco mode a bit sluggish and the accelerator required a fair push to get moving along nicely also heatingair con was restricted in this mode too normal and sport were more like an ice car and it was these modes i used most when i took it back eco mode was showing a range left as 100 miles i hadnt done 92 miles only about 50 but i had used normal and sport modes a lot and had the heating on so that must have been where the extra charge was used
to sum up i was quite impressed with this looks bigger than what it is little car and seriously considered considered getting one until i discovered the price the spec i had was a new allure premiumgt with just 300 miles on the clock it retailed at a fraction below 40000 thats a hefty price to pay for an electric motor and some lithium batteries i thought im still considering though  mainly to use locally which is most of my driving anyway and also because the tech intrigues me
this all electric car is not something to use if youre doing lots of motorway miles but they are a great city car and 95 or more of us do drive mostly locally as we all know they have no exhaust so dont pollute locally or wherever youre driving they simply move the pollution elsewhere ie the power station where the pollution can be dealt with in one place with various filters etc which is a big plus i think",Peugeot e2008
2022-11-20,we are currently renting one of these and as much as i think its a lovely car i am utterly confused by the milage we are getting  we are getting about 60miles on a full charge  yes after charge it says 160miles but as we start on a journey with it in eco mode and driving carefully with the meter constantly in eco boom the range drops like a stone  id love anyone to give us an idea of what we are doing wrong to get such poor performance as as car i love it,Peugeot e2008

2021-10-25,i am a fully charged fan and also like mr llewelyn but this is both at their worst an underresearched review thats overwhelmed by the rantfest about nondedicated ev vehicle architecture suvs in general legacy manufacturers ev pricing models etc mainly  valid criticisms but this was supposed to be a car review and somewhere an editor  director should have been doing both and either wasnt or was overruled the car review element of this was underwhelming,Peugeot e2008

2021-02-25,"yeah evs are are on the march global pr media army is doing its best to persuade people how evs are the next best thing after fire and maybe hot water but in reviews like this is i miss more balanced views for example many of us think evs are really soulless and dull vehicles when driving is considered driving an ev for me is like driving a car in a computer game much too often very soft and lukewarm on general feedback from road brakes or steering wheel booooring i also wonder if mr robert is really satisfied with countless waiting hours needing for battery to refill ok he uses fast chargers and drives these cars on automotive companies cost so it is easy to understand his enthusiasm but what if he was just a common user who would drive only his nissan leaf of first generation would he still be so enthusiastic with slow charging and slow driving on highways managing cables every time he stop somewhere or paying a very high price for such a car yes yes i can hear you saying yeah let them doubters drive conventional vehicles and pay a lot for gasoline service etc  but if this ytb channel and everyone else lookalike were sincerelly objective and de facto independent from the car industry we would have witnessed a completely different or at least a more balanced presentation of these vehicles 
for example why dont we see proper comparisons and calculations with conventional vehicles of the same class andor price which in addition to always present battery range and acceleration to 100 kmh would also include top speeds waiting times for rechargingrefueling maybe expressed also in financial terms comparisons in speed averages how many evs do we see driving above 120 kmh on highways gasoline  electricity costs and most important price comparisons namely prices of evs are so excessive even if we take into account high price of batteries or savings compared to drivingowning conventional vehicles that up to eur 40000 evs are not very competitive and i did not take into account driving pleasures fast refueling times or cost of purchase and ownership divided on a longer period of time with conventional options fortunately despite the global pr media offensive we as users still have a freedom of choice and right now both mr robert and i in different parts of the world are enjoying themselves behind the steering wheel even if they are completely different",Peugeot e2008

2021-02-11,i stopped watching when you said the petrol versions were appalling the 3 cylinder 12 petrol engines in this car are brilliant the rest of the car is the same and i like the fact it isnt an electric car but a converted fossil fuel car why do people assume that because i want an electric car i want it to be obvious my e2008 gt premium is arriving on 1st march and i cant wait,Peugeot e2008

2020-12-22,id like to know how much it costs to charge one of these things when i fill my 2010 honda crv which will be my last ice car it costs about 55 good for about 450 miles or so the financial angle is important to a lot of people,Peugeot e2008
2020-12-22,"okay heres a quick breakdown of how much 450 miles can cost in an electric car
if the car does around 4 miles to the kilowatt hour the peugeot e2008 would manage that for 9 months of the year in the uk and you charge at night on an off peak tariff i pay 5p per kwh overnight then its going to cost just over a penny a mile
450 miles would be in the 5550 range
if you charge on daytime tariff say 15p per kwh that would cost about 1650 for 450 miles
if you only used rapid chargers 24p per kwh then it would set you back about 28 for 450 miles
then the most expensive electricity you can buy is from ionity chargers they are very fast and they charge 69p per kwh
this means 450 miles would cost 77 so yes it is possible to pay more for electricity than it is for fuel
but one final point if you get an ionity card then you only pay 8 per charging session regardless of how much electricity you consume so clearly youd only use an ionity touch to pay charger and pay 69p per kwh in an emergency",Peugeot e2008

2020-12-21,i feel that all the comments dissing the range over and over is a bit of an icehangover as well i think way too much emphasis is put on fast charging and range  essentially comparing to the ice experience on road trips some people might drive far often but most dont why not focus on how the car does for urban everyday driving and shoot in a note on what to expect on long trips this car has enough range to handle everyday urban driving for almost everybody and the reasonably fast charging makes the occasional long trip quite ok after having a tesla model 3 for 3 months we used superching for one trip i think its time to stop downplaying midrange evs from a resourceperspective and in a world where electric cars are battery starved these cars should not be downplayed like this,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-29,i have an e208 and i think i know the reason why robert has been getting less predicted range if i have been driving my e208 on the highway it would need a few days for the range to readjust to the lower consumption of city driving the range estumation doesnt change rapidly when you go from high to low consumption and i think this was intentional  so your range prediction doesnt change rapidly up and down all the time and stress you mind you i use abrp to plan my trips so i dont really care about shown range  cheers,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-27,this looks like a very biased review i totally disagree with his comments on the look of the car i dont want an electric car that says im electric to the contrary i want a goodlooking car that is as normal as can be as for range he may have had a faulty model most people mention 180 miles of range under normal circumstances,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-26,i have ordered a gt line my daily commute to and from work is 28 miles and weekend around 40 to 45 miles each day on a very busy weekend so realistic iam looking at around 220 miles a week so a month around 880 miles if i only get 150 miles out of a full charge which i think is a bit low looking at all the evidence thats just under 6 full charges a month my electric supplier after 1230am till 0400am charges 005p per kwh this means less then 20 a month i honestly cant remember when i last went on holiday in this country i live 2 miles from manchester airport and the last 30 years use this for my travel needs if i cant plug a car in 6 times a month on my drive and set it via the app to start charging at 0030 in the morning there is something seriously wrong with me and i shouldnt be allowed to drive on public roads if the average driver takes time and thinks about their average distance spent in their cars each month they will soon realise that the obsession with range is just something everyone else seems obsessed with and the average person could easily live with any electric vehicle,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-22,so far a lot of electric suvs instead of compactsedan cars,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-22,"im not sure what robert is complaining about when he says it looks like an ice car and not something designed from the ground up as electric exactly what is it missing that it should have or conversely what has it got that it shouldnt  in relation to ice vs ev

this is not the first time this complaint has been made and i dont understand it what are the designers missing that is apparently so important

i can only conclude that the use of regular instruments and gauges in the position accepted by all except tesla as the best location ie in front of the driver is what causes robert to complain he is a tesla owner and it appears to make him think any car with information display in the traditional location ie in front of the driver is dated i know he had a model s but now a model 3 which he loves and i think leads him to mistakenly believes that all evs should now have an ipod stuck on the middle of the dash and nothing else with which to control the car

in fact the reason why most cars have their info display in front of the driver is because ergonomically its the best place i know you can get used to turning your head to see the tesla ipod but that is not as convenient as simply dropping your eyes thats why every manufacturer designs their cars that way except tesla as the last 100 years of auto design have concluded that in front of the driver is indeed the best place then tesla come along and have to be different and being more computer oriented than car manufacturer they mistakenly think one big single touch screen display in the middle of the dash is a cool idea no its not its a stupid place to have everything and touch screens are a nightmare to use while driving especially on a rough road

i dont hate tesla at all and admire them greatly but their choice of information display and control system as it is on everything bar the model s is dumb and the main reason i would not buy one

it all reminds me of the company that has probably influenced user interface design more than any other at least in this millennium  apple in the early days of the mac they wanted to encourage good software and ui design from their fledgeling developer community and published a book titled human interface guidelines to assist developers and ensure a coherent design for all mac software in this book i read the immortal phrase that i have never forgotten

consistency should be valued above idiosyncratic cleverness

in trying to be different and hence inconsistent with all other ui design of incar information displays tesla have displayed an appalling tendency for what i would actually term idiosyncratic stupidity being different is not a good thing when what you have made different is worse than what went before

but to return to the original point id be interested to hear what robert does think makes the peugeot too much like an ice car",Peugeot e2008
2020-11-22,"it is dangerous to compare energy efficiencies between petrol and electric without taking in consideration the total chain of energy transformation from primary to final product whats in your electrical car battery is the almost final product as you have the efficiency of the engine to consider as well whilst for petrol the engine efficiency is pretty poor 25 to 35  depending on the technology

for the electricity used you need to consider how it was produced transported and stored which is complex as the electricity you store in your batteries could be generated from many different sources  gas coal nuclear hydro wind solar

for petrol or diesel you have to consider the efficiency in its extraction transport and refining

i guess what would be more important to consider is the primary source of the electricity generation the losses in its transport and storage

also something that is not mentioned enough is the weight of cars in general which is not helped by the heavy batteries needed for long ranges the heavier the car the less energy efficient it will be",Peugeot e2008
2020-11-22,if kona and eniro compact suvs can do 280 miles of range easily why are we constantly seeing new compact suvs that dont get anywhere near this i know not everyone needs this but surely it could be an option on all compact suvs i find a lot of new electric vehicles are content just to be somewhere in the ballpark they dont even want to compete this market is still disappointing me to me there should be 4 or 5 cars at least coming out each year that should be tempting me away from my current electric car kia eniro  nothing holding a candle to it in the same price range currently  still love watching though,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-22,hate to say this but based on the comments isnt this review very inaccurate according to existing owners mileage is much better than he claims trip computer is available there can be a reverse camera and interior led is dimmable and he starts by saying the car isnt attractive when i and pretty much every other reviewer think it looks great he didnt really talk to the steering or interior practicality maybe they think theres enough of that on other channels but then what value are they adding with this review and its inaccurate information not trying to be needlessly critical  and i happen to have test drove peugeot cars and concluded they looked nicer than they drive  but felt this was a poor review,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-20,not to concerned about the range as it seems average for the price of the car and fits most peoples needs and got me an ev for an affordable price and my fuel and servicing savings pays for the car  i had a bwm 4 series before and was expensive to run and this cars quality and interior finish and performance is just as good and i am very concerned about climate change and beside ev cars are better to drive a bit boxy though lol,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-20,"i think everything is ok with this car except 50kwh 50kwh is really not a lot for an suv it should have 75kwh or more
this is the massive downside when sharing a combustion engine based plattform
this is what vw does absolutely right
 they have a pure ev plattform
 they offer three different battery sizes and this gives them a huge advantage because in the sales statistic they see what people really buy and not just claim to would buy
with thee different battery options vw exactly knows from their sales statistics if they need to increase battery sizes or not listening to customers what battery size they really want by looking into the sales figures is the smartest thing that they can do
peugeot can not do this with offering one battery size which is stupid",Peugeot e2008

2020-11-20,you review cars from the stand point view of a country side person some of us are city people this car as way enough range for us you seem to be a big fan of tesla who in my humble opinion makes some of the worst assembling and quality interiors cars in the market a car is way more then a electric battery with high range sorry to disagree on what seems to be your view of what is a car by the way peugeot is today way closer to premium quality ps whats with the  it doesnt have a reverse camera  comment  that not accurate comment seems like a very anti french brands bias to me do you know any brand who would not offer that option today,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-19,"so you unplug it at 100 or 98 and the range showing is from the last figure you were getting so the car was just at 30 or 31  there is a trip meter   read the owners manual or just turn the left hand stalk and look through the options in front of your eyes
  strange the range some people say they can get at motorway speeds with the bigger psa models all using the same platforms especially the taller  heavier ones ton bigger wheels  tyres than say the ecorsa which is the lightest and lowest     are many owners driving alone with no luggage  the tyres over inflated",Peugeot e2008

2020-11-18,my theory with electric ones being the higher models is one of market people buying cheap cars live in flats or houses without driveways and garages  they cant charge an electric car and the public infrastructure while improving simply isnt there  sadly we are still slightly at the point in the uk where the ability to charge an electric car is a luxury especially one like this that would have managed maybe 2 days of my commute if i was a bit lucky  so either you spend an hour in a tesco car park 3 times a week or you buy a petrol the trim level is not the determining factor here  once this improves and it will do in both range and charging provision then boggo spec electrics will be vital  now i dont think theyd sell,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-17,as an e208 owner best car i have ever owned by a street i am a bit surprised by the quibbles you raise in this video noone uses nedc range peugeot themselves stress wltp and in my e208 it is clearly accurate i have driven 200 miles on one charge more than once ok it was during the summer the e2008 is only slightly less economical by all accounts and in recent tests both variants have exceeded the wltp figure ignore the gom  the software is too pessimistic and a software update is out there to fix it i dont see any link to the fossil fuel mentality though the bonnet on an e208 is smaller it is true agree it needs a reversing camera my gt has one surely there is a good argument for introducing an ev option into the range to make it seem less of a leap to drivers not fully signed up to the ev revolution the id3 is a great car  but the egolf seems to appeal more to many drivers because they are used to the way it looks,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,yes it sure is a nice car but despite that i would not drive it for the simple reason because they also make a petrol version of it that really is a bummer in these times you should make a statement that you drive an ev and not an ice car renault is doing a better job with the zoe,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-17,"about the transition car stuff i have to disagree with you the consumer has to transition to electric as well so i think its good that it still feels familiar to them

2020-11-18,the pricetag for is not transitioning however thats a shame,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-18,"honestly making a transition car in any case is a bad move evs are interesting because they are not bound to the internals of ice so interior shapes and exterior shapes can be drastically different which makes them feel interesting and new from a new ev i at least expect 500 km range and 150kw charging so far only a small portion of evs managed this

many evs made in 2020 were there mainly for regulations lets face it otherwise they would have waited a year with way more range and charge speeds this includes id3 4 and also the 208 and 2008 especially horrible evs like the hondae and mazda mx30 show that these are just statement cars not actually viable cars made for everyday use",Peugeot e2008

2021-02-01,cyans i disagree many are not interesting they are just ugly many car enthusiasts detest the johnny 5 design mentality that seems to prevail with evs too we want a car that looks like a proper car but uses electric as the power source transition cars are a great idea particularly if they get people like me to buy them they sell well and help steer designers away from the novelty toy designs they are churning out because if all i had to choose from was id3 or model 3 type cars with their revolting interior ui design i  would have to be dragged away from my ice cars kicking and screaming,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-17,"i think youre incorrect when you say you can see and hate the way this car was clearly designed to have petrol and diesel engines and electric only as effectively an afterthought

it has clearly been stated by the psa group that these new models 208 2008 c4 corsa etc were designed to be built on the same production line irrelevant of power train and manufacture doesnt need to change irrelevant of demand for petrol diesel or electric therefore if demand was towards 100 electric they would simply build them like that

for the costs of electric vehicles to come down to an acceptable and affordable level for the majority of users platforms and bodystyles will need to be shared plus there are still a lot of people that dont wish to shout about the fact theyre driving electric and wish to come across holier than thou as you are increasingly doing on your reviews",Peugeot e2008

2020-11-17,i love how every ev reviewer feels that they speak for 99 of people when they say 200 miles of range is plenty  i have over 300 miles of range and i can live with it but i would welcome 200 more in a heartbeat  i realize that i dont speak for 99 of people but i do commonly see others with the same opinion  i also realize there is currently a dimishing return on battery size so there is still a practical size limit  im sure as energy density increases over the years the average range will too  ill bet in 10 years 200 mi range will be considered tiny,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,it is based on statistics about how people use their cars it could well be that people who have to drive a lot like sales people care more about cars and therefore are more active on car centric social media,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,"john as mentioned that 99 is all about statistics these cars are aimed at average users rather than the top 1

if we use usa data as it has higher average mileage than any other country so is basically the worse case scenario usa drivers do around 13500 miles per year on average or 260 miles a week thats  about 37 miles per day on average in the us assuming they drove 7 days a week so even if someone did 5 times us average each day that would still be under 200 miles a day and again this is the worse case country

other countries do much less mileage on average the uk for example does 7400 miles per year on average and has been gradually dropping for the last 30 years it used to be around 12000 a year germany is slightly higher than the uk at 7800  so that works out at about 22 miles per day on average for germany most other countries in europe do less mileage than germany japan is even less at under 6000 miles per year so under 17 miles per day on average less than half the us average

so when an ev reviewer says 200 miles is plenty for most people thats literally what they mean its plenty for most people in the world based on actual statistics

also bear in mind many of these cars are being produced by european and japanese companies for the european and japanese markets

there will always be outliers of course and even for an average user there will be days when the car isnt used and then other days when they do a longer than normal trip",Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,theboothy666 i still dont think averages dont tell the whole story  if they did people would be happy to have 5 gallon gas tanks in their cars  maybe someday when there are level 2 chargers at every parking spot and dc fast chargers at every highway off ramp then batteries could be smaller  until then ill take as much range as they can practically squeeze into my car,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,johnh8268 do you charge at home if i did i could live with a very short range ev like a first gen leaf  it wouldnt be nice occasionally   a car with 150 miles though would make range an issue only on holidays and driving holidays are not that common for me   a car with a huge battery would be capital sitting around doing nothing  perhaps as much as the cost of redecorating the house which would give me more value,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,timmurphy5541 i have a nonstandard use case  i work in two different locations that are about 250 miles apart and travel between them weekly  i only have a home charger at one location  i rely on supercharging for travel between locations and while at the second location,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,"johnh8268 i agree to an extent i think we do need many more fast chargers than we have now and personally id be uncomfortable with an ev with less than say real world 250 miles range minimum
but i think the 5 gallon tank is a little different with an ice you always have to go to a station to fill up which would be a pain if you needed to do that every day
with evs most people although not all of course  would charge them at home overnight and would only use 3rd party chargers if they were traveling beyond the cars range
with an ev  youve basically got a full tank every time you set off from home
 some people only have on street parking for example so an ev might not be good for them currently especially for a high mileage user",Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,johnh8268 ah just noticed your post so seems youre basically one of the 1 i can see why a good charging network is important in your use case nice to see youre actually having a go with an ev even though you are definitely not an average user ,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-17,"the text with consumption figures in wh per mile or km are messed up at 440 it states 290 wh per mile and 466 wh per km but since a mile is longer than a kilometer this makes no sense i assume you accidentally did the conversion the wrong way round ie converted 290 miles to 466 km assuming the 290 wh per mile figure is correct it would translate to 180 wh per km which sounds about right this is the second time ive noticed this error in a fully charged ev review

2020-11-17,"lets be honest here this suv screams compromise in term of battery efficiency and range the only great feat of the platform it is sitting on is the heat pump even tesla has to play catch up on that  now and the inverter that sustain 100kw dc charging speed it is a car that will be marketed for families and in todays ev world and the lack of 3rd party charging stations im sorry but i will not use this car to go on vacation or to visit relatives living 2hrs away

2020-11-17,totally agree with the mpg bit we should always covert to mpg to show the efficiency of evs also and importantly when comparing the co2 emissions we should always include electricity used for refining petrol if people include the generation of electricity when looking at evs co2 emissions then the same should be done for petrol and diesel,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-17,i dont care what you say 150 miles range is enough owns and drives a 200 plus mile tesla if you are a 1 car family the longer the range the better we do not have a reliable enough rapid charger infrastructure to validate such commentary also faster charge rates require more cells in parallel the current physical limitations can not be dreamed away you want a small battery ev by an electric motorcycle its time to put up or  leave it be i own one they are a lot of fun to ride make sure to do so safely and dress for the slide not the ride,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,it depends doesnt it im in a one car family and 150 miles range would suit me perfectly if i had a driveway to charge on i dont commute to work so my mileage is not very high  im really more concerned by having enough space inside and initial purchase price,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,hi robert just wanted to point out youve got the trim level logic backwards batteries are still expensive therefore having evs only on high trim levels gives them a larger margin to absorb that cost the tech you get on a high trim level isnt worth 10 grand its almost all margin the seat mii electric which starts from 19k used to be around 10k when it had a petrol option,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,how can manufacturers justify 9000 for the battery,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,recumbentrocks2929 thats a question for them to answer since i dont have any inside knowledge of the costs incurred or their margin for warranty repairs etc looking across the industry evs are roughly 710k more than a base model petrol version also there were reports that the electric miiupcitigo triplets were being priced at a 5k loss in order to mitigate eu fines,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-17,28k although for some reason it seems to be more like 32k on the peugeot website for the base 35k for the gt line  compared to 20590 for the petrol one dont think theyll be selling many of these on cost alone youve really got to want to have the electric one knowing your break even point is going to be beyond 50000 miles away also i think its a pretty dirty trick to make the electric one appear cheaper per month by whacking on a 10k extra deposit over the petrol ones to get the monthly payments to look sensible,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-17,its the same car as the petroldiesel version thats why is still has a huge front,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,so first if we take the consumption and translate that to mpg it is massively more efficient than a combustion engine car then you get 130 miles instead of 260 miles from the car so effectively you simply actually dont get that very efficient car you blabbed about ca a minute before halving the range im not sure what i should take away from that blabla really ,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,no its still efficient you need to look up what the word efficient means its basically like the battery has a gallon of petrol equivalent of energy but gets very high mpg,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,timscott3027 depends very very much on whether that mpg equivalent was taken from its official numbers or actual numbers now doesnt it im aware that generally an electric motor is more efficient than a combustion one mr impolite mcteachy but the text of this video went really really crazy with throwing around numbers halving others later on and being unclear on whats what about the first statement if you dont see that i guess you dont see that,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-17,i think even city cars need 150 miles range in winter driving after that it is just nice to have   the weight of the battery is the same full or empty so there is a point where the huge battery becomes an efficiency drag along with much longer charger wait times  i get the feeling car manufacturers and the general non ev public are still stuck in the petrol station mentality where you only charge  fill up   once  twice a month so the battery needs to replicate that   in reality a charger needs to be where the car is parked up for a length of time  so you graze charge not gorge charge,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-17,my thought exactly this is why i stopped to comment obviously as the rest of us he did not divided 1000 at 290 but rather made some math tricks and messed something  my trick was that 290 is almost 300 so multiplied by 3 will be almost 900 though the result is 3 plus something there is no need for a full second to think that  so when he finished his two seconds aaaaboooouut and said four i knew that down here somebody already complained about his math skills ,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-20,_rafiki expect if you drive around town in eco mode can get close to the official figures the norwegian fellow was driving at high speeds 75mph on the motorways and his tests showed 198 kmh or 124 miles so what to expect from a 216 mile range vehicle at motorway speeds assume on d and eco and down hill your would put some charge back into the battery,Peugeot e2008

2021-01-10,tomlf8hx i am not quite sure what you compute but it looks like you talk about range i think that you missed that efficiency is about how much energy you put in for distance and for efficiency there is need to cut losses in friction at gas cars since gas was cheap this aspect was minor but for evs even electrons are even cheaper because storage is not so efficient as that in gas hence range problems efficiency in friction losses was important plus that known low efficiency of burning the gas in engine,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-17,muppet keeper data about electrical energy consumption varies from rafinery to rafinery in my country i can access data from the biggest oil company there but these are from 2014 then i found that for 1000 liters they use about 1mwh to even 4mwh of electrical energy that mean it is from 1 to 4 kwh per liter and that translates to 4785  1514 kwh per us gallon,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,i agree with that just one refinery uses as much electricity as a small city the size of coventry to sustain production factor that into a gallon of fuel and evs are even more efficient,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-18,edwyncorteen1527 you got it yes it just pisses me off when people say gasoline is an inefficient energy source bringing up the energy use for refining but completely disregarding the energy contained in the fuel itself renewables also contain free energy however the degree varies wildly depending on type the electric motor is highly efficient saying the whole energy path making your wheels pin on you ev is too is disregarding the obvious,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-18,muppetkeeper you are mixing up efficiency with environmental impact hydrocarbons are the highest concentrated energy ressource we know of hence the reason it has dominated a wind turbine is only 60 efficient in ideal conditions more like 20 average the rest of the wind energy is just wasted hydro is a lot better though,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-18,tore_lund youre absolutely correct about petrol energy density  thats why its been such a good convenient fuel for the last 100 years  the problem is that an ice in a car can only make use of between 20 and 35 of that energy  the remaining energy is just wasted  its very inefficient,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-18,benj5386 my objection was some claiming that evs overall are more efficient without regarding that electricity is much more energy demamnding to produce not that evs are not better but from a strictly physics perspective more energy is wasted getting the wheels to turn that energy might come from a wind turbine so virtually free and with very little footprint but the wind energy passing through the turbines blades is magnitudes greater than what is possible to recover however had we something else than batteries to store electrons and a natural process to harvest them things would look very different 100ah worth of colmb potential is only 02mg in electrons in orher words 18g of electrons is enough for a lifetime of driving an ev,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-18,tore_lund you are mixing up efficiency with the need for efficiency efficiency is only important if the fuel you are using is scarce and none renewable it doesnt matter if a wind turbine only takes 20 of the force from the wind the wind isnt going to run out wind turbines are designed to keep themselves safe and functional therefore the dont want the full force of the wind  hydro may be more efficient but the huge cost of building it doesnt make it economically efficient,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-19,tore_lund this is simply false renewables like solar pv  wind turbine even after considering energy to build the system is far more efficent than even gasoline without considering refining and drilling bevs simply consumes less energy and renewables methods of capturing energy is much more cleaner then add to the fact bevs have crazy good life span which should do 400000 miles which many fake studies are ignoring energy density of hydrocarbons is pointless it has no effect on efficiency sure wind turbines are only 60 efficient because they over generate in the wrong times thus they have to be braked when the grid can not consume the generation but you are wasting wind blowing not freaking fuel your entire argument is logicaly broken wasting the fuel is not the same as wasting wind blowing,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-19,tore_lund sorry nothing you said had functional understanding of physics just throwing terms and numbers does not inform how the system works i actually went into the mechanism and reasoning of what happens thanks for the swiftboating,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-19,neojhun then efficiency is the wrong word to use fossil fuels also has been concentrated by time as each barrel represents 4 times its mass in broken down biomass in other words  this is energy from before humans existed and no renewable source can reach back in time to collect energy from the past like that you could ofcourse argue that this is a highly inefficient process too as biomass is only capable of capturing a fraction of a percent of the sun energy used but the energy supplied by the human effort to get it is much less,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-19,tore_lund wtf but the energy consumed is less from wind turbine or solar pv capture to spinning wheels is still multiple times higher ratio for electric supply chain while biomass fossil fuels has a much small ratio from capture to spinning wheels you are trying to argue the sheer nominal amount of energy is more which make no sense you can not consume that much energy in an ev again your argument is logically broken ratio vs sheer amount,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-19,neojhun a solar panel takes on average 4 years to give back the energy spent on its manufacture if we then presume a 25 years life it is capable of supplying four times more energy than it has consumed a barrel of oil takes 4 of its energy to become gasoline adding another 5 for infrastructure and gas stations and geopolitical tensions it is still massively more efficient than solar  energy efficiency of an ev is a pointless argument the point is that the energy used has less co2 emissions and the higher efficiency of an ev itself adds to that but still overall efficiency of energy into revolutions of tyres is worse than using oil nb ive just ordered another 10w polycrystaline panel for my dashboard for 20 quid for that money i could have bought 20l of gasoline containing 180kwh of which a car could deliver 36kwh in mechanical energy the 10w panel will produce 10w6hours36525 years 547kwh in ideal conditions on my lattitude however it has taken 100 kwh to make it mining refining crystal growing slicing and doping and finally encapsulation so per pound paid it will give around 10 times more energy however this panel is horisontal and behind a windshield so more like only 5 times that of gasoline so in total i will get like 20 more energy per pound paid if i deduct the 100kwh used on manufacture however the reason it is worth while is because my dc converter has only 60 efficiency at low load which typically happens with daytime driving where only the inverter coolant pump and ecu is powered that draws 260w from my main pack but adding my first 10w panel reduced the consumption by 24w so in reality solar is worth more and cheaper than wall outlet power in an ev ie an efficiency gain,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-19,tore_lund 4 years out of 25 years that maybe is a sign of the ratio wtf thats 4  5  is current human generation ontop of the energy required in biomass to create fuel sure if your argument is the 9 of human generation gains 91 more energy from burning it thats more efficient but you just ignored the entire point burning fuel,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-19,neojhun i did not ignore the point of not burning fuel but that is not the issue here we are discussing efficiency that means energy out  energy in nothing else,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-19,"tore_lund 
the best ice has an efficiency of around 40  when not idling  you lose the efficiency argument just by the fact that an ice wastes at least 60 of the energy

it appears that you are unable to assess information correctly and believe that petrol or diesel simply appears in a fuel tank by magic  no surveying drilling pumping transport of oil refining transport of fuel pumping into the fuel tank involved  then the raw material isnt renewable on any sensible timeframe and has a sideeffect of overheating our planet",Peugeot e2008
2020-11-19,boggisthecat i presumed 20 ice efficiency which is lower than nedec specs for most cars personally my last car was 245 engine efficiency on paper but in real life my summer average was no better than 22 considering 2 gearbox losses so 20 is quite reasonable if cars had 40 efficient engines drivetrain theyd be almost twice as efficient as solar panels,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-19,"tore_lund 
ice typically fall around 10 to 13 overall efficiency  there are losses at every step in the processing of the fuel before the engine is involved  40 is a maximum engine efficiency not typical

battery ev is around 70 overall efficiency and rising  around 10 losses internal to the vehicle mostly conversion losses from ac to dc and back with the rest being generation losses  this is if using a non fossilfuel source  a poor coalfired power plant will only be about 55 efficient at producing electricity so your overall efficiency would drop to somewhere around 35 to 40 if using such a source

worstcase scenario gives battery ev at least three times the overall efficiency and this could range up to seven times",Peugeot e2008
2020-11-19,kehlerames218 that is very nice but not what is discussed here,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-19,boggisthecat a tesla model 3 is 72 efficient presuming whatever mix of parking and ac used in the epa test if you go over the numbers at 60 mph a model 3 uses 17kw to maintain speed measured from the socket but requires 14kw in mechanical power 3kw is lost however an engined car needs typically  only 12kw to maintain 60 mph because it weighs half as much and rolling resistance is still 3040 of losses at that speed and is burning 45 l gasoline per hour ie 4736kw in heat input so in numbers a tesla is slightly better than twice as fuel efficient than a regular car not 5 or more times more efficient as you claim,Peugeot e2008
2021-01-29,cbflazaro no that is not what im doing here i agree that the engine itself has only 25 efficiency but gasoline is energy concentrated by nature so it contains 20 times more energy than it takes to pull it out of the ground and refine it that is why compared by how much human effort it takes is far less energy demanding than other energy surces you can argue that electricity is not even a resource it has to be manufactured which is much harder than liquid fuel made over millions of years just for the taking so overall efficiency for a gasoline powered car if you include the free energy content of oil is 200400 even when the engine itself is only 25  an electric car can on paper never exceed 100 efficiency with perfect motor battery and wheelbearings energy will always be lost on the way to the vehicle,Peugeot e2008
2021-04-12,bdelphan a donkey oilpump lifts between 5 and 40l per stroke and it goes around what 10 times per minute so that is average one oil barrel per minute if it uses 9mwh per month as you say while it pumps 43 thousand barrels each barrel then uses 209kwh of electricity or around 1 of the energy content of that oil it has just pumped even if a tesla can go 58 miles on that amount of energy a car can go further from the 120l of gasoline you get out of that barrel so it is very efficient refining takes 5kwh energy not only electricity but also heat because the waste heat from distillation is used to pre heat the next batch of oil going into the refraction tower distribution and advertising and gas stations is another 58 losses so overall the oil industry produces more energy than it consumes this is the reason it has been king for a century because it contains free energy made by geology and that is something hard to beat at the bottomline however as oil reserves become more costly to extract and solar and wind is getting cheaper this balance is shifting but oil has had an obvious advantage by being concentrated energy just for the taking we want to get rid of oil but not because it is inefficient and we are transtioning to cleaner sources that are less efficient because we need to reduce emissions drastically but oil has always been the fuel with less effort per kwh at the wheels of vehicles,Peugeot e2008
2021-04-12,bdelphan my counter argument is still right too 9000kwh is still 43 thousand barrels capable of propelling a gasoline car for 33 million miles or half that if were talking a big car only getting  32mpg so the fact that an electric motor is 4 times more efficient than a combustion engine is in itself remarkable but it is the whole chain of energy use vs return that has made gasoline the obvious choice if we are going to talk about electricity production it also  has its own set of connected losses and has not been concentrated to dig up over millions of years we like electric cars because they are 1 cheaper to drive i use half of what i spent on gasoline just paying list price  tax at home 2 they have fewer emissions and if you drive a lot it is not an insignificant reduction of your household emissions  to get an ev 3 you can make your own fuel legally if you got solar 4 maintennance is rudimentary and is mostly the easy diy stuff like brakes and wheelbearings and new viperblades so from that perspective it is the better vehicle but it requires more manproduced energy per mile  driven than a gasoline car that cheats by borrowing from nature,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-17,its 2020 a reversing camera would be mandatory in every vehicle even the base model of the cheepest option i can purchase reversing camera kits for less the au40 im sure the manufacturers can get them for less than 5 as they all have screens already in their cars so i think the point is that its a very poor decision to not put one in and shows that they arent serious about making a modern car and are stuck in the past with old technology and old ways of thinking ,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,"kurtpalmer3674 its not the manufacturers being stuck in the past its just marketing they need things to distinguish between trim levels and encourage punters to spend more money  
i agree that reversing cameras should probably mandatory nowadays given how compromised rear visibility is on modern cars",Peugeot e2008

2020-11-17,"like if range is important to you  share if you think car makers should make evs from the ground up

the peugeot e2008 certainly looks the part but how does it compare to the other compact suv electric cars on the market its beautifully made and easy to drive but for a car with a usable battery of 45kwh you might expect a better real world range than this offers the inside is comfortable and it has a decent boot but it lacks a reversing camera and has some quirky internal lights that look flashy but are a bit distracting the e2008 is a decent effort but in an increasingly crowded market for compact suvs does it do enough you tell us

2020-11-17,"as a peugeot salesman im confused as to the spec you have been given the allure does not have a camera but the gt line should have you dont have to go to gt to get a camera

looking at the model you have it is a gt line with options it has not got the alcantara interior but it does have the panoramic roof

real life range should be about 180 from personal experience in town but maybe a lot less on motorways also peugeot marketing has been using the wltp of 190200 not the nedc

the ambient lights colour can be changed and also lowered or turned off completely

there is a button on the end of the wiper stalk to show you your trips including mile per kwh 

love the vids and i would love to answer any questions you might have as someone who is actually dealing with these models on a daily basis its a shame that it just arrived and a peugeot rep didnt run through some of the controls and features with you things like the trip meter is something i would have shown you within the showroom let alone when you actually drive the car",Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,1818joe thanks for that response joe and i cannot tell you the frustration level of knowing how to view the trip meter gggnnnn it is also part of the problem of not having the car for longer and also not doing enough research my fail but all that aside i genuinely loved the car,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-18,lean factor reallly,Peugeot e2008
2020-12-10,i love fully charged and the channel has been a big support  in helping me buy my first ev however this is sloppy journalism as most of roberts complaints about the e2008 are just factually wrong as robert has now admitted he didnt do his research properly or bother to work out the controls on the car therefore this is a bit harsh on peugeot and i do feel fully charged need to correct or redo this video but accurately and fairly this time,Peugeot e2008
2021-03-01,"hi bobby i think its worth reminding people watching on these reviews that the cars built on the same platforms as ice cars are always less efficient than native evs eg leaf teslas zoe and hence youre going to pay the same price for whats a manufacturers first attempt also which is more energyhungry and prolongs the manufacture of the combined iceev platforms as you could be paying for a fully sorted ev 

if sustainability and efficiency is the goal i think theres enough choice on the market now to push people towards the native evs over retrofit evs like this much like fully charged used to encourage people to simply buy bevs over hybrids and rangeextenders  from a long suffering ev and battery engineer",Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,weird that you got such rubbish range bjorn got 120 miles at 70 mph on the motorway and nearly 190 miles normal driving maybe youve got a duff one his also had the odometer displayed so it is there,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,isnt it just possbile that the previous reporter just constantly floored the car so it calculates the range on an average of the previous kms it has driven as he mentiones in the video,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-17,arnevanhove yes that would explain the low guessometer reading on the dash but robert went on to say that he had run it until empty charged it and it only covered 130 miles obviously this isnt a scientific test of the range all other reviewers seem to say 180 miles is easily acheivable,Peugeot e2008

2020-11-24,another expensive electric shopping cart how can you actually go anywhere in these things without wasting hours charging the thing,Peugeot e2008
2020-11-25,080 charge in 30 mins at a rapid charger with a worst case range of 120 miles  youd need to be doing a lot of miles on a regular basis to have to spend hours charging it  high power charging stations are popping up all the time  if range is too low then id3 or kia eniro are better  lots of options out there and taking a decent break every 23 hours of driving is probably a sensible thing to do,Peugeot e2008

2024-05-16,its worth noting that the final units of the peugeot e2008 went on a runout sale of just 39990 however this was after i filmed this review for that price you have a very competitive and upmarket electric suv that id pick out of most evs at that price point but at its orginal sale price of 59990 i felt it was not providing the value that other evs offered at that price range additionally i wouldnt want to be an owner who bought one at the original price as their car just depreciated like a stone after that offer was announced  cameron,Peugeot e2008
2024-06-10,olá cameron      gostei muito da sua apresentação    vc sabe informar a data em que ocorreu o lançamento do e2008 na austrália      vc sabe informar também em que mês e ano ele foi oferecido por us 39990     desde já lhe agradeço pela atenção  ,Peugeot e2008

2024-05-20,the cruise control stalk being hidden is surely troublesome but if you own a peugeot it will take you about 3 minutes to learn and after 2 or 3 rides its definitely not a problem since youll have it instinctively memorized i would say this is mostly a reviewers problem not a problem for anyone meaning to actually drive this car same thing with the small steering wheel and position of the gauge above it thanks for a very good review,Peugeot e2008

2024-05-12,oh thats not my opinion its based off data from owners from our site productreviewcomau who review cars theyve bought and lived with not to say you cant get a reliable motor but there seems to be a general sentiment they can have some issues,Peugeot e2008
2024-05-11,"maybe a disclaimer shouldve been added to this story guys peugeot australia inchcape actually discounted the price of this vehicle on monday 6th may 2024 by 25000aud making it 40000aud drive away and in 4 days they sold their entire 2024 stock they now have no stock until the facelifted e2008 arrives at the beginning of 2025

now as for full bev only vehicles look if you have solar with battery backup then its fine as a metrourbancbd run about if you rely on grid power with no solar then your wasting your time yes its cheaper than a petrol powered vehicle but no where near as covenant and then you have to factor in external recharging which is not cheap at all in relative terms either",Peugeot e2008
2023-09-06,i used to like peugeot vehicles and owned 2 many years ago the problem with an ev based on an ice vehicle is that it really isnt a purpose built ev and i do think the alternatives you suggest are better options without a doubt the mg4 is a purpose built ev as is the byd atto i agree with your views on the peugeot dashboard i like it and the car looks well finished if i wanted one id wait for the updated model,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-06,thanks greg,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-06,this has a great design but the fundamentals such as price value range and fast charging rates mark it as an also ran,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-06,you make a strong argument there,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-06,the ev concept has failed i believe that at this stage car manufacturers are just trying to push out the door all their products before the general public know about it,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-06,you are completely wrong,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-06,"absolutely especially here in aus consumers and manufacturers have realised the greenest solution are the hybrid offerings the purchase price is also an inhibiting factor in australia or any country for that matter that doesnt offer rebates or tax incentives

it will take around 10yrs of usage and feedback in the market before the issues really start appearing the shortfalls are already apparent in environmental impact battery longevity and replacement cost the insurance and crash repair costs battery safety and lack of battery recycling in australia are becoming apparent

i believe japans lack of interest in evs chinas enormous wastelands of sold but unused evs and vw groups incredible scale back of ev production are signs of the the failing ev segment 

evs were deployed by unscrupulous companies to make profit from the to be short lived ev market before its impending replacement with hydrogen",Peugeot e2008
2023-09-04,always wondered but with ice vehicles theres a lot of discussion on reliability eg toyota is pretty reliable jaguar isnt how is reliability measured for evs they no longer have all those parts anymore aside from stuff like cabin quality does this mean all electric vehicles are on the same reliability footing,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-06,its honestly something thats on my mind a lot too i find myself more confident in the reliability of these european brands when it comes to evs how thatll actually pan out in the long term i guess we can only wait and see,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-06,rexthesheep the only thing that separates an ev from an icev is the mechanical aspect of the driveline  that is the long block engine portion and the ratiochanging portion of the transmission everything else is  for arguments sak the same  so you remove that aspect and any reliablity issues associated with it and replace it with an electric motorinverter unitand a single speed transmission all things being equal youd expect the electric driveline to certainly be significantly more reliable mechanically but not infallible due to its simplicity but potentially a bit less reliable electrically due the complex and high power inverter that is absent in an ice  the net outcome i would say is a higher level of reliability overall for an ev    but still the same old situation for every other aspect of the car that causes people problems and frustrations and this will happen for as long as manufacturers cut corners in engineering both mechanically electrically and electromechanically  including material specification  and for as long as variations in quality control at the manufacturing level exist ,Peugeot e2008
2023-09-06,"rexthesheepvery good question however the european brands are known for their electronic gremlins and failures so i dont understand why you would feel more comfortable with a euro brand

also based on your question if an ev could effectively last 1 million km with just minor mechanical parts replacement such as wheel bearings suspension pads etc and having its battery replaced every 200000km think thats being abit generous but for argument sake is that reliable

i mean the battery is a consumable at huge cost and what life expectancy and what if the manufacturer ceases to supportupdate the vehicles systems preventing its intended operation with updated infrastructure",Peugeot e2008

2023-10-02,"when talking about ev range i would like to hear more specifics about how the car was driven motorways cold weather or wet roads will cause the consumption to increase alot sports normal or eco mode matters less than the weather conditions and how efficient you drive

a 140 miles 228 km range would mean a 21 kw100km or 3mikw consumption on average the only time i have seen that kind of consumption is driving uphill in coldrainy weather there are no motorways where i live so top speeds are usually between 4555mph

i saw a norwegian winter test where the mokka e was driven in slushy snow 0 to 10c and still managed a 165 mile 260km range in a summer vs winter range loss comparison the mokka e was only beaten by the tesla model 3 the mokka managed 324 km 202 miles in the summer test which is almost bang on compared to the official wltp range all the evs in those tests are driven in the most eco friendly mode under the most ideal conditions during summer and no high speed motorway testing

have had my mokka e for a month now and my average consumption after 1100km is 165 kw100km roughly 37 mikw this would give me roughly 175 miles of range this is in normal or sports mode only by the way the temperatures have been anywhere between 8  20c lots of rainy and wet conditions the car definitely does not like wet conditions not many cars do and this is where i have seen the highest consumption so far

goes without saying that since the car is brand new i have been idling alot as well as testing the acceleration 060 handling through corners and whatnot would have seen a lower average consumption if i had driven it in more dry weather conditions and without all the new car testing

i have also seen crazy low consumption when commuting to and from work the consumption has been as low as 135 kw100km 45 mikw this was during mild and dry weather conditions of course with those numbers i would get closer to 215 miles on one charge

regen vs coasting efficiency
the cons of the mokka e so far is that it only has d mode or b mode in d mode it regenerates slightly so you cannot get a full coast mode like you can in the egolf or other evs for downhill it is not so bad but i notice that driving uphillhilly roads or flat roads i keep having to throttle somewhat to maintain speed 

because it lacks the option to turn off the regen in d mode it then becomes less efficient than it could have been and i can imagine this only get worse on motorways any ev that lets you coast also lets you maintain speed for some distance without even touching the throttle andor you only need short bursts on the throttle to keep the momentum going

in other words when driving on flat roads or hilly roads it feels like the mokka e is constantly trying to slow down whatever speed i built up if the mokka e had the ability to coast i would probably get 230 miles during the summer

in summary if you drive alot of motorways then you should be less concerned with the official wltp range and look at the size of the battery instead as well as the drive modes of the ev to get a minimum of 200 miles on one charge you would atleast want a 6070 kwh battery size",Vauxhall Mokka
2024-02-02,agree i have a e2008 since october 2020 i tested it on eco normal and sport i drive the same and get the same mileage usually 200 in summer without anything else on all the modes do is allow that extra power on a lighter foot it just depends how much you trust your heavy foot lol,Vauxhall Mokka
2023-08-09,i absolutely detest my mokka e and cannot wait for the lease to end i have had lots of issues with charging  primarily 2 times when i have had to have it in the dealerships services department for w months out of 18 months of the lease every time it takes 23 weeks before an ev engineer to look at it  currently it is back in the service department after its 3rd breakdown where it wont take a ccs charger the car wont communicate with the chargers guess it will be another system update bit doesnt help when doing motorway driving and you dont know when the system update will need to be done again  if i could give it back i would right away  another 6 months of stressing every time i get to a ccs charger to see if it will or wont charge,Vauxhall Mokka

2022-10-22,bought my e almost a year ago and apart from that i love itdespite the fact that it has spent over a month in the dealership for various issues the most important of those is the noisy front suspension knocks rattles and more some have been cured or minimised by replacing brake caliper mountings antiroll bar bushes and at the moment driveshafts well have to see when i get it back its a pity that vauxhalls answer is that theyre traits of the car and that because its electric youll hear more at 70mph poor excuse for lack of suspension development in my opinion,Vauxhall Mokka
2022-10-11,i hate the small glovebox and lack of rear interior light plus the boot top cover is ignoring because you cant find a space to put it if you want to make the boot bigger other than that i do love this car,Vauxhall Mokka

2022-08-05,"ive had my mokkae sri nav premium for almost 6 months now im averaging out 39  40 mikwh and frequently travel from oxford to southampton  portsmouth

basically whenever i travel to portsmouth i pop the car into eco mode just to preserve the range and usually have to give it a little top up at one of three lidl stores on the way back through enough time for a bite to eat i can do southampton and back on a single charge with approximately 20 left in the battery

motorway efficiency does drop off a cliff but i find that dropping to either 65mph or 60mph does help  yes it may take an additional 1020 minutes to arrive but its a small trade off
my biggest gripes are the rear space  boot capacity being a new father its a bit difficult getting the child seat  pushchair in

otherwise in terms of design im not a big lover of the piano black features  an absolute magnet for grubby fingerprints and the boot button being above the number plate which is just bonkers to me and only adds to the aforementioned grubby mitts problem

on the whole however its a great piece of kit and im looking forward to see what vauxhall can do with the rest of the range id recommend the car to anyone looking at evs at the moment",Vauxhall Mokka
2022-08-23,why dont you use the key fob to open the boot,Vauxhall Mokka
2022-08-23,"i do as a rule however its still a poorly thought out design feature ive also noticed it doesnt seem to open the boot whilst your in the car with the motor on say when im doing my click n collect shop  although ive not tried to unlock the doors first so perhaps that will do it

2022-06-07,the mokka is one of the worst electric cars out there i could test drive it for an hour and returned it after 20 minutes that says it all no fun to drive at all,Vauxhall Mokka
2022-06-06,for a small car those miles per kilowatt hour not kilowatt figures are terrible sooner rather than later ev consumers are going to realise just how important efficiency is it affects range it affects charging times it affects cost to run and own the niro is bigger better more powerful longer range and more efficient the model 3 is much bigger and on par with the niro for efficiency i look at the mokka and cannot work out why it is so inefficient,Vauxhall Mokka
2022-06-08,from what i have read and listened to its efficiency is similar to that of the hyundai ionic so it cant be that bad,Vauxhall Mokka

2022-06-01,we have a mokka e and love how it looks and drives  however two problems that we have noticed with it are 1 it refuses to allow a home smart charger to control the charging  the car itself has a delay charging facility built in which is the only way to control the charging to automatically start after midnight on a cheap tariff  2 there is no equivalent facility to automatically stop charging before it reaches 100  therefore you either have to physically stop the charging manually or allow it to charge to 100 every time which apparently isnt good for the battery  batteries degrade more quickly if they are frequently charged up to 100 apparently operating within the 2080 state of charge range is more advisable to look after the battery,Vauxhall Mokka
2022-11-14,that always to 100 is a showstopper for me thank you for saving me into looking at that car kona it is then for me,Vauxhall Mokka
2023-01-21,i have had the same issue regarding the charger schedule not charging the car its a pain as you say that you cannot end the charging period using the car you can only start it ive tried two different chargers to find one that will allow me to schedule a charge but the mokka e refuses to be charged by either vauxhall need to get their act together,Vauxhall Mokka
2023-01-21,antonissavvidis1534 this is a bit of a play on words the useable capacity of the mokka battery and all other electric vehicles is less than 100 to prevent you draining it or charging it to max as both are bad for the battery all evs have a system in place that protects the ev from over charging and over draining,Vauxhall Mokka
2023-01-22,philthompson665 since buying our vauxhall mokkae a year ago ive been charging it using the deferred charging schedule facility built into the car because it appeared that the car stubbornly refused to let our indra v4 charger control the charging  indeed a response to an email that i sent to vauxhall querying this issue stated that they could not change or set up their cars to allow smart chargers to control the charging  however just this last week in discussions with the installers of my indra v4 charger chargedev i have discovered two things  1 a compatibility mode called relaxed overcurrent can be set on our charger which prevents the car from going completely to sleep when it is plugged in and locked which basically means that the deferred charging schedule facility built into the car is not required and the charging of the car can indeed be controlled by the indra v4 smart charger yippee  2 recent changes to the software of the charger and the smartphone app for the indra v4 smart charger allow for much greater control of the charging including the ability to stop charging and also the ability to lock the charger when not in use to prevent electricity theft which in present times with sky rocketing electricity prices may become a thing but hope not  hope this helps someone  ,Vauxhall Mokka
2023-12-19,i have a wallbox and can control the charging via android app and can stop the charging the opel app no need to go for the car to stop charging,Vauxhall Mokka
2024-01-16,to be honest charging to 100  and battery health is overrated weve still driving an egolf 2016 and always charged up to 100  even used super charging a lot after 8 years and over 200 000 km there is not much loss on battery health think the battery will live longer than the car ,Vauxhall Mokka
2022-06-01,we love our mokka it suits us perfectly and looks great yes the range isnt great terrible on motorways but my partner can do his 60 mile round trip commute for 2 days and comfortably have over 25 remaining it is very comfy very quiet and very smooth the elevated driving position is great too absolutely no issues with the infortainment and phone connections the one flaw is the lane assist as others have said it can be very annoying its too strong and forceful when it kicks in and sometimes gets confused with other slight marks in the road but overall we love it,Vauxhall Mokka
2024-07-02,i dont know if its because i drive a bmw m5 competiton but my god the mokka is uncomfortable the suspension feels like you are driving a bouncy castle,Vauxhall Mokka

2022-05-26,the rear space issue is caused entirely by being designed to also take a conventional motor resulting in bonnet being too long reducing interior space the only fix is a proper ev only design id3 for the win,Vauxhall Mokka

2022-10-11,"no thats not the reason its based on the ds3 not the peugeot 2008 which means  short wheelbase  the reason is to keep the weight downto improve the range more space and size means more weight and therefore worse characteristics

then the bodywork is constructed by peugeot  however not designed it is two different things  which has not made a spacious car in 30 years it gives for example a very poor opening angle on the rear doors",Vauxhall Mokka

2022-05-25,"my findings are 
1yes the lane assist is worth turning off especially when its heavey rain or the motorway lane has building works it was steering towards the cones 
2if the boot board is not clipped on the back window wiper wont function you could easily take it into the garage because of this
3i set up auto connect to my phone and it asks me to connect everytime 
4auto setting on windscreen wipers dont kick in untill you cant see out of them completely  when u turn them on manually its too fast the slow setting",Vauxhall Mokka
2022-05-24,"yes i can relate to the infotainment issues random bluetooth disconnection from phone lane assist issues on narrow and unmarked roads 
i have to turn the lane assist off so it doesnt jerk the steering wheel which is annoying
the two front windows dont wind all the way down sometimes they do sometimes they dont 
car not opening with key fob tried both fobs and only way to get in was to take the key out the fob and open the passenger door by key then the fob starts working again 
the footwell vent when selected blows loud but not with a lot of force this is because its not switching off from the windscreen so my dash cam overheats and switches off you can select other vents etc but footwell only not a chance 
my feet were cold on my morning work journey in winter
the left circle on the dash with the ecobraking totally disappears and is replace with an amber warning light that looks like a charging cable wrapped around a pole apparently there is a recall on this 
the download yourself to usb updates that you then have to take and put on the car is a complete backwards step considering these cars are the future plus my car just kept saying error so it had to go in for it doing customer care had to agree to pay for it too despite the warranty you are warned of diagnostic fees if they cant find anything wrong 
my car is currently in for a second time in regards to the above i have had it 7 months 5000 miles and had no issues in the beginning now there seems to be all sorts cropping up 
there are no specific car seat covers as yet same with the usual accessories still waiting 
the rear seating area is cramped for adults and even more so if the front passengers need their seats further back there is no lighting in the back or air vents however there are two usb ports so i have put a couple of those led usb lights in there to help boot space is limited but i have downsized from a bmw x1 
if anyone asks me advice on electric vehicles i recommend  them to wait as there will be better designed cars with longer battery life being produced and for less  in some ways i regret changing cars the price of fuel v and ev costs about 2 to charge overnight maybe 34 times a week yes it is cheaper with ice you dont have to worry about filling up and going longer distances 
the ev aspect is more charger availability anxiety rather than range if you cant park in the right bay for ev charging the cable wont reach if you get an emergency during the night or have to travel unexpectedly the paranoia of this has you trying to keep the car topped up  
i had an emergency hospital visit and was low on charge there were two chargers at the hospital that i could have used but both spaces were iced the hospital was no help in getting the cars moved or contacting the drivers",Vauxhall Mokka

2022-10-11,"its based on the ds3 not the peugeot 2008 which means  short wheelbase  the reason is to keep the weight downto improve the range more space and size means more weight and therefore worse characteristics 

then the bodywork is constructed by peugeot  however not designed it is two different things  which has not made a spacious car in 30 years it gives for example a very poor opening angle on the rear doors",Vauxhall Mokka

2022-05-22,hi lane control thing really isnt a big deal as u can turn it off by holding down a single button for 2 seconds great on country roads personally ive found the lane keep assist great on motorways and major roads theres enough space in the back for 2 big kids normal under 6ft adults which for me is perfect as 95 of my driving is on my own or maybe a single passenger seats steering wheel and screens are the best layout ive seen compared to leaf id3 kona ioniq the driver screen is customizable so u get exactly what u want in front of u and actually it was the only one that has a big display showing battery level so another big winner something that doesnt get mentioned much but i found it the best for road sound insulation as well ,Vauxhall Mokka

2022-05-16,i get what you say good point  miles per kwh is what all evs say on the instrument cluster mine has a 64kwh battery and dose on average 455 miles per kwh this is the way the motor industry has chosen to relate efficiency to battery capacity so the customer can have an mpg type analogy as an aside 3 miles per kwh for a small car with a 50kwh battery pack is a bit rubbish,Vauxhall Mokka

2021-09-05,not entirely true  the equivalent cost wise has the smaller battery from memory 35kwh  vs mokka 50kwh  to get the 64kwh battery in the kona is 2k more than the mokka  i know this because both were on my shortlist,Vauxhall Mokka

2021-02-09,somewhat pathetic having to purchase a three pin charging cable,Vauxhall Mokka
2021-02-09,the thought here is that most people buying an electric car like this will have a home wallbox installed and those that dont have access to offstreet parking will use public chargers which either use a mode 3 cable or a ccs connector in reality a threepin cable takes such a long time to charge an electric car that very few will top up in this way,Vauxhall Mokka
2021-02-09,drivingelectric i understand that but this type of ev is aimed at the budget end of the market where people new to evs might not be so organised,Vauxhall Mokka

2021-02-09,out of all of them i would point out citroën as the comfy one ds seems more like a design  luxury car peugeot is definitely rubbing luxury and design but in a sporty way and i would say opel is the practical one,Vauxhall Mokka
2021-02-09,opel the budget one,Vauxhall Mokka
2021-02-09,"nathan150 nicely pointed out the citroen does seem to try to be affordable too
its actually kinda difficult to point out the arrangement unlike land rover and their 3 model family that blends the same aspects but prioritizes one over others in each family the ex psa brands are kinda competing",Vauxhall Mokka
2021-02-09,as we mentioned in the video the citroen is indeed the comfortable one the peugeot is more practical and the ds a little bit more luxurious the vauxhall is a curious mix of the three,Vauxhall Mokka

2022-06-12,some other things i think people need to know as an owner so we have had a petrol automatic mokka for 12 months so the lane control is a pain getting in the back is another issue so kids will be ok but if your an adult you will have issues getting in and out we have the keyless entry we have given up on this as it is so temperamental then one big issue is when we go to open the car with the key fob we find the car will not open the key fob stops working so we have a trick now to get round this we have to open and close the boot which i am guessing because we have keyless entry it allows us to do this then the key fob comes back to life we can now open the car with the key fob the car has been back 7 times to the dealer still not fixed i have seen on other reviews other people have the same issues so i guess goes across the electric and petrol models,Vauxhall Mokka

2022-01-31,i love that green colour but not the price yet another ev thats still far too expensive for a lot of drivers in the uk its time that car manufacturers started producing inexpensive evs for the uk market if citroën can come up with the ami and dacia the spring surely someone can come up with some sort of an actual  electric car for around 15k for the uk market,Vauxhall Mokka

2022-03-20,kerry9741  over the years petrol and diesel cars have got more and more luxurious and of course prices have risen accordingly some people dont particularly want or wish to pay for an all singing all dancing car myself and a lot of other people purely want a car to get them from a to b and dont care about all the fancy gadgets etc im not materialistic and most certainly do not flash off my wealth when i buy a car home clothes etc the same goes for electric carsthe majority of manufacturers are producing electric cars with all the gadgetshence the high price which automatically excludes a lot of motorists from going electric there is a market for no frills electric cars but most manufacturers are hell bent on continuing to produce all singing all dancing electric cars,Vauxhall Mokka

yes it is affordable if you personally can afford it

2022-01-24,this mokka is a crossover not an suv as you say at 210 it shares its mechanical components with the corsa supermini  subcompact vauxhall marketing department is making a mistake calling crossovers suvs that brings ridicule from suv drivers and puts off buyers looking for a crossover,Vauxhall Mokka

2024-07-07,"i have said it before around yt and ill say it again here no motoring journalist should ever mention the 12 puretech engine without an enormous caviat got it in my 2016 peugeot 308 sw ii and as many other owners of cars with this engine ive experienced massive issues with this engine the timing belt dissolves itself over time cause peugeot uses the brilliant solution of having it run thru oil the valves stick open on some cars when you floor it for overtaking turbos have issues on certain cars it drinks oil like nothing ive ever experienced and that is just some examples of issues with the engine oh and yes this engine eats spark plugs btw one must change them every other year or theyre likely too burn out wich happend too me while on a long journey wich was great fun 

the whole exchaust rusted too pieces after just 55 years they keyless function on the driver door is well known for giving in on many stellantis models

and another amazing bit of engineering is that almost all of the alarms on everything from the windshield washer fluid to servere engine problems has the same sound so after having had 45 engine failures as ive experienced theres nothing like hearing the same alarm go when your out of washer fluid

i lost so much money on my car and with stellantis cars depreciating like crazy and all the issues i personally have experienced i simply cant afford too get rid of it either im massively up side down on the morgage and have spent an insane amount on repairs as it is

oh and yes one more love nugget almost every time ive complained to the dealership where i live i get the lovely response yeah thats a well known problem with these cars but your guarantee has expired so that will cost you so and so

i just write all this because im simply amazed how much praise this engine have gotten but rarely if all theres any mention of the massive amount of issues with it",Vauxhall Mokka
2024-07-07,im sorry about your experience but have to question whether these problems still persist on pure tech engines even wet belt ones after about 2018 psa changed the belt material several times and this engine turns up in so many stellantis models i wonder why we dont hear of more failures ive run a peugeot 208 september 2020  manufacture for over three years and the belt looks fine you can see a section through the oil filler it uses no oil and the spark plugs have lasted its low mileage but then the doomsters say its short journeys that kill it on the negative side the stopstart system hardly ever operates what im sure of is that you have to use exactly the right standard and grade of oil,Vauxhall Mokka
2024-07-15,piglet5287you bet they are still happening and on mass my 71 plate crossland is in the dealership as i write this message along with countless others mokka and grand land and the warranty wont cover it unless your basically taken in on the back of a break down truck its so annoying ive got to pay for this because i spotted rotten belt before the engine died  take a look on the vauxhall forums its terrible how many people are affected the worse one was a 24 plate crossland 4000 miles check engine light belt all cracked and falling apart  they need exposing for this its a nightmareoh and you mentioned the correct oil needs to be used lots of these people have stuck to the service intervals and so had the correct oil and still they are failing its just a stupid ridiculous design rubber and oil any oil dont go well together its the fact when standing one part of belt is in oil the other dries out i think as well that cant help,Vauxhall Mokka
2024-07-15,"at least 4 engine failures in 8 years im so sorry youve had this experience

one source ive found helpful over the years is honest john who have been good at pointing out known faults on used models i couldnt seem to find a mention of the issues you experienced on their what to watch out for 308 sw page though

as of 4 july at least in the uk all new electric peugeot models sold are covered for up to 8 years under their new allure care scheme as long as the car is serviced at a peugeot dealer every 2 years this looks very similar to toyota relax that has been in place for a few years now

unfortunately peugeots new scheme only seems to cover new electric cars and as much as i like them electric cars seem to be depreciating even worse than most ice models at the moment to the tune of the renault zoe selling brand new for 30k and used for 15k just 1 year later so im not too sure what to suggest for your situation other than if it were me having such an experience with the reliability of your 308 would have massively knocked my confidence in peugeot",Vauxhall Mokka

2023-09-11,"great review thank you i think the mokkae represents an easy transition to bev driving  the persistence of the plethora of buttons is welcoming to some traditional ice drivers as well as the conservative but stylish looks 

i can see the appeal even though a spreadsheet might suggest an alternate choice 

styling alone is the only rationale for choosing a ds3 etense the mokkae encouragingly has other good attributes",Vauxhall Mokka

2022-06-19,so we have had a petrol automatic mokka for 12 months so the lane control is a pain getting in the back is another issue so kids will be ok but if your an adult you will have issues getting in and out we have the keyless entry we have given up on this as it is so temperamental then one big issue is when we go to open the car with the key fob we find the car will not open the key fob stops working so we have a trick now to get round this we have to open and close the boot which i am guessing because we have keyless entry it allows us to do this then the key fob comes back to life we can now open the car with the key fob the car has been back 7 times to the dealer still not fixed oh vauxhall customer service is a waste of time i will not say what i think of them,Vauxhall Mokka

2021-07-19,"at the moment im stuck between the vauxhall mokkae the citroen ec4 and the peugeot e2008 the ec4 and e2008 both seem to outclass the mokka but from my knowledge citroen and peugeot have a history of unreliability when it comes to mechanical issues that is however a history and doesnt mean that theyre new electric models will suffer from the same unreliability do you have any opinions about this

also great video very well spoken all the useful bits of information and some really great points about some of the down sides such as visibility and the rear doors ill definitely be checking out your videos for the ec4 and the e2008",Vauxhall Mokka
2021-07-20,"cant comment there as its hard to test for reliability however all the vehicles you mentioned come from the same motoring group  some built even on the same vehicle platform groupe psa now known as stellantis so wouldnt associate one or the other especially as you said with the electric power train

and thank you glad you liked the video comments such as these are very much appreciated
do let us know what you make of the other two subjectively the ec4 is the best out of the bunch  purely because of its comfortable seats",Vauxhall Mokka
2021-09-10,from the statistics available it seems that the french manufacturers nowadays are more reliable than the german but maybe less than the asian i have owned five different peugeot currently a 3008 and have not had any major problems with any of them the 3008 is now 4 years old and over 70 000 kilometers on the odometer have not had a single fault,Vauxhall Mokka

2021-07-19,"good reviewi looked at the mokka before deciding to buy the kia soul ev
reasons being i just felt vauxhall have let themselves down here by offering a car that although i quite liked from a looksdesign point of view simply doesntfor the moneyprovide enough range or performance
im finding my soul ev will easily offer 250m of range and with over 200hp on tap its actually a fairly quick car too with plenty of confidence inspiring instant torque   
i was looking for a positive first experience to driving electric and the soul certainly provides thatits a great well thought out vehiclethank you kia",Vauxhall Mokka

2024-01-24,"your review is complete miss i just had it as a rental in some medium trim and the only thing this car is good for is roll it down the cliff it is made for looks only and thats where everything ends it is unpractical uncomfortable not nearly decent to drive loud and with pointless body shape small suv
it had the same 3 cylinder 12 turbo engine that sounds as tractor fuel consumption is super high for this engine size 9l100km this one was automatic and i drove it moderately in general these 3 cylinder turbo engines are overly stressed and i dont believe they will live more than 150k km before some more serious problems this translates to resell value of practically giving it away for free
then there is hard plastic all around and even with 16k km on the clock some parts are already rattling then ridiculously wide door footstep that you have to go over to get in the car infotainment despite the physical buttons is the most stupid unit i used it even cant remember that you were listening bt last time you drove so each time it switches to radio when you start the car
oh yes the start button it is the most unresponsive start button ever you have to hold it for a second or more so that it figures out you want to turn on or off the car
back seat is far more worse than described in this video rear windows come half way down even though they are tiny hard plastic everywhere even on doors elbow support  you really have to crawl in on the rear seat and then you feel like in the dungeon no light in rear bench 
rear camera image on the screen is horrible 
suspension is hard and unforgiving very loud and shakes entire chassis even on the smallest pothole steering wheel is disconnected from the feeling of driving driving display is just huge display with not so much useful info
ac controls are mainly integrated into infotainment and very confusing
these suvs are becoming popular only because peoples vanity they are pointles for the fuel efficiency and practicality they are not capable of offroading horrible to drive on road and these downsized engines are not even remotely better than 4 cylinder in real life usage and their lifespan is much shorter but they are cheaper for the manufacturers",Vauxhall Mokka

2023-06-16,not commenting on the review just on the car which i picked up today  the important stuffdriving it is awful  if you drive it in normal mode it takes forever to pick up speed  in sport mode theres quite a lot between hitting the gas pedal and the car noticing this then its rushing and you have to hit the brakes this in city traffic  so getting through a junction  of roundabout is a nerve wracking expetience  the seat adjustments are limited making it uncomfortable  the car feels unstable the brakes dont give you any confidence  fortunately im only stuck with this for a couple of days and will thereafter absolutely avoid it,Vauxhall Mokka

2022-06-19,so we have had a petrol automatic mokka for 12 months so the lane control is a pain getting in the back is another issue so kids will be ok but if your an adult you will have issues getting in and out we have the keyless entry we have given up on this as it is so temperamental then one big issue is when we go to open the car with the key fob we find the car will not open the key fob stops working so we have a trick now to get round this we have to open and close the boot which i am guessing because we have keyless entry it allows us to do this then the key fob comes back to life we can now open the car with the key fob the car has been back 7 times to the dealer still not fixed,Vauxhall Mokka

out of all small suvs why would anybody buy mokka over 2008
it has less space for people and luggage
its cabin looks and feels worse

so why should anyone buy this car",Vauxhall Mokka
2021-02-15,the corsae point is valid  thats a significant saving for what is fundamentally the same car the id3 point i agree on less both good cars in very different ways and which one appeals to you more will depend on your personal preferences,Vauxhall Mokka

2021-02-06,is that suv small or are you just a giantlooks as low as a lamborghini when your stood next to it ,Vauxhall Mokka
2021-02-06,"so i just realized that we have this here in the us  the petrol variant  badged as a chevy trax and there is a buick variant  my neighbour has one 
they do strike me as a stupid design because the cabin looks tiny in relation to the size of the vehicle in terms of the four corners as an electric car the design makes more sense with the car being taller because it is sitting on a tray of batteries of course there is no electric option here

they have the bolt here and i am a little surprised that they havent brought out an suv based on the bolt chassis its a tall hatchback so it would just need a little dressing up to become a faux suv the cabin in the bolt  i just bought one  is woeful compared to the mokka it has the worst seats of any car i have owned and yet is the most expensive car i have owned albeit that i bought it used and for a very reasonable 15k still i love it overall

best vauxhall imho mark iii cavalier i had a 20 cd in the early 90s  a company car as was every other example and they were like a plague on the motorways of britain i could do an indicated 90 at 3000 rpm and it just ate up miles loved that car it did for ford at the time it was disparaged in general as the repmobile but there was a reason all the fleet buyers chose it",Vauxhall Mokka

2021-02-06,not sure everyone would agree with you on the tesla styling the model 3 in particular splits opinion and the model s is seen as very safe perhaps even dull in terms of its design  as you say  design is a matter of opinion,Vauxhall Mokka

2021-02-04,"i like it though i would have preferred more range
being that the mokkae corsae e208 e2008 ds3 etense is all the same car it makes sense from a production point of view theyre the same but not from a consumer choice point of view

2021-02-04,but if they went after that market itd be more expensive and they wouldnt sell nearly as many,Vauxhall Mokka
2021-02-04,"anonimushbosh to be fair its already up to 34k they need to at least offer an extended range version and with that will come an increase in performance too because of the larger battery
they say 201 mile rangein real world use that will be closer to 150 mileswhich is pretty dreadful
anyone whos thinking of paying 34k ought to save up and buy a 40k tesla  theyd have a real electric car then complete with an established charging infrastructure

2021-02-04,looks decent the only mildly eyebrow raising section was the price seemed a smidge expensive for a vauxhall so it will be interesting to see where it sits in relation to the competition i guess also being a vauxhall deals will be there to be had once the initial rush is over,Vauxhall Mokka
2021-02-07,evs are premium priced at the momsent because theyre relatively new tech to the market but like computers and digital cameras prices will ease the cost of lithium batteries has tumbled in the last 10 years and once more people buy into the technology then manufacturing costs come down but yes at the moment evs are pricey steve but the cost of running them is a lot less than a petrol or diesel car prior to getting my kia eniro i was forking out about 25 to 30 a week for fuel now its around 7 a week i charge at home on my drive using cheap rate through the night usually once every 8 or 9 days servicing costs are peanuts in comparison too as there are no oil changes no engine no cooling system no gearbox no clutch no exhaust etc,Vauxhall Mokka
2021-02-04,looks are ok not convinced about price  did you mention if there are model options  i think any decent respected and potentially influential review channel yes that includes you guys should be prepared to mention what actual range is achieved extrapolate if you have to and compare with other vehicles in respective price range maybe price per kwh  perhaps include what its like driving in town keep up the good work,Vauxhall Mokka

exterior is ok acceptable notsuperweird
interior looks good relatively simpleandtidy dashboard layout that round center display is not good though overstyled form that hurts functionality thats bad

lets hope the petrols arent such a cut priced marketing exercise

2024-05-10,i think for the price of this id much rather get a smart 1 as its the same price of the entry level mini with the level 1 pack and its much more practical i know it doesnt really have the appeal of the mini but i think its much better value for money,Mini Cooper
2024-05-10,it seem pretty pointless to me the rear is just plain ugly that circular screen is horrible the whole thing looks like its aimed at people who dont have a clue whats the point of a car where the priorities have been form over function but the form fails the mg4 is cheaper and much more practical and quite enjoyable to drive  and theyre both made in china,Mini Cooper

2024-05-09,"i agree with others the whole character of the mini has all but evaporated  i feel a little like since bmw were gifted the single valuable bit of rover group they wanted  jilting honda unpleasantly in the process  its like theyve gradually been processing what was a very natural organic product  here we are well over 2 decades on and its lost almost all its flavour  just imho  i mean who knows what honda would have done but this is literally a mini in name only  maybe that works for some people  i dont disparage electric cars in general not being a fan of changing gears when the car can do it for me they have a natural advantage to me  i only know this if evs were the norm since 1950 say to presentday nobody would be able to convince a boardroom to buy or drive an ice design  its inconceivable due to the environmental catastrophe alone  but noise invisible toxins etc etc thatd blow it out the water anyway  and that is with todays rather wimpish batteries  

breakthrough or not the batteries are slowly improving anyway  its where were headed i think the war is already over won  lost but during the transition i have no beef with other motive power units and dont think ordinary people ought to be punished financially for keeping their purchased vehicle for a decent length of time  i drive an old prius and previously did indeed scoff  i literally bought it based on just two main parameters one it cannot have the same lousy fragile automatic transmission all the other used cars i bought have  two i cannot afford enough battery power to make the car get really hot inside the cabin after a cold or wet winters walk in the hills  those two things swung the purchase  evs overcome the first also but are squarely a problem for the second because nothing is much better as a boiler than a diesel or petrolgas combustion engine  a great boiler is 93 efficient and any old ice is 80 efficient as a heat producer  we tend to forget only 20 gets anywhere near turning a shaft  take care all",Mini Cooper

2024-05-09,yes typical southerner p off,Mini Cooper
2024-05-09,good review but i hate the back and white thinking that low range  pathetic and high range  good there are plenty of us that dont need or want electric cars with bigger batteries and therefore more range its like reviewing a lamborghini and saying the interior is pathetic as it doesnt fit a family of 5 and 2 dogs id love to see more smaller electric cars with smaller batteries but with quicker charging if this new cooper se had a 30kw battery but charged at 150kw you could get 1080 in around 10mins that wouldnt be an issue for long trips if you ever take long trips if you only had to stop for 10 minutes every 2 hours think outside the box cheaper lighter smaller more efficient,Mini Cooper
2024-05-14,wait and see how many cooper es they sell,Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,bmw sold the i3 for 30000 in 2018 and now the mini cooper e will start at the same price in 2024 with a smaller battery,Mini Cooper
2024-05-10,yes and the bmw i3 had more space inside and had rear wheel drive so better traction and it was made from light strong carbon fibre and in 2018 it had a rex option so no range anxiety the i3 is better than this in every way,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,the engine sounds in timeless mode were recorded from a real vintage morris according to electrifying yt channel also new car shorter but wider cheers,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,minis are the ugliest cars on the roadelectric makes them twice as such,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,im normally very open to car designs most cars are rather unoffensive and i think most deisgns are fine but i really dont have postive vibes from the exterior normally i am indifferent but really just dont see the appeal of this deisgn looks soartificial,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,if we all refused to buy cars that insist on burying commonly needed functions in menus on a screen then they would be forced to rethink i have no idea why it isnt illegal to take your eyes off the road to mess about with a car screen just as it is illegal to look at a phone and rightly so,Mini Cooper
2024-05-14,if the voice recognition works well then it wont matter much when voice recognition doesnt work its really frustrating to not be able to safely change a setting,Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,i drove the new electric mini s last saturday in righthand drive form  i can confirm that the steering wheel and driving position were fine  nothing seemed out of line the model i drove was in jcw sport trim  grey with a red roof i loved it  it seemed very well built and didnt disappoint on the performance front it pulled very well and the gokart sounds made it seem very sporty yes the boot is small and the rear seat is only suitable for kids or adults on a short trip but im guessing you already know that and if that was a problem youd be looking at the countryman or someother brand,Mini Cooper
2024-05-31,have you compared the electric mini to the mini one do they feel the same way in terms of steering and suspension response,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,blimey this makes my 17 plate cooper s with chrome trim look like a rolls royce compared to this chinese thing,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,frankly these new minis dont have the mojo of the older ones the mini world for me ended with the r56 maybe at a pinch the f56 these new ones look exactly like the suzuki swift,Mini Cooper

2024-05-10,yes it is crazy you can get a tesla supercar for that price with more of everything,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,i like the clean cut exterior design it seems interior quality has taken a step back but i guess the f56 was exceptionally good the se range should be standard the e range is very disappointing given the steep price 41k in ireland for the classic trim base with the level 1 pack its a 45k premium over the equivalent 15 ice model,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,it doesnt look like a mini older model looked much better this looks like a suzuki swift,Mini Cooper
2024-06-10,spot on was just about to say the same  mini is no longer minilike,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,im most excited about a renault 5 and a mini cooper e comparison in the near future  its good that the  stupid acceleration noise can be switched off  promising but  the  e208 feels a better ev,Mini Cooper
2024-06-11,add the abarth 500e to that comparison,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,mini knows their client base isnt cross shopping another brand despite what youtube comments claim mini band loyalty is high,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,its not a mini its a front wheel drive bmw without diluting the bmw rear wheel drive brand ps its sub par as an ev,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,less mini and more ora 3 ,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,that looks horrific,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,i like how they want to pretend they are cool on the inside but in fact they are just cheap that central console armrest stuff looks like it cam straight out of a dacia sandero which costs half the price,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,chinese car at bmw price sounds amazing,Mini Cooper
2024-06-01,itll be a third of the price in 3 years on the used market especially with the chinese slashing prices as ev falls to ground for growth,Mini Cooper
2024-06-10,i wouldnt call 34500 cheap at all no one will pay that,Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,"good review with a few comments
1 why not even mention the glass roof seems like a plus
2 how often you going to have rear passengers just keep the seats folded down for extra storage
3 agree with hvac controls wish they were physical buttons
4 i wish you brits used  more realistic range testing no way that is getting 250 miles probably closer to 185mi",Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,but i think renault5 electric is cheaper and similar,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,well yes ive done 25000 miles in my electric car t m3  no problem,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,built in china so why is it now 3538k for an se total joke you van still buy a old style 15l petrol for 21k 15k cheaper,Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,just another ev shitbox ,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,yes i know the mini cooper is a bit of a luxury car but 34500 pounds means it will cost around 38000 euros why not buy the new model 3 at this point or even the volvo ex30 also the renault 5 looks more interesting imo,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,not everyone wants a tesla or suv renault r5 is an interesting choice though,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,it looks like a chinese copy of a mini which i suppose is what it is,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,"when i looked at it for the first few times i couldnt figure out why it felt odd then i saw it the bonet is just a conventional style instead of the clamshell design minis have had since the revival it just ruins the design for me as well as the flat headlights instead of round one the back doesnt look too bad but the front is awful the lack of blacked out wheel arches also looks odd
the interior is a huge step down the previous one was elegant with a touch of luxury while being unique it certainly looks unique now but also like a toy
bmw is having an identity crisis and they unfortunately transmitted the virus to mini",Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,decent review as mini never sell on being really practical but they are popular and hold their residual value charging speed is pretty irrelevant on a city car our ev is charged once or twice per week while we sleep,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,pity about the unnecessary door moulding should have kept the flat design of previous generations and updated cooper c,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,did you actually look at the tyres on that car  did you set the tyre pressures   last mini electrics come on crap tyres for anything other than warm dry roads  chosen to help the range    then they are often handed over with over inflated tyres and journalists seldom check or adjust the pressures,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,you actually got two options on the last car goodyear eagle f1s or khumo all weather the goodyears were an option,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,indeed on the 16 rims  but then the cars dealers had in stock in the uk level 3 sit on 17s with goodyear eagle f1 as did bmw media  press cars  i have 16 rims with maxxis ap3s fitted and no loss of range but superior grip dry wet cold snow or hot weather,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,left hand cars    very different when right hand drive and right handed people and the screen to left,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,that lovely leather steering wheel is not leather really is it  it was never the skin of an animal  mini were clear on no leather  fake   is that not in the media pack,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,great and honest review the f56 was a high point for the interior quality of the mini as you say in your review this is a cost cutting exercisemade in chinafor more moneyi meancome on  maybe your average car buyer will be wowed by the circular oled screen and naff sounds having owned every generation of new mini this is the first one ive skipped and just took delivery of a new 500e in my opinion a much better reinterpretation of its original design and made in italy where it should be made,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,wtf is this interior its hideous,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,"any chance of these things being affordable for the masses yet googles
no i didnt think so",Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,should have given it a sliding rear seat to give more boot space when 1 or 2 up,Mini Cooper

2024-05-27,yabeenbamboozled5067chinese manufacturing quality is better now but not as good as us uk japan korea weatern europe but better than some american small evs,Mini Cooper
2024-05-27,way too expensive but thats inflation for you,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,the first mini cooper s by bmw cost 16k in 2004 and the base line mini 12k how times have changed,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,looks great but the electric car side of things is pathetic whats the point of this poor charging speed bad range 5miles per 1kwh  hilarious and 35k what was the point shipping the manufacture to china if you still end up with this unappealing package,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,another load of junk when will they learn,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,i think mini are going to be loosing buyers why have they got rid of the soft plastics i think that dash board is going to be really shiny on sunny days i do think personally they have destroyed their line up the clubman was a great car why drop it ,Mini Cooper
2024-06-01,i agree theyve focussed on rich kids who need to be different and ignored loyal owners who are all commenting they wont buy one always been about chic now they try and be tesla then renault shows off its 5 etech and people say wow thats interesting then look at the mini  boring as a manilla folder so much so they have to add gimmicks to distract you,Mini Cooper
2024-06-01,kidfreejones i agree with you there the older model is far superior to this new model,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,do small electric cars hold onto their value,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,if you are buying to keep a car it hardly matters about residuals,Mini Cooper
2024-05-14,no electric car will keep its value because in 3 years time the new model will have substantially better range and tech that will slow down eventually but not soon,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,"i think this might be the worst looking mini ever looks like an own brand knock off of what was a premium small car crazy expensive especially considering the massive reduction in interior quality to save on costs and that touch screen how is it even legal to use icons that small while driving 

i was excited for this review because the upcoming aceman was on my shortlist for my next car but cant see that happening if its anything like this one",Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,cant understand why they got rid of the black wheel arch trims the front cheeks of the car look so bloated and chubby without it there,Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,the back triangular lights looks awful compared to the current gen mini,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,"umm
ive been a big mini fan  in the past 
but your statement about external looks hard to tell this from the old model id beg to disagree 
the volvolike blanking panel in the middle of the front grill is plain ugly and the flattened rearend is vanlike 
oh dear how sad  

time for an affordable city electric car from mini and other european manufacturers for noncompany car buyers",Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,"so the most popular mini electric will be 35k when most manufacturers albeit nonpremium are dropping to around 25k30k

2024-05-08,i seriously dont understand all the bewildering options level 1  3 bs why would you buy a semi premium car in base specification i just dont get why manufacturers dont just make it simple lets have 1 model  fleets  a separate model for the  ordinary consumers with everything loaded already if im paying 30000 for a car i want as many bells and whistles as possible for my 30k which is a big chunk of money,Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,"many years of experience with mini cars and as a cooper se 2023 owner heres my comments and proscons list
i will have to start with negatives because fairly they ruined the iconicretro design of their own throughout the 1980s and 1990s the british market received numerous special editions of the mini which shifted the car from a massmarket item into a fashionable icon because of the retro design understanding and since the day mini came out with new countryman and the new mini sse even the 2023 mini cooper se has the characteristic tounches everywhere exterior and interior keep reading down below 

my objective thoughts and proscons list 
pros
1 bigger battery had to be improved because even cars like peugeot 208e500e had bigger batteries than the previous generation mini cooper se 

2 the chassis is lengthened a longer chassis can provide more spacious interior and increases performance

3 growth of mirrors i think its counterdesign considering the iconic circular mirrors and iconic design language however for someone who is not very tall larger and rectangular mirrors can be considered functional as they can minimize blind spots

4 more options on customization the mini also great to see john cooper works exterior body kit so smooth

5 more horse power means better perfomance great to see

cons god im furious and dissapointed the are too many of them objectively
1 the black plastic artch trim has gone seriously those places especially if you live in cities will get tremendous amounts of small damages from other car doors and small physical contacts also where is the iconic design

2 the taillights what the hack you guys were thinking the physicalş design had never changed since 1990s and you guys not only changed the shape also abolished the union jack great britan flag and instead put a triangular cheap material chinese looking lights

3 interior the new generation automobile industry finds it right to express interior design in the most extreme way possible but if we look at the cars that have reached the timeless design language no matter what and what you will not come across such a disgraceful interior design the reason the reason is that everywhere inside is made of a single material and they are trying to look as if it is a brand like tesla no my friend this huge screen does not reflect the 1959 central speedo screen there may be people who like it but if everything is being completely electronic on a single screen including the air conditioning controls the car will be more antiuserfriendly and you will understand how useless it is after using it for a week also i dont think anyone has to like this stupidly designed futuristic steering wheel

4 interior buttons used to make you feel like youre in a spaceship or an airplane this swisting and onescreeneverything buttons are definitely less charismatic than previous minis more cheap material plastics being used and carpets everywhere making it like its only one piece carpet love to see and feels of the better quality materials on my cooper se i love them

i would be happier if i was able to see mini brand not being gay and try to shine wanting to be more popular not following the stupid path started by other brands if if if if mini used to be mini but not anymore it looks like it doesnt feel like it you also learn from your mistakes no simplicity  no good",Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,i dont really understand that comment  do they have to move the game on consolidate the brand  still seems very desirable if expensive,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,yes desirable and looks great however the battery hasnt improved compared to the peugeot for example and with chinese involvement it cheapens it,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,paulgardner560 it will be roughly the same range as the e2008  range is a bit of a misnomer in evs its the day to day efficiency that tells the story  chinese involvement doesnt cheapen it its the cost of producing evs and car companies greed to obtain more profit,Mini Cooper
2024-05-17,thejfg7741not sure that profit is a dirty word without it companies go bankrupt if someone prefers another brand then they can buy that and companies will have a choice to change their offering to encourage more sales simple capitalism in action,Mini Cooper
2024-05-17,silverghini2629 i agree  its capitalism in action thats the problem,Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,in the uk almost 1 in 5 new cars are electric you need a reality check,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,ewadge no theyre not its a fact that dealers are obliged to sell one electric car for every five cars sold so these get preregistered but rarely sold  manufacturers are stock piling electric cars because very few people are buying them  vw  for instance  have vastly cut production of electric cars because theyre selling so few  thats the reality check  dont be so naive,Mini Cooper

2024-07-27,few things wrong with it no combustion engine    bit of a pity and it looks like a souless ebox like all the rest of them  and the interior aesthetics looks a bit over simplisitic and you can tell its a bit fiddly  to use the big screen whilst driving which is a bit of a negative could also do with a very chrome highlights too bad they did away with that classy element  it should be interesting the sales for it when people are turnng their backs on ev cars in certain markets would i want it   nope,Mini Cooper

the mini has never been my cup of tea so i wouldnt buy one  i prefer the vw id3 over a mini renault megane mg4 or kia niro electric for instance

its all about personal choice  im not going to knock something that i do not prefer to own and equally i expect people to behave in a mature way and respect my choice

2024-07-20,"this is probably the most disappointing review i have ever seen on fc the sheer bias was astounding i have been in both new and old mini electrics

the original is faster  quote the official figures and lose all credibility lighter by over 240kg more efficient better handling better looking better made yet this car seems to have the sun shine out its missing tailpipe

the original will get better than wltp every day of the week that is 144 miles range personally range is the most overrated feature of any electric car

did you know that mini apparently had to ease up on the traction control because it was so good people thought the car was slow or under powered in reality it is faster than the new model

the aesthetics are terrible in my eye but i am biased so lets ignore that did you know the outgoing model has the same hud it isnt a new thing

so many in my mind hideously biased comments about the old car which is in every metric other than range better it was cheaper as well in oz it was the same price as the petrol with the same spec

i have been watching fc for many years and this is the first time i have been angry about a review the new mini isnt an improvement and in most cases worse please be honest otherwise it sounds like you have been paid to say things

for those wondering i have had an se for almost 4 years and have also tried the new se so i know what i am saying now i wish mini well and this car will no doubt attract a new audience but it is in no way an improvement

i apologise for being so direct but this really got me angry i thought more of fc",Mini Cooper

2024-07-17,"im a huge fan of instrument displays that are clear and consise what i mean is that if im looking for the speed or the navi or temperature controls they shouldnt blend together

if you are doing greater than 100kmhr in traffic you dont have time to fiddle here and fiddle there make 3 displays rather than 1 display to help preserve the safety for the driver

rather a disappointment to remove a physically shielded driver cluster showing speed distance warnings other essentials im not turning my head  to look at a central display that the passenger can play with that is a hazard

to be clear about heads up displays you can do a windshield projection and have a decent daylight visibility while it creates no clutter the little tinted glass where a proper clutter belongs is a failure honestly",Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,"brilliant would love to see more reporting on the expected average bundled model that if you need no package to have a good experience then they should be letting reviewers test that bare bones model

however if the car manufacturer means for you to subscribe to heated steering wheels or only have trail access to high beams the car manufacturer should say the base price is x  a yearly subscription for y before counting the cost general maintenance",Mini Cooper

2024-07-17,"have a few minis and an electric car i cant believe the price  range ratio awful if you could see some of the chinese evs being developed for more than half the price for more than twice the range i would definitely hold off

2024-07-17,"its good to see robert doing car reviews again but im afraid its a big miss for me and i think well be keeping our original 2020 mini electric rather than get the new one 
 the bodywork no longer really looks like a mini that rear end  and has horrible creases in it so that it looks like its had a prang at sometime plus the handles will be a haven for spiders 
 the interior looks really cheap especially the buttons and not worth the 30 grand price tag an increase of 6k on ours
 yes the screen is nice but the changing of modes is sooo slow 5secs  impractical and a backwards step from the 2020 model which is an instant change

i do agree wirh robert that the range is more than adequate weve had 120miles  15 battery left before now and a smaller battery just means quicker charging stops 

with the likes of the renault 5 fiat grande panda  hyundai inster to name but a few all coming out soon cheaper and going further on a charge i think mini will struggle to sell these ",Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,"this is pathetic while most of the europeans and american manufacturers keep churning ev at 30k  price the chinese are trying to get their prices to around 10k to 15k price you know affordable like the ones most people need to actually make a dent on climate change

lfp per kwh pricing in 2024 is set to drop to around 50 per kwh and end of last year was already below 100 180000 or 1400 for the pack and the other 28600 is for what a base model then add extras like a 13amp granny cable ccs cable adaptive led keyless entry folding mirrors heated seats auto high beam hud and you are sitting at 35k in the configurator

1 it looks like a mini good

2 the range really in 2024 on a groundup designed ev platform what were you thinking bmw  it may be enough in theory but theres an easeofuse easytolivewith issue here especially for those making the transition from ice 
3 the price  they just have to find a way of making a competitive offer  okay its iconic and thats a value thing but its also quite compromised with the range issue and interior space and terrible rear passenger access and there will be more alternatives from china with a much better value proposition

2024-07-17,"seems like bobbys main objection to the original minie was range for the price otherwise all of the adjectives he has used to describe the new minie can be applied to the old i disagree with his perspective that because the old minie was basically a petro conversion that that somehow delegitimized it as a good if not great ev

the first example he gave was the fit and finish was just so good  well the old minie had that too so next pleasure to drive  old minie had that as well head up display well had mini not copied tesla with a forward instrument cluster like the old minie the new minie would need not have to bother with a headup display center display mini heritage had been nononsense instrumentation  what does putting picture of kids dog or cat have to do with driving so most of the improvements imho were simply gimmicks that do not a great ev make

2024-07-16,i think its great that bmw are making cars with small batteries in the real world the vast majority of small car drivers simply dont drive very far on a regular basis  what actually matters when youve lived with an electric car for a bit is actually how fast and reliably it fast charges for those occasional long trips  ive driven a bmw i3 for 10 years and its absolute fine for non regular longer trips and the rest of the time its hilariously fun to drive 185 bhp 1250kg carbon tub rwd  the 95kw charging rate for the cooper se equates to adding nearly 400 miles in an hour so in the real world a huge proportion of trips are not going to be much of an inconvinence,Mini Cooper

150 miles of range for that money is useles to me i want to be able to travel the 300 odd miles to see my family with out the bother of having to stop and charge petrol and diesel is so much more convenient its why manufacturers should have gone for hydrogen fuel cell or hydrogen ice engines electric cars are useles without the charging infrastructure which away from cities is crap",Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,my jaguar xkr does 060 in half the time and it fits me so much better plus theres the whole leather wood and metal thingy i prefer so the mini electric is not for me but as a car for you its perfect ,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"feel like fc has been a little bit more forgiving on the ev overcharging  putting bigger batteries and more tech in the cars to keep them expensive situation recently good to hear robert calling it out hopefully this is the biggest topic on the news show and so on because it cant be allowed to go on any longer

as far as the car itself i like the design it reminds me a bit of a suzuki swift and thats one of my favourite designs especially with the yellow paint it really reminds me of it",Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,such a nice colour for a mini makes me sad seeing so many of these being bought in dull colours,Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,it looks like a cheap copy of a mini,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,not the most dignified rear seat entry robert,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,charming as always,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,a round screen is there are tons of drawbacks and no real benefits worth mention,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,looks like a great litte car however it will run into the exact same problem as the 500e that is no one would buy a 3 door city car that costs 30k,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,why didnt you reset the trip as opposed to banging on about how it was previously driven come on robert you need to do better than this,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,what are you whining on about ,Mini Cooper
2024-07-18,andymccabe6712 the lack of decent journalism,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,might try and get one of these used in the future love the style and size perfect for around town,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"the round screen in the classic mini was a speedometer the reason was because bmc needed to save money by not having to make a left and right hand drive dashboard
despite this the brilliant owners of the company were such geniuses that they lost money on every car they sold because they had not managed to grasp the concept of math and accounting",Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,still repeating the tired old stories ford put about to try and discredit the mini when they couldnt compete with it ps its maths,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,simonmatthews7512  i learned to drive in the classic mini learned automotive repair and maintenance and knew it enough that when my high school auto repair teacher had us draw a diagram of a cars ignition and starter circuit i drew the minis ignition and starter circuit instead of the one in our instruction books so no what i said about why the classic mini had a center mounted speedometer is pretty well known,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,hmmm i am struggling to see that this is a significantly better car than its predecessor given this is a ground up ev design and the advances in motor and battery design an increase of 4050 miles of range over its predecessor seems underwhelming the interior looks very budget in places and a big drop over previous generations it also seems bmw have failed to capitalise on the benefits of making it in china as its still comparatively expensive particularly when a few packs are optioned its the last point that is a deal breaker for me though  i want to buy an ev thats built locally not one that one that has to be transported half round the planet on a fuel oil burning ship before it even gets into the showroom nah its a pass from me,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,1300 the range will be impacted in the summer and winter an extra 50 miles of range wouldnt hurt its all trade offs i guess,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,trying to sound like a jetson hover car,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,i imagine engine sounds will one day be like ring tones on cell phones start your company now,Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,thanks bmw mini for adding back real buttons,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,cute car i know its a small car but that range is crap,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"tldr great car needed 100 miles more range next
come on bmw we know you can do it just do it",Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,221 thats a terrible set of stats on that display my 3 yr old e208 does about 4mpkwh at 30mph,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"base model mini cooper is 7k cheaper than the base ev  7k gets you roughly 5000 litres of petrol which will allow you to travel a distance of 51000 miles before you are at the price of the ev

so even if you charge it up on a mega low home tariff its still costing you more

ev manufacturers have to do better than this if they want the average uk car buyer to get a ev all the pro ev warriors already have a ev and its no wonder people arnt buying these",Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,actually that means it costs less if you drive it more than 51k miles so if you had it for 100k miles like many people do that is 7000 cheaper than the petrol version you did good math but the conclusion is off,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"oddjobsandrandomprojects nothe conclusion is only off if you own the car for a long time or you do astronomically high mileage both of which very few people are ever likely to do wth this car 
soo your conclusions are at least as off
the sad reality is that in most cases its its still a lot more expensive to own an evinsurance",Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,andymccabe6712 in the uk i hear the insurance is higher here in the us it is exactly the same i checked because i wouldnt buy one if it was higher i will be getting an ev for my next car i checked and it will be much cheaper for me than my old honda civic i wouldnt call 52k astronomical miles i see used evs regularly for sale with over 100k on them all my current cars have over 200k on them however they might not do that in a mini cooper,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,"oddjobsandrandomprojects people arent owning these long term its usually lease as they cant afford the upfront cost so unless its a 5 year plus ownership then its still more expensive to own

lets be honest we all know its more to insure and you still have to pay for the eclectic ether at home or public charging
why do people have to make up scenarios to prop up evs ",Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,nickthegriffin not a made up scenario just a fact ive checked and the insurance where i live is exactly the same the electric is way cheaper than petrol the people i know arent leasing they own them one owner cars im finding used have 100k miles on them you arent allowed that many miles on a lease sorry you are using a made up scenario to prop up petrol and why do you watch a channel if you arent interested,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,couldnt really care less about the range but then i do own a honda e,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,yellow car,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,hmmm 7k more expensive than the petrol model i guess bmw are still clinging to selling  their polluterwagons and sod the world,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,im sorry but that dash is so bland and boring and the exterior is horrendous i was so looking forward to the new mini,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,you think,Mini Cooper
2024-07-18,andymccabe6712 could you care to elaborate on this,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,for 150 miles of range it should cost under 20k not 38k,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,yes for me anything less than 200 miles real world is a city car  fine but dont expect to take it on a long journey in real life with 150 miles you are going to be stopping about every 100 miles which is only about an hour and a half of motorway driving i  like to think i average 2 hours between stops on a longer journey,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,i get around 220km  140miles in my 2020 mini  not motorway  on average the new one  not motorway not that type of car me thinks anyway should make 200,Mini Cooper
2024-07-18,i mean it should definitely be cheaper than it is but virtually no car is less than 20k these days,Mini Cooper
2024-07-18,"its 28k which is still too much you could get a 300 mile range cupra born with under 10k miles on it for that much

hell you could get a tesla model 3 or polestar 2 with less than 20k miles on them for that much",Mini Cooper
2024-07-18,smitabhmoitra5726 yeah but why would you have a tesla,Mini Cooper
2024-07-18,melanierhiannahighly efficient class leading in fact very fast long range great infotainment system,Mini Cooper
2024-07-20,its not minibmws fault its the tories  when you give your manufacturers no government support to reduce their labour energy or supply chain costs this is what happens its amazing they even still bother to make it in the uk china where the fake mg is made is a different story entirely,Mini Cooper
2024-07-21,150 miles is enough for 95 of driving tf you mean,Mini Cooper
2024-07-21,andyjdhurley its also the difference between paying for public charging or doing it all at home i regularly drive to a satellite office 100 miles away with my polestar 2 i can get there and back on a charge and charging at home is 7pkwh with this i would have to stop and use a public charger a rapid is at least 50pkwh often much more,Mini Cooper
2024-07-22,yes but this is a mini rollsroyce at least in spirit,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,the looks suzuki swift 20,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,still not quite appealing over petrol due to price and range and apparentlyelectric cars are the reason all our insurance has doubled,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,it is criminal to ask or pay more then 20000 for such a thing,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,what a horrible hooooooorrible looking car,Mini Cooper

who dont care a flying toss what you think ",Mini Cooper

hope you get better soon ",Mini Cooper

seems like basically the same size",Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,so is it bigger or not,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,brand loyalty and desire for an ev will only get you so far this mini is still too expensive and range limited so it would be the mg for me,Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,250  id say the car sounds more like a scifi spaceship than a robot to me,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,looks like a suzuki swift to me,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,the round screen is a gimmick the og mini was very much about cost saving and the round dial was because analog dials were round a square screen with regular android would make a lot more sense call me a spoilsport but why pay for that,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,thanks robert great review not to be negative but ive been a bit more critical of the latest mini refresh i want a small electric car for the limited city driving i do so range its my issue but as a mini purist the exterior design has been downhill for ages not to mention this model is still larger than the first 2 iterations im not a fan of either the front end its looking like a lexus and especially the backend which no longer looks like a mini and the back turn lights point in the wrong direction again the price is odd the electric models are apparently made in china so maybe the higher price is from tariffs sadly the mini is billed as a premium car not driving an oversized suv shouldnt be premium,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,and i feel like we need to hear more about neville,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,love my cooper se 22 solid and handles like a dream only downside is range cant even get it to do 100miles,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,i love mine too i dont really get roberts persistent negativity towards it i dont really care that it wasnt built from the ground up as an ev it doesnt feel compromised to me but im not an auto expert i havent had an issue with range mine gets around 120 miles to the charge pretty consistently in warm weather,Mini Cooper
2024-07-25,ive never got less than 100 below zero on the motorway ive done over 120 in the summer and more on ab roads,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,i find the contouring in the head liner for a grab handle thats not there annoying and the range is a little disappointing i get 335 miles of range from my kona electric,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,there isnt a reason to take it simple as that at those prices you find more km they only have the name and they think that they can win only by that,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,from now on bobby should always do the back seat test,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,chordal  lfoy,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,im really not a fan of that rear end i find it visually offensive but i like everything else,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,just when evs are seeming like a remotely possible choice along comes bmw with an impractical overpriced toy with crap range oops  its about 5 years out of date already,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,i think the front end isnt great looking and the back is just plain ugly the interior looks kinda cheap the round screen is cool but i am a mini fan  less and less as they go on though would i buy one no way if the price was cut in half i would my old chevy bolt ev isnt much bigger was dirt cheap used is faster and has significantly more range i dont hate this mini but it has so much wasted potential im curious what the vw id2 gti will be like when it comes out  now that looks awesome,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,never thought id see a display that looks like a dinner plate but there you go,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,so overpriced for whats on offer a byd dolphin blows it out the water if you can look past the brand,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,nothing is more relaxing than a old style car review by bobby,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,took 1 out for a drive its a nice car but i told the sales guy its just too expensive especially with the c3 renault 5 panda and the inster coming soon,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,the inverted arrows tail light design is awfully deceiving,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,transcontinental 120 mile real world range,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,looks alright but the price is shocking the mkwh is poor really really hate the big round blob screen in the middle of the dash to cap it all it looks like it has the just plain daft front charging port jack would love it would have pointed that out which forces you to reverse out of a charging bay rather than the safer highway code recommended forwards,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,yes but what are eucs,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,i want one,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,really like their inside styling not so much the outside the worn bar of soap look meh,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,30k is just too much imagine if someone did a fiat 500 little pocket rocket 10k electric car it would sell like hot cakes,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,i see what youre saying but the cheapest car on sale today is almost 14k i just dont think its possible to make a 10k car anymore with the extra safety regulations,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,charliegb03 yeah its a fair point   the lowest priced fiat 500 is now almost 17k which is nuts,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,you didnt mention charging speed which is also a factor to consider when driving long distance i think its 95kw charging rate but you would have to confirm robert,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,looks awful,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,me ma would probably love this if the range was 200mi daughter lives 80mi away  couldnt make a round trip using this without topping up the charge disappointing ,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,presenting style is waffling annoying umming and arring,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,i really find it wild that i am still watching you robert i had been a long time viewer of the junkyard wars so insane youre still at it hope to see you for years to come,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,they nailed the looks but the range and cost are shamefully bad,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,yawn,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,its 50 more expensive than petrol the range is rubbish charging speed is catastrophic and the suspension is non existent truly lovely,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,and the whole car is an excuse to stealth move mini production out of the uk,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,love the car looks but the commenter is weird in my opinion,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,having just come back from goodwood this sunday seeing all the chinese electric cars if european car companies dont drop there prices then they are going to be in big trouble big big trouble byd fantastic choice,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,i think the design is absolutely on point it is now much cleaner simplified and it certainly looks as iconic as ever i know the range is not the best and the price is maybe a bit to highbut i would definitely get this one instead of an mg4 or a e208,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,i had assumed that the traditional car manufacturers were aiming all of their overpriced ev products at their wealthier customers and the business buyers for whom valueformoney is not a priority we have to thank the chinese ev manufacturers for showing them up and providing another option,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,its the same with any new to market product,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,alantov sure its to be expected and a wellworn path however there will be many of us not buying an ev until their value hopefully improves,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,95kw max charging is just late to the game this would have been a good choice if it had 125kw but alas bmw not understanding anything again,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,the front of this is hideous the rear made me sick in my mouth,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,think id prefer a go kart to that hideous vehicle as for suspension minis dont have any looks cheap and nasty,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,sterile and unmini flimsylooking fenders ugly tail lights distracting dinner plate stuck on the dash pretending to be a display,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,yeah the range has killed it 150 realworld is not enough i drive 200 a day and this wouldnt work charging at services is expensive and you have to queue up the citroen ec3 is a budget 21k car with similar range mini should go down the abarth route and make them superfun if the range isnt here  also that grill should be more black and less body colour in my opinion,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"i feel the exterior is a downgrade from the previous one it looks a lot angrier in the back and lifelessominous in the front the lack of chrome trim looks so cheap especially around the headlamps
that being said itll probably be my next car when they make them in the uk again i could never buy a chinese car i loved the rant at the end calling out oems on overpriced evs",Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,is it a chinese import or still made at cowley,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,so why is this mini better than the previous mini e from 2020 i cant see any difference its for diehard mini enthusiasts only and even they must know they are being taken for mugs,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,i just want to see a mini version of the citroen ami the way fiat did  this isnt mini size hasnt been since it was rebooted 20 years ago so a proper tiny mini would be fun,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,n the united states the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa has mandated that all new electric and hybrid vehicles must emit sounds when travelling at speeds below 186 mph 30 kmh to help prevent accidents involving pedestrians especially those who are visually impaired it seems mini does it at high speed to ,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,its a bit plain and the range doesnt motivate people to hop on board for the whole electric thing i will stick with my bmw i3s which has more real life range and is far more practical,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,still no 4 door version even though theyve made a 4 door gas mini hatchback for a while now,Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,funky robot car sound  the jetsons,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,its a pig,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"this is a much better review than most i love how instead of trying to describe how the car handles and feel through steering and inches of legroom he just got straight to the point its not boring its fun to drive range is less but still sufficient for most people getting in the back can be hard for some but once in its decent and focused on the screen the ease of use the head up display position the styling elements because its a mini and the price all of this without so much drama 
cant all reviews be like this one and the others by robert",Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,hate the new inside of this car they ruined it none of the charm of a mini,Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,702  omg   as an owner of a r56 cooper s and 60 years old i was not prepared for what was to take place  i apologize as i laughed myself silly watching rob attempt to place himself in the rear seat   i have no doubt the cameraman after hearing those grunts and sounds dialed up roadside extraction services to rescue rob     in 2007 getting in the rear of my 6speed mini cooper s was not a problem however doing the same in 2024 is not an option  excellent review,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,i think the point missed here is that this is a mini and it is electric why would you not love it,Mini Cooper
2024-07-20,thisisdibble it is not a mini it is a chinese attempt at a mini looks like a suzuki swift,Mini Cooper
2024-07-20,ahh to a degree you are right and i am proud that my mini se was assembled in the uk but rob l needs to get off the negative about electric minis,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,the back looks rubbish nothing like a mini the whole point of a mini is its a mini and looks like one ive had 5 mini in the past but not this one,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,may i ask you for a measurement please i need to know the distance from the ground to the edge of the front seats  maybe 21 22 23 or whatever   the height of the seats above the ground is more important to us than the 0 to 60   thanks,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,finally a car that theyve properly designed the radar sensor black box thing for so many cars have them plonked on but the mini has it neatly in the centre,Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,thats not a review its an old bloke talking about his life experiences and what he thinks of this brand not informative at all he hasnt really ever been actually tbh please let other people review it i agree with the rant tho,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,and the blinkers still point the wrong way lol,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,i saw one of these yesterday in a car park its a lovely looking thing and i warmed to it a lot more than i thought it would its far too expensive for what it is though the hyundai inster and renault 5 are much better prospects,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,the people who buy a mini are prepared to pay a slight premium for it so the price is not really that unexpected it is definitely an improvement on the previous one and that is certainly important im happy to say that my 2018 kia soul ev a converted compliance vehicle routinely gets between 38 and 42 miles per kilowatt hour despite its blocky shape,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,can someone build a polo sized car with no flashy rubbish just a holder for a phone no stupid screens or massive led headlights which will cost a fortune to fix in a bump the headlights in my hillman imp worked fine 200 miles range and for 15k,Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,looks ok range crap  and it comes from china,Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,"ive had minis since 2010 and glad to see that the new model still holds up especially an e version price definitely needs to come down to be affordable though currently driving what will be my last petrol car that im intending to drive until i can no longer do so just hope that an electric mini will be more affordable when that time comes determinded to stick with minis after my old 2013 model was written off in an accident a few years ago but the safety measures built in meant i walked away from what could have been fatal in other makes 

do hope that whoosh sound can be customised to be something else like a starbug woosh",Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,wouldve been nice to see what the mapsnavigation looks like kinda went to show us but you were in the middle of a field so it was showing nothing or something with a screen like that i think its a main feature of the car and shuldve been showed off more the interface kinda seemed quite laggy but it wasnt really used so its hard to tell just clik the radio or air conditioning button or something and show nagivation for just 10 seconds to see if its terrible or not and if we have to get a phone mount out to just use google maps instead good video otherwise as usual though,Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,holy moly what did they do to the back  looks terrible,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"cant speak for the euro market but here in the states theres a well known issue with pricing evs initially had some tax incentives for being green varies by state but they were higher priced as a new technology high cost of manufacturing expensive batteries etc then state governments realized they were loosing a decent bit of bag from taxes at the fuel pump

fast forward a few years and now manufacturing is a bit more dialed in battery tech has become more efficient and pricing for batteries has gone down but the governments imposed sly tax slaps on evs to recover the revenue lost from fuel purchases ironically the standard half ton pickup ie ford f150 chevy silverado 1500 etc have become one of the most popular vehicles here and price to powerprice to weight of material sold is quite low relative to modern pricing some of these top model truckssuvs go beyond 100k which is ludicrous 

depending on the state there is a bit of a tax incentive on makersdealers to sell vehicles below 25 mph because it increases fuel sales addon that in many agricultural states i live in florida for example these standard pickups are categorized as a tool to assist in agricultural economy and are then incentivized even more they are also sociallyideologically considered safer so insurance is often less and these models are popular so parts are readily available etc etc etc

never owned an ev the areas i live in are not perfectly fit for it in my use case so i am not sure what taxes are put on electricity purchases at charging stations i would imagine its still a commodity when used as vehicle power but maybe its considered a utility purchase i dont see why they wouldnt be able to tax charging stations like fuel pumps to at least make the vehicle value more appealing",Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,man this feels like a tiny improvement over the honda e but really not where it should be in 2024 as you rightly said with the chinese capable of doing cars going further for cheaper is it because of their controlling the supply chain or most of it anyway for battery manufacturing,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,buttons are the only sane way to do controls in cars the goal has to be to make it possible to use them all using muscle memory without having to look touch buttons you have to literally stare at them to try to hit them especially if theyre on a huge swath of touch screen glass the lack of buttons nowadays is part cost saving part wrongheadedness are big touch screens kind of cool sure are the an awful primary way to control the car also yes this doesnt look quite as egregious as your tesla for instance overall a car i wouldnt mind owning tbh at least it has two doors so the doors dont have to be 30 cm long  these open properly and you have oodles of space to get in and out realistically youre hardly going to put people in the back of a car this size all that often and if you do its going to be kids who can slither in with consummate ease i hate tiny four doors,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,sorry but still cant get around having to call it a mini a nothing like the original b now the size of a midrange car c beginning to look like many other mass market cars glad they are still focusing on electric but i think that my dads maxi was smaller ,Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,for the life of me i dont understand how a dedicated ev platform manages to produce a car with a lower mpkwh and dramatically worse range than the renault zoe i bought in 2018 which really did do 180 miles in the summer never mind the one i got in 2020 which really did do 230 miles that was a five door supermini that was only about 20cm longer and basically the same width yet with a much bigger boot and it wasnt even a dedicated ev platform i just dont understand what bmw are playing at  this mini feels like terrible value for money on the ev basics ,Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,i firmly believe it theres a 15 markup on the petrol version then theres a 80100 on the electric one i remember journalists saying evs will be cheaper due to lower cost of parts and fewer parts and cheap charging yet we see luxury prices for 4 seaters and ranges that the chinese had in 2010 i cant wait for the oncoming storm to wash out all this crap so freedom of movement wont be a luxury,Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,the price remains high because of lack of real volume sales ice cars are 100 x the sales and so development costs can be recovered quicker and volume manufacturing plus higher volume materials and parts outsourcing can negotiate lower parts pricing and obviously because manufacturers will continue to maximise profit as long as there is no real competition to reduce that when consumers are force to go totally ev those cheaper ice cars will fall off the sales sheet and the consumer will have no option but to pay higher prices  its a winwin for the manufacturers long term sadly at the expense of the consumer,Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,"i owned a mini se 2021 for three years and it was a lot better than roberts assessment of the outgoing model few modern groundup evs are as efficient  i got 43mikwh over the winter 
but the cost of the mini has jumped from the low 20ks at launch to the mid 30ks and to replace my 2021 model with the new mini would cost 35k for an equivalent model 
i used to own a 2016 mini cooper and wanted a similar five door electric back in 2021 i was hoping this time mini would correct their error of omitting a five door option from the electric range while still offering it in petrol but they didnt the aceman is a countryman light not a cooper  and frankly looks awful so i bought a volvo ex30 which has five doors is faster nice but not critical has over the air updates dont want to spend a day at the garage for a 20 min firmware update like i did with the old mini is only slightly bigger than the mini has a similar ride but much better suspension and costs less
imo as a mini fan and ev owner mini need to add a five door cooper and drop the price or up the range one or the other as the current options are poor value when compared to smart 13 volvo ex30 mg4 the soon to arrive renault 5 and now the prices have dropped corsa e and fiat 500e

the new mini is a chinese car at oxford prices",Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,i would disagree that 150 miles 240km is enough range for longrange driving you want the range for 70 of the battery 1080 as this is the range where charging is fast to give you more than two hours on the highway a comfortable interval to stop at 70 of 240km is 168km which is barely an hour and a half driving so about 300350km range is the sweetspot,Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,averagejoe840 exactly once over it took the best part of a week to cover 250 to 300 miles you stayed overnight in coaching inns while the horses were fed or changed its simply a question of adjusting expectations and perceptions one day there will be no more petrol to buy of course there will be synthetic alternatives but at 25 per gallon the queues wont be long,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,averagejoe840 this is true but not every has off street parking or the money for the 40 hike on insurance and for that odd case that you do have to do 200 miles in one go instead of a 3 to 35 hour drive its going to take the best part of 5 to 55 hours dont get me wrong i love the idea of evs i think its great and i have driven one and enjoyed it a lot but until they can get that kind of range i cannot justify the expense for me to buy one sorry,Mini Cooper

lets say i do a trip out on my home charged battery and for the sake of argument use a whole 50kwh then charge that 50kwh for the journey back

the trip out cost me 375 of electricity the trip back cost me 3250

2024-07-16,"i knew what robert was going to say about the suspension long before he said it you could see how rough it was from the inside camera as he was driving along roads i know that arent that bad

150 mile real world range is really barely adequate unless you only want to potter around town come winter  unless it has heated seatshvac not mentioned the range is going to plunge
it isnt a case of inadequate charging infrastructure more a case of always needing to be conscious of where you need to stop next and a short range also means those outofrange trips are going to cost a lot more home charging is so much cheaper than using even the cheapest rapid charger

i occasionally do a run to heathrow through the cotswolds  120 miles a 100 home charge costs me 3 for my remaining 261kwh of battery then i need 3x 2080 rapid charges along the way that cost me 33 if i had the newer version of my car i could just make the trip on my initial charge  which would cost me 10",Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,it shares its platform with the gwm ora as gwm and bmw developed the platform together i find it interesting that the gwm gets a bigger battery though and that the mini has much less range i can see some gwm bits in the interior as well and id bet that a fair bit of the mechanicals are gwm too  in essence its a chinese german british car,Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,ora died on its arse as a brand kind of odd to see it as a reskinned mini anyway too expensive and not enough range,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,the old version did about 130 which is way more that most people drive in a day i always wonder what daily mileage people who moan about ev range actually do truth is 10yrs ago lots of people bought evs with a 80 mile maximum range and had no issues at all as a daily driver seems to me people convince themselves they are doing intercontinental tours all the time when in reality they go to aldi on a saturday and 20 miles a day to work ,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"to some of us its not the day to day rangebut the ability to get somewere in a hurry or a sudden decision 
we drive a 2024 hyundai kona n line s ev and are currently 85 miles from home on holiday used 25 range to get here which is fine
i also use a diesel berlingo van  for work
but even full up the kona shows 304 miles and my 82 year old mum lives 255 miles away in north devon so for me a range of 600 miles would ease my mind as the berlingo will do on a tank of diesel should the worse come to the worse and i dont have hours to charge
i guess  my perfect  range might be higher than a lot of peoples nd in time 12 years maybe main stream evs will have that range but for the here and now for us its a mix of diesel and electric",Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,this is very true theres always a compromise smaller car small batter decent efficiency vs larger car large battery worse efficiency bmw have obviously worked out that this is a okay range for the target customer for people who want more range they can get a countryman its also likely to be a city urban car or a second car anyway so most people would be fine with a 140 mile range my wife has an i3 and that range is around 175 miles but she never drives more than about 75 miles in a day so it is ideal for big trips i have an ix with 300400 mile range but i would much prefer the i3 for nipping about day to day,Mini Cooper
2024-07-20,well pachy444 so would you pay that ridiculous price for whatever that is suppose to be a chinese attempt at a mini i think it is with an abysmal range for the price,Mini Cooper
2024-07-20,i think its similar thinking as to why people are so entranced by suvs and big suvs at that namely that they see them as a vehicle for every occasion when in reality a 5door hatchback will do 99 of everything they actually need it for just without the high driving position,Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,since late 2023 the electric mini cooper is developed and produced in china at the spotlight automotive joint venture facility in zhangjiagang jiangsu it seems bmw made a major error in judgement building it in china eu tarrffs may make it uncompetitive in the uk market its way past time bmw manufactured it here and stopped being cheapscates,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,the electic mini coded jox same as chinese but made in oxford was supposed to launch in 2026 for western europe ans us this has been put on stop because of certain issues with spotlight and gwoch regarding the tarrifs eu is going to decrease tarrifs for bmw and vw electric cars made in china so we will see how that affects the electic mini arrival to oxford i hope they will come to some agreement and they restart the project it would create quite a few jobs,Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,the problem with it apart from the poor range is that it just doesnt look premium inside or out and mini has over the last 25 years been sold as a premium product yes the shape is mini although worse than the outgoing model but the overall look is mass market not premium,Mini Cooper

2024-07-17,brianom2hhif this car is being sold as a fun driving car its not actually possible to justify its failings on  you are going to use it mainly on commuting  if im buying a commuter car im spending the minimum amount of money for a mobility box this is for spontaneously deciding to drive the highlands or welsh hills at speed and not worry that the cold or the speed im going or the cases im carrying will not get me to the next charger,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,brianom2hh if it can do 240km at 110kmph then we cant complain battery density hasnt improved that much in 4 years i live in one of the largest states in the world and frequently do 900km trips in a day in my mini cooper d i usually drive 500km without stopping but happy to stop at the middlepoint to charge which is 200km from my place,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,i agree my 2019 egolf gets 145 and it was a compliance car made from an existing ice platform the fact that mini built this from the group up and still could only get the range to 190 bestcase scenario is quite pitiful,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,brianom2hh mini is an international brand and this model is planned for international distribution designing a car based on the commute of a population that lives on an island is a huge oversightmiscue,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,theuselessgeneration i think any new car being released now should have a minimum 52kwh battery and for a small car maybe 67kwh for the larger battery version i havent done enough research into this car yet but from what im hearing its just not quite there with its range capabilities theres no such thing as a city car everyone travels to family or does trips up and down the motorway so you need to be able to do those things in a small car just as much as you do in a bigger car at this point i think its a great car much nicer than the outgoing model but there are better evs out there for the same money and i think mini have been missing a trick for so long now i lost interest in them years ago back in the early 00s everyone drove a mini they are no longer a go too car for younger people kickstarting their careers and buying their first car i think the fiat 500 has taken up that spot,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,pato10111 how would they physically fit a battery of that size in a mini my atto 3 long range has a 60kwh battery and its a small sized suv im happy to have a range as low as 250300km110kmph in a small sized car this mini is far too expensive has worse efficiency than my car bad suspension loud motor and no physical switches they are going to continue to face this issue unless we break the battery density issue,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,theuselessgeneration physical switches are not needed if touch screen is done properly and some brands do it very well its about striking a balance if they can get a larger battery in an id3 they can get one in a mini i think the biggest problem mini has faced for years is that its never really evolved past this one shape yes there are other models but none of them are practical as small suvs so ultimately mini should be looking at prioritising space in their vehicles,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,pato10111  i like my mini for the physical switches and size wouldnt want something larger like a clubman its not that i prefer switches over a gui i just like how the switches feel in my mini and always have associated that with mini,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,brianom2hh yeah the range is fine for a small city car not for 40 grand tho,Mini Cooper
2024-07-18,theuselessgeneration i own a polestar and the touch screen is brilliant its just done right and the car runs on an android system so you have google built in without the need to even have a phone on you there was a period where cars got too fiddly but i think some brands are getting the balance right now between touch screen and physical knobs essentially its about creating a simple easily accessible interior i owned two jcws in the past nice cars but older generations and they just kept breaking so i moved away from the brand i think the f56 was a good car though my mum has one,Mini Cooper

the joys of getting older  but if you cannot do 150 miles on a motorway in a lot less than 3 hours roadworks permitting then i suggest bobby you are no longer particularly safe on motorways

i suspect the range is actually closer to 190 miles in urban environments under 4mkw but 150 miles on motorway at normal motorway speeds sounds about right  but the mini is not intended as a motorway cruiser merely a city car so for that the range is fine

2024-07-16,great review rob i had the f56 mini electric i loved it you got to consider the mini factor about 100miles is about 90miles once youve really booted it i loved my old mini electric but with a fatal flaw of 90miles range it really wasnt usable even for motorway commuting as you cant guarantee the destination would have charging and public charging is so costly anyway i suspect with the newest mini ev the range of approx 150miles would drop to around 130miles once you had abit of fun in it still not a usable range in my opinion i think 200miles is an optimum range in the uk to get from ab and back again without getting stung by public charging which in some cases is more expensive than fuel i think it should really be used to top up i found myself regularly charging near empty at public chargers ive gone back to petrol but in the hope that public leccy will get less expensive and when evs come down in price with an effective range of around 200miles ,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,love the screen,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,140 miles is 2 hours on the motorway not 3,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,140 miles is 7 hours on the m25,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,avg motorway speed in the uk is just under 50mph iirc yes the limit is 70mph  but youre not going to achieve that for long due to congestion roadworks and so on,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,where ,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,maybe at 2am,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,rtfazeberdee3519 maybe,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,other than some of the exterior styling this is good the hud combined with the screen looks great,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,the back of it really gives me chinese car design vibes but i cant place my finger on why presumably this is a concious decision by bmw in order to try and sell in the biggest car market on earth,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,yes and it will be half price in china,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"sorry but 150 miles of range isnt enough by any stretch of the imagination averages can be misleading because they do not account for the difference between daily commute and weekend journeys that a lot of people make my daily drive is no more than 10 miles but on the weekends i often do 400 miles
i dont even want to think about having to stop at the services 23 times during the weekend no less with my 2 toddlers in the car and having to queue for who knows how long to wait for a charger that is going to be much much slower than advertised if it works at all
so no robert 150 miles isnt enough for most of the people that i know so please stop saying that",Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,a friend told me that his brother has had several electric cars and he said that range anxiety is not a problem if a car has a range of 200 miles or more that seems like a reasonable statement,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,catherinegrimes2308 depends on the distance and the charging situation i cannot charge at home when visiting my hometown which means that i have to charge at the services thats going to take at least a couple of hours which is more than half of the duration of the whole journey id call that quite unreasonable,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,cant believe the range is still so bad ,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,140 mile range as someone in the market for a smaller ev 200 miles real range is what id want from a car 140 is just a no go,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,yes because you do how many miles a day 2530,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,they do a longer range one as well,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,if you put in into the context of the average daily uk commute being 208 miles and the average uk motorway journey being 70 to 80 miles is it really so bad  why pay for a car or battery that has 300 miles of range if you only drive a 300 mile trip twice a year,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,pachy444its not about that my car is not just a daily commuter its a weekend adventure vehicle too i dont want to have 2 cars i want one that does it all and for me that means 200 miles of real world range as it happens my tesla exceeds that by over a hundred miles but i will accept thats just a luxury not a need,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,thats the base model the se model claims 250 mile wltp so probably more like 200 in the real world but obviously its more expensive,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,brianom2hhbecause on weekends families go on long drives range anxiety shouldnt unnecessarily increase their stress,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,pachy444 i cant charge at home and dont want to spend 40 minutes every other day sitting at a public super charger getting ripped off with grossly inflated electricity prices,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,gemmafletcher5611wait for the hyundai inster,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,zeehunter i can imagine this is being marketed as a second car or a car that isnt intended for long journeys which is fair enough they have other cars in the range for that purpose,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,i am very slowly coming round to the idea of an ev but for me although range is important i think length of charging time is the constant niggling issue in my head,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,brianom2hh because twice a year that trip is an absolute ballache or even impossible if you are going to a remote location,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,usermg8pj8vl2gthat only really matters if youre not doing home  work charging which of course you may well be doing,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,pachy444 its not just about average mate i may just do 1020 miles on a weekday but the weekends are a different story altogether as i often do 400 miles and when i say often i mean twice a month or more so no electric cars still dont work for me no matter how much i like them,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"theodorev666 we do full mini events over weekends away from home in our 2020 se for the last four years weve charged away from home during those events and charging has often taken less time then getting the coffee
50k mi in the last 4 years we go away at the weekend 3 up with luggage no issues",Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,30 grand for 140 miles less in winter nah,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"all ev range is still appalling 

my brother takes 1214hrs to drive to newcastle from bath due to the number of charges required and the slow charging this is a 6 hour journey the low range just isnt acceptable at all",Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,brianom2hhbecause you need to,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,pachy444 140150 miles is still in the range that most people would go in a spontanous trip on the weekend without holiday planning but most people wouldnt accept a charging stop with that small of a distance so it is really pushing it as this would probably would mean about 120miles of frange without worrying about range and that is not alot,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,usermg8pj8vl2g for me 7kw destination chargers are the fastest ones  and cheapest by far  i say fastest because you plug in and get on with your evening  so it takes 30 seconds  a fast charger 100kw say will take about 20 minutes and you have to sit with it  i work away all week so just pick hotels with chargers  oddly golf club hotels tend to have free chargers  which is nice ,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,eleyckiout of interest in what ev 300 ish miles in a tesla m3 or anything with 200 miles of range is very different to say a 24kwh nissan leaf with 1st gen slow rapid charging or a zoe lacking a rapid charge port at all i regularly do a 500 mile trip in under 12 hours in my id4 for example not all ev range is the same,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,average daily journey distance in the uk is less than 40 miles,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,eleyckito put your comment into context if i picked up a second hand kia eniro for around 13k id expect to spend no more than 45 minutes charging somewhere around sheffield on that journey assuming i could find somewhere local to top up at the far end most modern electric cars are perfectly capable of making that journey without fuss a small local runabout like the overpriced mini featured here is not representative of the real world im afraid,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,bmwmini are just maximising profit here hence its badged as a cooper model they probably think its race car heritage will attract a higher price and lower range as did the coopers of old,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"johnsweet1915 my brother has a new id3 and the 350 miles takes three stops of a sensible length ie lunch coffee etc but each of these have to be  an hour say as charging is shared and slow every service station is too popular and chargers are broken so he needs to queue to charge or drive off route it takes a huge amount of time 
also normal journey lengths when you dont live in a city are much longer remember 
they need way more range or way way faster charging",Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,usermg8pj8vl2g before i bought one i just calculated my daily driving miles for me i only drove over 150 miles occasionally we bought an i3 as a second car but it soon became the car we used most of the time,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,eleyckinot really specd for that sort of journey better going for the bigger battery option having said that 150 miles at average 50mph is still 3 hours,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"everyone complaining about range simply are not the target costumer for this kind of vehicle
its simple if you want one car to do everything get a hybrid it will be better than any electric car can be for that purpose
if you already have a bigger petrol car for long trips however these small electric cars are your perfect second car in the family for a daily commute smaller battery so less weight to lug around and faster charging you use it on week days in the city and you use the big petrol car on weekend trips on the motorway",Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,silverghini2629 apart from on motorways where there is no regen so the range is even worse the big one still isnt big enough  quick enough to charge,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,eleycki or we should just travel less,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"oddjobsandrandomprojects in which case electric cars are completely pointless 
some of us have to travel for work given the role and services we offer",Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"stevenjones916 agreed i cant even consider an ev because of this fact alone
i live in a street that has a car park at the end for our vehicles but it is on a leasehold the car park management company simply refuses to install ev chargers for all of us
the nearest public charger is a 10 minute drive away which means id have to babysit the car for an hour every other day just to be able to commute to work
until the ev charging network is sorted out once and for all owning an ev will remain a status symbol for the _haves_ and ics for the us plebby _havenots_",Mini Cooper

2024-07-16,eleycki some of us do but many others dont so that makes them a very good choice for those people i know an ev with even a 100 mile range would make my life easier and cheaper,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,oddjobsandrandomprojects maybe get a bike,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,eleycki actually a great idea if the area i live in would work for that i have a 10 mile drive to work but its all 55mph no shoulder on the road,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,pachy444averages like that are irrelevant people need flexibility from their car,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,eleycki and there are evs with up to 500 mile ranges on the market currently so i dont know how that is appalling since ive had petrol cars that dont do that of course without home charging it also isnt much of an advantage either,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,chriswhite7727 i dont want to imagine having to queue at the services to charge once each way for an unknown amount of time during the weekend no less with chargers being slow or not working at all while having two toddlers in the car and then waste even more of my time looking for a fast charger in my hometown and all that for a journey that with my normal yaris hybrid it takes no more than 3 hours with a nice comfort break around halfway no thanks sounds like a chore,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,jakecoventry9004 yeah but for that range you can get a used vw egolf for 16th the price and have more room inside the small bells and whistles in the interior do not justify the cost if it cant also go a full week without having to charge with even an average daily commute,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,oddjobsandrandomprojects better but 500 range means 400 real world 350 from 8010 say plus a slow charge,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,eleycki and that still beats a number of petrol vehicles so then its really just the problem of slower refill time but i usually stop of i do drive that far and take a walk and get some food or drink so it wouldnt be a big deal for me or anyone traveling for pleasure now for business its a different story but even then companies are supposed to have you take a break so then its kind of a built in break timer,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,this car is a joke,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,eleycki my tesla might make that trip in one charge ive managed 330 a few times but even if it didnt it would only need a 10 minutes charge somewhere along the route to guarantee it coincide it with a pee break and youre exactly the same time as an ice car nobody being realistic goes six hours driving without needing to pee personally its every 2 hours and from my passengers requests for pee breaks i go longer than most,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,theaegisclaw i think tesla is the exception due to the charging infrastructure for sure everyone else is lining up for ionity trickle charge there is no way on earth i can afford a tesla however plus the build quality and interior is crap,Mini Cooper
2024-07-21,zeehunter i thought families all had ginormous suvs with better range these days  this is not what the mini is intended for its to take the children to school,Mini Cooper
2024-07-21,stevenjones916 i cant charge at home and have the old mini even less range and manage perfectly well on the slower 7kw chargers on the street and in the local car parks the prices are more reasonable and its still way cheaper to run than my old petrol cooper s,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,i have always absolutely loved the new mini design but i wish they would change that round display into a more normal style,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,visually i like everything except the rear its too angular for a mini and for british design in general that black strip is really ugly there was no need to break the design flow there,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,resplendent in fully charged yellow id be comparing it to something like the hyundai inster i prefer the inster,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,indeedthe inster will be at least 10k cheaper than the mini be more practical well built as all hyundais are and more comfy mini is an exercise in style over substance and later this year it will be up against the renault 5 which is even more funky cute and will no doubt be much cheaper,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,better but still pretty poor mileskwh per  compared to the competition,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"not a fan of the design of this at all looks like a toy and sometimes thats fun and i generally like that in some cars but they should have kept more of the regular mini design in this much better looking car but good to see a dedicated ev platform
my favorite small ev is probably the honda e with all its drawbacks it was so cool and ill have one maybe in 5 years when a small car like that can have 25 times the energy storage onboard 
the zoe is another nice small ev it was cheap for a while then it went up did spot one just the other day
im still hooked on the first generation kia niro ev haha would still be good today with 400 kms of range in most models it has not changed that much unless you buy 80k  120k cars
best part about that car is that it looks like a normal car inside and out not overly complicated",Mini Cooper

once the short cuts are created you have direct access to them from the key on the oblong key pad showing a car with 3 horizontal line  tap the favourites key and you big screen shows all the short cuts yes i agree its a convoluted way to get to the functions to inhibit them  some cars now have a dedicated button on the dash now to disable both functions pity bmw has gone down the switch and buttonless dash route though ive had my counttyman s e with exactly the same system since the first week of april and its now first thing i do after turning on the power key thingy",Mini Cooper

2024-07-03,i like the direction bmw have gone with the new model  the cleaned up styling is a big improvement over the increasingly fraught surfacing of the previous gen i also like that the 5 door has been deleted  it always looked awful to me conceptually the interior is simpler but some design choices like having a toggle switch for experiences rather than something useful like cabin temperature seems crass some of the interior materials and mouldings look cheap to its a shame then that the simpler design approach hasnt really paid off on the price as its expensive for a small car with small battery  a small range thats made in china 25k feels more right and so it will be interesting to see how it fares against cars like the renault 5 when that hits the showrooms,Mini Cooper
2024-07-03,a claimed range of 190 miles means 100 miles in reality at best in sunny weather and downhill  a cold winter day in sweden with minus 15 celsius means a careful slow trip to the grocery store and back  if you are lucky       the 240 mile version just mean that you can run out of electricity with a faster acceleration       this is only for use within a city,Mini Cooper

2024-07-04,jonathantaylor1998 the petrol version is 23k which is still steep but ok and at least made in the uk this chinese made ev is pure post pandemic profiteering regardless of what you say expect to see them pre registered and heavily discounted on autotrader in a few months,Mini Cooper
2024-07-04,santostvi owned a 2004 cooper 14996 a 2007 cooper s 17669 a 2015 cooper s 19756 and a 2018 cooper 19874 so im well aware of their pricing structure this is a gwm built chinese cost cutting exercise with no slush formed plastics or real depth of quality and its over 30kcome on,Mini Cooper
2024-07-04,"nexus6variant  they cant devalue their brand simple as that the smart 1 is also chinese based and isnt that cheap the chinese want to enter the market and do blitzscalling cant afford it so they are doing what they did in china by partnering up for their smallerbrands

we will see if the french offerings are indeed good",Mini Cooper
2024-07-06,nexus6variant my thoughts exactly,Mini Cooper
2024-07-03,"hmm so slower than the older model and range is only a bit more as outgoing gave more than claimed 120 where this is much lower 140  and that back end is erm ugly and nothing like mini styling 

renault 5 seems a better option on face of it",Mini Cooper
2024-07-04,the se is rated as 250miles range,Mini Cooper
2024-07-04,"richard7071 in the review it was stated real world was more like 140 in lower sized battery matched by ev database

but lets say its closer to rated

im not sure a city car should be chasing range i get many struggle with concept of perceived low range but 100 miles is plenty for a city car average drive for most not all most people is 35 miles

old version 1440kg new low range version 1615kg is the other consequence two passengers worth of added weight",Mini Cooper
2024-07-04,dreador my point was that anyone phased by the range of the e could always lash out and buy the se i often drive from sydney to canberra 325km so the extra range counts realistically if you want to follow the advice about not charging beyond 80 and arent foolhardy enough to go below 10 realistic range is about 70 of what you could get driving from 100 to 0 that makes 400km more like 280km and then subtract a bit from that for adverse conditionsfreeway driving and its probably closer to 220km  but thats the maximum id do in 2 hours driving and ill usually stop for half an hour anyway after 2 hours driving  so the se makes sense over the e,Mini Cooper
2024-07-04,"richard7071 if i was doing that mileage id be looking at a different car to be fair  

if im going on a long run i regularly charge to 100 at home if im going to use it straight away as such  80 for me is the rule more for rapid charging and thats more around time more than anything",Mini Cooper
2024-07-04,dreador thats about once every 68 weeks for the majority of the time i do less than 100km per day,Mini Cooper
2024-07-03,"looks goot
only small ev i would consider am booked in for a test drive",Mini Cooper
2024-07-03,video editing  overexposed ,Mini Cooper
2024-07-03,not sure why you wouldnt buy a smart 1 instead more space more range more equipment as standard faster charging better performance and rear wheel drive plus 4 doors not 2,Mini Cooper
2024-07-03,5k more gets you a tesla model 3 68 miles more range than the cooper se and a second faster to 60 mph more space and access to the tesla super charger network,Mini Cooper
2024-07-03,"that kind of arms race mentality is exact why we dont get genuine affordable alternatives away from premium vehicles like tesla
think",Mini Cooper
2024-07-04,and yet im not even slightly tempted by that,Mini Cooper
2024-07-05,but a tesla really looks like a more old fashioned sierra,Mini Cooper
2024-07-03,im sorry but 30k for a electric mini is still way to expensive for most folk 5 years ago a basic golf was 20k better built and 50 larger,Mini Cooper
2024-07-03,sorry 32k with level 1 pack,Mini Cooper
2024-07-03,"5 years ago a lot of cars were way cheaper
looking on autotrader to get similar performance to this mini cooper e youd be looking at the polo 20tsi gti dsg 5dr
after discounts thats 27240
so yes all cars  irrespective of what powers them  have rocketed up in price over recent years the days of a cheap hothatch are long gone sadly",Mini Cooper
2024-07-03,theyre taking advantage of the tax breaks company car drivers get so they just pump up the price to make some more profit,Mini Cooper
2024-07-09,20k for a quality fast car good luck with that,Mini Cooper
2024-07-20,instead of all this oversized crap the rich idiots at mini ought to get releasing small versions with portable batteries already  mini was meant to be a tiny vehicle now they are averaged sized cars due to rich idiots and the gay government,Mini Cooper
2024-05-04,"740 who cares for the time it takes to load a battery to 100
interesting is how much energy can be transferred in a specified amount of time
a small battery may reach 100 faster but thats still less energy than a big battery at 70 also a big battery stays at 2080 charge for longer improving charging speed",Mini Cooper
2024-03-17,useable battery capacity is only 29kw not 32,Mini Cooper
2024-01-09,it might be fun funky and all those other irrelevant things but its completely useless wouldnt get me to the coast and back and a good job you didnt get stuck in any trafic i want to enjoy my day out not stress over range and will i get home,Mini Cooper
2023-11-18,i didnt realise this was three years old until towards the end rory drove it in eco mode to get the most from it and still had a loss of around 30 on the claimed range all manufacturers need to do better,Mini Cooper
2023-10-26,they made a mini without a soul horrible,Mini Cooper
2023-10-03,why just focus on range but not other things that are much more important in the driving experience,Mini Cooper
2023-09-17,who else has their fingers crossed to win one of these in the mcdonalds monopoly ,Mini Cooper
2023-09-10,ok review but not brilliant this is technically a terrible attempt at an electric car 100 miles you can get an ebike that will do that on 1 kw charge the model 3 is so far ahead its mad these companies are a joke that actually put these poor attempts into production,Mini Cooper
2023-09-10,"my car which has a conventional internal combustion engine also comes to a complete standstill if i lift my foot off the accelerator
it does not come equipped with a recovery feature",Mini Cooper
2023-09-06,dude i love your videos,Mini Cooper
2023-09-03,im so disappointed about the range,Mini Cooper
2023-08-14,i still wish they had called this the mine,Mini Cooper
2023-07-30,great review mate,Mini Cooper
2023-07-25,range of 100 miles constant range anxiety no thanks ,Mini Cooper
2023-06-14,you add more batteries to a mini and the driving aspect that makes a mini a mini will disappear,Mini Cooper
2023-05-13,its not going to be manufactured here by the end of 2023 its moving to factories in eastern china not really a british car anymore owned by germans manufactured in china,Mini Cooper
2023-01-25,like mini although i would get the newer model ev,Mini Cooper
2022-12-25,hoe do u open the bonnet on this,Mini Cooper
2022-12-24,spot on get a mini ev for most of your driving and have an older suv for the occasional long trips or just rent an ice,Mini Cooper
2022-12-13,drove one for 2 days last weekend had a range of about 180km no room in the boot once charge cables included noone could fit into the back seats the central rearview mirror gets annoyingly in the way when you are trying to look to traffic on the left definitely would not buy one,Mini Cooper
2022-12-10,"i absolutely dislike the yellow accents 

really dulls the overall look",Mini Cooper
2022-11-19,mini electric  british shitty bmw,Mini Cooper
2022-10-24,if you turn on the ac the range will go down to 50 miles,Mini Cooper
2022-10-18,decently fast good range small size pick 2 as of now clearly you cant get all 3 you want a small car thats decently fast and small like this mini cooper then the range wont be great 145 miles that isnt bad and i could pretty much use it as my daily commuter 98 which is what it actually got no thats unacceptable and remember he didnt even have the heat on and was driving in the most economical mode is it safe to say that youd really only get 70 miles yeah not acceptable,Mini Cooper
2022-09-15,pathetic range in my opinion were just not there with electric vehicles yet,Mini Cooper
2022-09-07,im afraid its crap the range is a disaster maybe in another 10 years,Mini Cooper
2022-08-27,top up quickly  so i can buy a 1kwh battery car i can top up super fast and make it even more appealing,Mini Cooper
2022-08-20,"this car has mad power but it doesnt have much miles
so not good for long trips coz u will hav to charge multiple times",Mini Cooper
2022-08-18,so whats it like to push down a country lane in the rain ,Mini Cooper
2022-06-28,why the s  lol,Mini Cooper
2022-06-04,the new facelifted mini cooper electric l3 awd  05 in lift 330 kwh ismartpower 3dr ehatchback rhd could seriously do with a stateoftheart cutting edge awd system  a beefed up suspension setup featuring stiffer springs  shocks and a 05 in variable suspension lift    multispoke alloy wheels shod with standard all season radial tyres with stronger side walls 55 profile for the occasional mild off road    and a reinforced chassis monocoque  body as well for greater torsional rigidity  enhanced stiffening structural integrity    not to mention the mini cooper electric l3 awd  05 in lift 330 kwh ismartpower 3dr ehatchback rhd is in dire need of more power no less than 482 kwh  range which should give you a decent range of 260 miles to 295 miles    even spirited driving the mini cooper electric l3 awd  05 in lift 482 kwh ismartpower 3dr ehatchback rhd should still give you 240 miles to 250 miles range if not more   ,Mini Cooper
2022-05-31,thanks for the review i have chosen a 10 year old ice car as my second car more range and cheaper,Mini Cooper
2022-05-15,imagine buying a car with a threegallon tank that you need to fill up daily and it takes you three hours to fill it up then at some point in the future you need to pay for that fuel again in the form of battery replacement well thats an electric car hahaha,Mini Cooper
2022-05-07,should you buy that the answer is no,Mini Cooper
2022-04-27,145miles,Mini Cooper
2022-04-25,do mini electrics sold in the uk have different size batteries than those for the us market,Mini Cooper
2022-04-25,32kw battery wtf,Mini Cooper
2022-04-23,i would happily pay more for extra range please mini i want one so badly but 100115 miles of range just doesnt cut it in the us,Mini Cooper
2022-03-27,whats confusing it has 65 miles left and hes done 244 and it says he has 75 charge 65  244  894 894  100 x 75  6705 bang on mate,Mini Cooper
2022-03-26,i like the idea of owning one as i have a short commute  however i have 2016  mazda3 20 gets 3540 mpg  my short commute results about 5000 a year so i use about 150 gallons x 4  600  so is it worth for me to upgrade to mini se,Mini Cooper
2022-05-24,600 wow soo lucky the same amount of fuel in uk would cost at least 91984 us 115261 at the garage i go to thats at least expensive local garage,Mini Cooper
2022-03-26,the big question with the mini is reliability is the electric the mini we can count on,Mini Cooper
2022-03-18,its 27000 now,Mini Cooper
2022-03-16,mini electric  beautiful garbage,Mini Cooper
2022-03-09,there are a lot of people online claiming that the mini has much greater range in real life  i thought this video was setting out to test that claim  it didnt  just another mini road test ,Mini Cooper
2022-03-08,100 miles range but you cant use your heating radio or heated seats  what a joke,Mini Cooper
2022-10-25,your range will drop to 50 right away,Mini Cooper
2022-02-28,well written review thanks,Mini Cooper
2022-02-25,it charges faster because its small lol what kind of stupid idea is this of course lol but it doesnt mean you get more range or battery life at all a larger battery gives you more range even at less percentage charged lol,Mini Cooper
2022-02-14,that range is garbage,Mini Cooper
2022-02-14,why are you folks in the uk starting to rate in miles vs kilometers,Mini Cooper
2022-02-10,i have seen these statements along the lines of its a smaller battery so is quicker to fill up before but they dont any sense to me all other things being equal a car with a 32kwh battery pack will take less time to fill up than a car with a 40kwh battery theres not as much to fill up but they will add the same amount of range in the same amount of time its just that you will be able to add more range to a 40kwh vehicle,Mini Cooper
2022-02-08,damn mini you should have partner with lucid for more range ,Mini Cooper
2022-01-29,the way you drive make all the difference,Mini Cooper
2022-01-28,they just look crap and a mess inside though the dash looks vile,Mini Cooper
2022-01-22,if bmw can get this to 25k before tsla comes out with its hatchback and mass market it they will have a jack pot on their hands  sadly it will be or is 23 times more expensive an difficult to scale and mass produce because the company will not adopt a true ev revolution until its too late  news flash between tsla and china right now its too late,Mini Cooper
2022-01-14,well i took this car on a test drive and i can consider myself as a car enthusiast offcourse i needed to test the real power of this mini i took it to an empty industry road and pulled the gas peddal to the floor in sport mode it took me 5 minutes of high performance driving and got a message on the minis screen telling me i only had 50 power left because of overheating so this car is useless if you really want to have some fun th range sucks btw,Mini Cooper
2022-01-12,car with the range like this is useless,Mini Cooper
2022-01-07,great review,Mini Cooper
2021-12-31,pointless test if you have everything turned off  you still dont even run it totally flat,Mini Cooper
2021-12-29,only thing more formidable then a mini an electric mini,Mini Cooper
2021-12-26,"could electric  cars be built with one of them  50 kw on board generators 
that charge the batterys on the go use a tiny amount of fuel to stop the risk of
running flat on the road away from a charging point hydrogen is a better solution
diesel cars with ad blue admit no pollution evs  are just a problem that are badly 
engineered that cause more pollution by the industrys that build the batterys",Mini Cooper
2021-12-25,ok first problem your steering wheel is on the wrong side of the car,Mini Cooper
2021-12-21,less than 100 miles of range with driver not even able to use the heater to save electricity to make the destination  utterly absurd  bmw should not be allowed to advertise 145 miles range  horrible effort by bmw,Mini Cooper
2021-12-15,in the us this city commuter has zero competition since the new fiat 500e isnt coming here dirt cheap with us and state tax incentives 23000,Mini Cooper
2021-12-11,i have a service appointment for my countryman and i am grinding my teeth to not test drive this,Mini Cooper
2021-12-04,so it corners fast because of the low centre of gravity but have you looked into the environmental impact of cornering with that much weight at that speed in terms of rubber being left on the tarmac  not tailpipe emmisions granted but emmisions none the less ,Mini Cooper
2021-12-04,yes,Mini Cooper
2021-11-29,ahhh i like the union flag break lights very nice,Mini Cooper
2021-11-28,100 miles range lol whatta waste of a car,Mini Cooper
2021-11-23,another great review rory,Mini Cooper
2021-11-18,why not put another battery in the roof,Mini Cooper
2021-11-17,hows it compared to bmw i3,Mini Cooper
2021-11-14,326kwh battery with a range less than 200miles how the fuck is that a sustainable alternative to petrol engine,Mini Cooper
2021-11-14,what was around a 24k starting price is now 28k but by the time you spec it up to a reasonable level youll be into 30k ,Mini Cooper
2021-11-12,way too many compromises i think less than 100 miles with no heating and on restricted power delivery setting equals a fairly miserable experience its really only suitable for as a second car in my opinion and even then there are much better ev options,Mini Cooper
2021-11-12,rubbish and almost useless plus those wheels look stupid,Mini Cooper
2021-11-11,sod all this bolloxsi want to just fill up and go ,Mini Cooper
2021-11-11,i really wish this car would go 200 miles if so it would be the one id want,Mini Cooper
2021-11-10,,Mini Cooper
2021-11-09,good review as usual but its lot of money just to use for a short commute and to pop to the shops ill hang onto my supercharged cooper s for a bit longer,Mini Cooper
2021-11-07,in australia elec cars are not worth a cracker true,Mini Cooper
2021-11-03,more importantly whered you get that jacket,Mini Cooper
2021-11-02,in canada it starts at 40k with a claimed range of 183 kilometers  hard pass,Mini Cooper
2021-10-31,calling it a cooper s is just degrading the brand for marketing  extra power works edition coming soon,Mini Cooper
2021-10-28,let me paraphrase his verdict for you this mini e is shit,Mini Cooper
2021-10-23,half the range of a corsa only slightly better acceleration despite having 48 max hp more less space inside and its more expensive wth were they thinking even if you give this car extra points for the mini feel it falls short to some of its immediate competition nice review though ,Mini Cooper
2021-10-20,its from 26000 and there are many better petrol cars for half the price with twice the range and with a full time heater and ac,Mini Cooper
2021-10-18,how about service cost on electric cars,Mini Cooper
2021-10-14,very missed opportunity with the name they should have called it the mine,Mini Cooper
2021-10-09,100 miles ridicious beautiful car though also those wheels look super cool,Mini Cooper
2021-10-09,perfect 2nd car,Mini Cooper
2021-10-07,this makes my wifes focus electric rated at 115 miles 185 km not seem too bad,Mini Cooper
2021-10-04,damn these might be okay in the city but where i live in canada theres only 1 other city within this cars range,Mini Cooper
2021-10-02,mines on order ,Mini Cooper
2021-10-01,i dont like how big mini cooper have become i just wish they return the old design and size with a touch of modern,Mini Cooper
2021-10-01,i came here from a bmw website it is very cheap and the reason is clear  no range what so ever this may be a good car sharing car for the city but definitely not something you can use for anything else and in a city a car is your worst nightmare no matter if its electric or not,Mini Cooper
2021-10-01,so the screen that is on every mini is a standout feature on the electric,Mini Cooper
2021-09-30,its so underwhelming its expensive with cheap products,Mini Cooper
2021-09-29,god that off yellow makes it look even worse,Mini Cooper
2021-09-29,100 mile range is pathetic,Mini Cooper
2021-09-28,one year on  mini electric now 26000 for 100  140 miles worth it and how much is that battery rplacement after eight years of cycle charge,Mini Cooper
2021-09-26,pretty crap range tbh have to say rory is a brilliant presenter,Mini Cooper
2021-09-20,haha exhausted what exhaust,Mini Cooper
2021-09-18,i called the dealer they said the real life range is about 80miles sad,Mini Cooper
2021-09-18,electric scooter can do way better,Mini Cooper
2021-09-17,that range is rubbish electric cars are not the future i bought my diesel car brand new 16 years ago the only major maintenance job in that time has been new discs no expensive battery replacement my range is more than 600 miles and can refill the tank in a couple of minutes,Mini Cooper
2021-09-16,ten years and less miles than others looks great but sad efforts  im burning dinosaur bones instead,Mini Cooper
2021-09-12,9k extra over a petrol car to not be able to have the freedom a car brings,Mini Cooper
2021-09-09,i have never had a car with heated seats and its never been a problem why are we so weak nowadays why are so many worrying about wokeness and other issues that do not negatively affect anyone except those who want to be mean to people based on their identity when we cant handleour bums being cold for the first 5 minutes of a drive,Mini Cooper
2021-09-06,we provide automatic driving lessons in a mini electric and easily get over 130 miles from a charge its my only car and what a car,Mini Cooper
2021-09-06,i drove 133 miles from lincoln to gridserve at braintree on a single charge in my mini electric and still had 9 battery charge a much underrated electric car in my opinion,Mini Cooper
2022-10-18,hmmmi wonder why rory only achieved 98 miles,Mini Cooper
2021-09-05,price,Mini Cooper
2021-09-04,it would do far more mileage as the reserve is huge on this car not that youd feel secure testing it,Mini Cooper
2021-09-04,real life conditions are always better when testing an ecars range ie heating or ac on,Mini Cooper
2021-09-02,"if anybody wants to quickly check real life range of ev its safe to say all need approx 20kwh per 100km60miles 
all other data provided by makers or some fancy but unrealistic tests are bs",Mini Cooper
2021-08-26,reality check  who buys a car just to commute  the family car must be able to do it all  cars with a range of under 100 miles are not a realistic option for anyone 50 of ev owners have a pertrol or diesel car as well which defeats the object the lack of ev infrastructure and the time it takes to recharge make evs as much use as chocolate teapots,Mini Cooper
2021-08-26,when you make a new electric car and it has a range of 160 kilometres you are already 20 years behind everyone else this is not an ev anyone should buy,Mini Cooper
2021-08-23,i live just 5 miles from a hydrogen charging point i have just ordered a toyota mirai you can stuff your evs,Mini Cooper
2021-08-15,junk,Mini Cooper
2021-08-09,an entertaining review but flawed you said you were cold and i saw 35 deg c on the dash but you did not say that this reduces the range of any ev so your 99 miles is representative only of that cold weather case to illustrate the point carwow took one 153 miles on a hot day with most of that at motorway speeds which do not help range i would prefer a much better range figure but the small battery allows the car to keep the minis chuckable nature,Mini Cooper
2022-02-24,we had our electric mini delivered at the start of october 2021 it is now almost the end of february 2022 and we are still getting less than a 100mile range there are not many hot days in the uk,Mini Cooper
2021-08-06,the best review channel on youtube,Mini Cooper
2021-07-29,why cant car producers just say this car will only do 100 miles why arent they sewed for misleading figures its straight out lying,Mini Cooper
2021-07-27,what a terrible review  the guy just sounds like he doesnt understand electric cars range and battery consumption  clearly a petrol head so stick to fossil fuelled reviewing,Mini Cooper
2021-07-24,i wish it had better range even by 50 or 70 miles,Mini Cooper
2021-07-18,over a decade and it still has a terribly short mileage on a single charge and still costs over 20000  how on earth is the government going to convince us to stop using petrol and diesel when they go further and cost less,Mini Cooper

2021-06-28,there are better ways to make a car video than just driving the car and talking non stop car video should be about the cars it should show the cars show different tests all these youtubers do is just talk non stop showing their face for 95 of the video mate if we wanted to hear someone talk non stop we would listen to a podcast,Mini Cooper

2021-06-13,i am not sure what this tells us on one day it can drive to oxford but what if this is on a cold frosty morning in jan electric vehicles are effected by temp and driving style we need more information than this report gives,Mini Cooper
2021-06-12,an electric thats a lil bit slower than the ice version whats the point then,Mini Cooper
2021-06-11,just no,Mini Cooper
2021-06-06,this thing costs 24000 gbp in the uk i just checked how much it costs here in israel 239000 ils 52000 gbp  fuckin hell this country is criminal on so many levels,Mini Cooper

2021-04-26,"i test drove one with my wife yesterday it will be a replacement 2nd car for us handling a 55 mile daily commute the car was superb to drive really fun 
were looking forward to having one it will save us nearly 6k a year than what we currently pay for tax fuel and repayment costs on a honda hrv 15i vtech",Mini Cooper
2022-04-24,was it very loud,Mini Cooper
2022-04-24,kikita278 had one since june and love it by law has to make a weird whirring sound at low speed so pedestrian hear it other than that silent but for road and wind noise,Mini Cooper
2022-04-24,1andyronly how cool how is it doing with the 55mile daily commute does it give you and your wife anxiety about recharging it i had a mini s in the past and it is my favorite care of all time but the battery life worries me i do however want to go electric i test drove the id4 by vw and it was so so cool but the mini has my heart,Mini Cooper
2022-04-24,"kikita278 absolutely no worries re range even in depths of winter you still get 100 miles with wipers lights heated car seats windows etc 
this time of year the 140mile range is usual 
it is by far the best frame for an ev its like a go kart it beats the jcw mini around a test track on a video due to its acceleration and linear power delivery no gears to change means no loss of power on acceleration 
its a really cool fun car packed with tech the l3 is the top spec but you get plenty of toys for that the l1l2 and l3 have the same power etc",Mini Cooper
2021-04-25,pure compliance car rather an egolf with more range and less cost,Mini Cooper

2021-04-03,why couldnt the beetle do this,Mini Cooper
2021-03-27,please can you test it at 70mph on the motorway with lights wipers and heaters on and see how far it goes,Mini Cooper
2021-03-16,when you said about 10 years or engineering i though maybe it will have really good mileage 140 isnt really that good and you have to choose either luxuries or range so driving in the winter would be a pain,Mini Cooper

2021-02-08,please do one on the mini countryman  dying to see it ,Mini Cooper
2021-02-07,this review makes it obvious that the reviewer has never driven an ev before ive driven a fiat 500e for 7 years the mileage is dependent on how fast you drive the temperature of the air how consistently you maintain your speed how often you break etc if you keep your speed at 45 mph or lower and break as you would in city driving you can literally drive forever,Mini Cooper
2021-02-08,you sound like youve never driven a car before full stop ,Mini Cooper
2021-10-05,autotradertv lol you can literally drive forever well you cant can you,Mini Cooper
2021-01-30,if im expected to turn off the heating and heated seats just to barely get 100 miles out of this thing then bollocks to the whole eco concept whats wrong with my 20 year old ancient honda accord does everything that the mini cant lol,Mini Cooper
2021-01-30,even for 5k its too expensive,Mini Cooper
2021-01-20,"ok so i have had my mini for about 4 months and i can now see how rory only got 98 miles first thing is never trust the range second never trust the range technically only one point but it was so important i thought id mention it twice  ok so i am a red dwarf fan you have 20ish miles after the range gets to 0 check out carwows range test to see for yourself secondly to get the actual battery percentage you need to use the trip computer when the segments go down it is about 7 higher eg at a displayed 4 bars or 50 you could actually be at 5758 i regularly get 140155 miles depending on driving style from a charge this is in normal mode with aircon on take off a bit for the cold weather as evs dont like the cold and there you have it 98 miles becomes 125130 miles actual range about 10 down on my range due to the temperature it was worrying me how anybody could only get 100miles per charge  believe me i tried once to get down to 100 miles and failed dismally

great review  i have watched it many times and it is still a good watch thanks rory",Mini Cooper
2021-10-16,thank for a true owners perspective do you still own it now still like it any new thoughts or feelings,Mini Cooper
2021-10-16,imagic16 yes i still have the mini it ticked over 1 year recently and i wouldnt swap it for anything else as far as evs go it is one of if not the most fun to drive if anything my range has increased i now use sport mode all the time and i am pushing 250 160miles i would recommend the mini without hesitation,Mini Cooper

can you deliver to india",Mini Cooper
2020-12-30,it would be brilliant if we can have the option of an upgrade on the battery,Mini Cooper
2020-12-08,i wonder what the average speed was on that trip in the electric cars the faster you go the less efficient the battery is,Mini Cooper
2020-12-07,if i had to go electric it probably would be this just because of the great dynamics i dont mind the short range there is no alternative in this class with an even comparable range to the combustion version so adjusting is mandatory anyway,Mini Cooper

2020-12-06,to say their car gets less range than advertised,Mini Cooper
2020-12-06,i cant stand the advert playing continually on radio for the mini electric i think its aimed at kids living with flat mates who 1 couldnt afford it and 2 wont have a charging point if they live in flats or shared houses,Mini Cooper
2020-12-05,he is having a laugh ,Mini Cooper
2020-12-05,for its price i would expect better range same issues with the honda e neither match the 208 or corsa e for practical daily transport nope this is a poor try mini,Mini Cooper
2020-12-04,the real problem there is the low range the car is beautiful but a min of 250mi would be the expected range if it is to get real buyers,Mini Cooper
2020-12-02,christian car for sure,Mini Cooper

2020-10-25,using high footprint lion battery makes no sense the electric car is generally a pretty nice one but the range is ludicrous  with so many companies developing proper batteries for their packs it only makes sense for mini to get serious about its battery if it wants to sell cars  being cute and good looking is not a sufficient enough reason to buy a car that cant match many others of its same size af,Mini Cooper
2020-10-22,this is a sorry bandaid effort by bmw shameful my mini ev would have 220 mile range and be 060 in the 4 second club that would be a proper mini ev sport model,Mini Cooper

2020-10-21,this is a very important note in texas where i live you couldnt drive without the ac for 10 minutes that probably brings my real range to 60 miles 100km  sorry we dont live in the age of  rvs yet nice toy if the money i no object and your driving is limited to a bicycle range oh yes the price of gasoline has been around 150 a gallon tough environment for electric cars,Mini Cooper

2020-08-30,buy a cheaper skoda instead as has a better range for less money,Mini Cooper
2020-08-29,the skoda citigoe is a much better package at a fraction of the cost it even has a bigger battery bmw electrified this bloated car compared to the original it vaguely resembles and ended up with an overpriced poor example of the type with outdated range obsolete already,Mini Cooper

2020-07-20,hey i really like you and your presentation but why drive the car like nobody will and give us a number of 98 miles no this is not logical what you should have done is to put on the heating to 20 degrees as one normally do driving it giving us this type of review with heating of wont help me out thinking of buying it using the heating during cole days and using the ac during the hot days as you well know wltp is with heating on regards andreas roger,Mini Cooper

2020-07-09,cant figure out the pricing why is it some much more than evs with much higher battery capacity,Mini Cooper
2020-07-08,way overpriced for the ultra low range  legacy car makers are deliberately adding atleast 4000 to reduce sales  keep petrol sales higher  batterys are nowhere near this expensive,Mini Cooper
2020-07-07,it seems the focus for this car has been to maintain the handling by keeping the weight low with smaller battery packs but at the compromise of range it is good to see a manufacturer looking at trying to create a fun electric car to drive and not getting obsessed with crazy acceleration speeds i think the limited range will put people off buying this unfortunately and i also think it is still too expensive for what you get,Mini Cooper

2020-06-19,the problem is that a few years into ownership during the winter this car will struggle to get 50 miles of range i think people need 120 miles of range with hvac and normal driving style as a minimum more than that is only needed if its your sole vehicle in which case phev can make more sense,Mini Cooper
2020-06-17,i think that mini did the right thing here the battery is fairly slow yes but we all know that trips over 600km can hardly be pulled of with any electric car unless you wait and charge them up which is possible but youll need some patience however having this as a second car for commutes itd be brilliant 180km of range is not a lot but definetly enough and from an ecological standpoint the mini actually does make a difference  with the small battery youll only have to travel about 60000 km to break even with co2 granted your electricity comes from a green source,Mini Cooper

2020-06-04,i think the weather affected your range more than you think  i know from myself with an ioniq28 that rainwetcold weather reduce what the gom says  it would be interesting to do the same test on a warm summer day dry no rain around say 2025c outside temp  plus the one thing you didnt mention but does the battery have active or passive managementheatingcooling,Mini Cooper
2022-02-03,well its england right so this test is highly relative,Mini Cooper
2022-11-10,it has active heat management and the battery can be preconditioned before a cold morning drive to help with range the heater extracts heat using a heat pump instead of generating it with a resistive element so the vehicle isnt as poorly affected by low temperatures as is the case with older or less expensive evs,Mini Cooper

2020-05-26,"all fair points and a good review however the range fixation is getting a bit old now 
btwwhy is it not mentioned that  petrol or diesels range drop when you change your drive settings or indeed your driving style
my old tfsi octavia vrs had a range of between 650 and 300 km talk about range difference
if the mini doesnt meet your expectations in any area there are no other alternatives available this car will sell well enough to warrant a purpose built ev platform before this decade is out

2020-05-23,rubbish car only got an overall positive review because its british the test itself wasnt very realistic either a normal person would have had their heater on nothing but a trashy compliance car,Mini Cooper
2020-05-21,thrashing the car around any car will reduce the range 100x more than the heated seats    even in the worst range ev the heated seats make no difference   my smart ev and my tesla model s 85d register no change in range with the heated seats or wheel on  ,Mini Cooper
2020-05-20,excellent effort except for range  add 100 and you have a tesla killer,Mini Cooper

2020-05-17,mini has been working on it for well over a decade yeah to finally decide overnight to fit the guts of an bmw i3 into the mini and put it on sale,Mini Cooper
2020-05-24,indeed  the i3 was a good experiment with all that carbon fibre etc but should have been improved more over its life  and then to stick the guts in a heavy mini and expect success is nothing short of moronic i loved my beemer but they have lost the plot with electric cars,Mini Cooper
2020-08-14,yeah if they have worked on it for a decade it should be a proper purebred ev instead of a converted petrol car,Mini Cooper

2020-08-28,john edwards my dads merc had one replaced every year his friend had the same battery in his car and it was fine but my dads car ate 1 battery a year,Mini Cooper
2020-08-30,john edwards have to disagree not only are you saving on fuel costs and maintenance but the extreme battery degradation youre describing is a bit of a myth many many old teslas running around with nothing like the sort of degradation your talking about batteries arent ideal in the long run at all but as a whole they seem to be the best option at the moment,Mini Cooper
2020-09-06,garymagan the thing is weve got to see what we have for the future i know french cars will have the fastest degrading battery  ,Mini Cooper
2020-09-06,darkreaperor9el haha maybe so just wait until the government starts taxing electric cars by dimensions or battery size though,Mini Cooper
2020-09-06,garymagan theyll tax them definitely also they might release green registration plates for electric cars soon not sure if thats true but well see,Mini Cooper
2020-09-25,bro are you deaf its 108 with the heat on who tf buys a mini for anything but city driving,Mini Cooper
2020-09-25,john edwards lol what are you talking about bro,Mini Cooper
2020-09-27,just a couple of things the battery has a waranty for 8 years they have extra capacity to cater for degredation 336 with 289 usable secondly you can replace individual cells so that if one fails you only replace that one not the entire battery thirdly i never get less than 125 miles 200km per charge and that isnt running it to zero i normally charge by about 20 to get only 90 miles per charge you would need to be doing 80 mph constantly or race at every light with the regen off,Mini Cooper

and on top of that he was using all the essential equipment like the air con and sat nav",Mini Cooper
2021-03-09,darkreaperor9el wheres your source for that actually apart from the 1st and 2gen leafs it seems most ev batteries will outlast the car and end up as second life storage for homes already examples of teslas that have done 350000 plus ks and still have over 90 original capacity how many cars have you had where the odometer kicked over 350000km,Mini Cooper
2021-03-09,mondotv4216 thats basically 200000 miles any honda can easily go past that obviously with regular care plus what about cold days evs would scare me in order for me to have an electric car it would need rapid charging and they need more charging stations,Mini Cooper

2020-05-15,the tabletlaptop hybrid of automobiles,Mini Cooper
2020-05-13,a very good car but still lacking in range but the tech is moving along quickly so hopefully we will see a mini electric with a bigger range,Mini Cooper
2020-05-12,dustbin on wheels,Mini Cooper
2020-05-07,clearly its being thought of as a city car and a second car the price is good too considering its a luxury car as a main car it makes much less sense though it would suit me as i almost never drive more than 100 miles in a week,Mini Cooper
2021-11-03,but then u wouldnt save much on fuel either much more suited for someone who drives 50 miles a day alot in city in my opinion except if money is no problem ofc,Mini Cooper
2020-05-06,so thats about 100 miles with all mod cons off thats pretty poor range,Mini Cooper
2020-05-03,what is this range crap we have 2 electric cars and the only time range is an issue is when i drive to the south of spain i wake up every morning to a full tank i never fill it up at a fuel station it is the most liberating experience not being at the behest of petroldiesel vendors,Mini Cooper
2020-05-01,so literally the worst electric car on the market lol,Mini Cooper
2020-04-28,temperature will affect the range i noticed 3 degc which will take a 20 hit on range,Mini Cooper
2020-04-26,great idea mini no heating in winter so you can get to where you need to go  this was the case 10 years ago ,Mini Cooper
2020-04-26,after 10 years of development the final product is a normal mini with batteries and electric motor instead of the combustion engine  they really put a lot of effort in this car a real pain in the neck for engineers,Mini Cooper
2020-04-23,did you drive it the whole time in sport obviously it would get way less range that way,Mini Cooper
2020-04-21,automatic,Mini Cooper
2020-05-15,mathew kelne no automatic is good,Mini Cooper
2020-04-21,are we just going to ignore the uk flag on the rear lights,Mini Cooper
2020-04-20,i think this is a disappointing effort by mini even if it made the 145 mile range they claim that still wouldnt be very good given that similar priced competitors like the peugeot e208 and vw id3 have ranges over 200 miles the minie has a 326 kwh battery compared to the 50 kwh and 49 kwh of the peugeot and the vw and i think presenting the fact that you can charge it faster because theres less to charge as a positive point is daft,Mini Cooper
2020-04-20,you can expect much from mini and youll find a whole hell of a lot of disappointment given what the could have done with this car  its kid glove reviews like this that make automakers think they can get away with a crap offering like that car,Mini Cooper
2020-04-19,needs 5 doors,Mini Cooper
2020-04-19,"to charge quickly isnt depending on the battery size batteries have a rating to show how quickly they can charge its the crating the hyundai ioniq had a 28kwh battery and could charge with 75kw dc that means the battery is capable to charge with almost 3c peak the mini barely makes 15c so in comparison it charges slower than the old ioniq
battery size and quick charging are 2 different things whats important for ev buyers is to know how many miles you can charge up in a set amount of time thats why if you have an efficient car that can charge fast youll get more miles in a set amount of time while still having a smaller battery that allows for better efficiency ioniq for example",Mini Cooper
2020-04-19,sobasically a very expensive that can give you a constant headache for the range although a very good car but as others commented add another theoretical 100 milesand it will be a real rival for the rest of the current markettill then i think only posh daddys girl will buy it for being up with the trend but not really useful for a normal buyer,Mini Cooper
2020-04-19,in malaysia only have 328 ev charger only some difficulty using this car but some people also buy this car or bmw i3,Mini Cooper
2020-04-18,solid review rory,Mini Cooper
2020-04-16,this car is perfect for a teenage kid to use after the parents first got their social justice quota fulfilled driving this  around town only for a couple years teenager wont be able to do a spontaneous road trip easily but still use for their activities daily and that generation is into charging nightly also,Mini Cooper
2020-04-16,surely this car is built for commuting and 50 miles each way for a daily commute seems perfectly reasonable to me will appeal to style conscious commuters id definitely ditch all those garish electric mini styling additions though if waiting 36 minutes for a recharge is too long for you and you need more range without charging  there are plenty of other evs available,Mini Cooper
2020-04-15,great review range is terrible 100mls ill bet not in cold weather ill also bet there isnt battery thermal management mini build it with 200mls battery management and it will sell,Mini Cooper

2020-05-04,vw id3 is another example  the egolf was interesting but where vw will really take off is with having designed a car specifically as an ev as rory said this is an evolution which is the problem trying to cram ev into a petrol chassis and body,Mini Cooper

2020-04-08,so bmw have been working on this for 10 years the looks are the same the seats are the same it turns off all creature comforts as it tries desperately to meet the proclaimed distance this car can do at the of the day you buy a mini for fun driving not obsessing over what you have left in the battery fact you will never drive it with only 12 left of charge but you would drive a petrol mini with the same 12 in the tank this may look good but until these big car makers admit that in reality they all know that the  magtec system is 100 cleaner and a single charge lasts for over 10000 miles nothing will ever change  if you want more info on magtec systems look into prof john searl seg generator invented back in 1964,Mini Cooper

id be all over this like a rash if the range was closer to 200 i love that its an f56 model and not lost any of its looks room or handling

2020-03-30,"completely pointless all mini have to do is
1 get rid of the idea of sticking british flag all over the car while it sold to other nations and people do not like carrying british nationalism all over the place
2 make a light very very strong over engineered 14 or 15 or 16 liter turbo engine comes standard with minimum 200 hp that can be tuned up to 300 hp with bigger turbo etc just like vw do with 14 tsi 20 tsi etc engines 
3 do not use electric steering or make a electric steering makes it drive like hell as the first gen mini did handling was amazing
4 maki it 6 speed manual or make auto transmission as good as bmw porsche etc do at least as good as vw dsg
5 do not mess up the exterior design andor turn the car into a 13 years old teen girl toy no car need to look lşike a pray those loser looking cars defined as womens car and i think this is insult women while most of the women do not buy this type of cars anyway as well as it fckes up whole marketing success of the car too while no men would buy it
they have to make a little crazy fcker performs and handles like hell but uses less fuel cheap to  buy and have good build quality as well as reliability 


electric cars makes sense for family andor daily driven cars if they have minimum 300 km range in normal driving  no like cruising in the empty highway at 70 mph without stopping at all etc commercial vehicles buses public transport etc all make sense with electric motor


however  it is so stupid to make a hot hatch sport car super car etc electric they even make goddamn 25 ton performance suvs hybrid that hybrid electric motor provides not even  10 power gain while it adds up stupid amount of weight because of electric motors and batteries extra cables etc ıt does not really do any difference about fuel consumption either  replacing those batteries etc will cost crazy amount of money which makes most of the hybrid or in this cares fully electric mini cooper completely pointless to own

2020-03-27,well i have had my level 2 car since the 16th and whilst the current situation has limited its use i can say i find it an ideal car  a 50 mile range would easily do for what we use the car for and the electric drive is perfect for the car as the instant acceleration makes pulling into traffic or overtaking easy  i had forgotten how fun a 3 door mini is to drive and having driven a cooper cooper sd cooper s and now the electric i feel the electric is the best of the bunch  as long as to dont want to drive long distances,Mini Cooper
2020-03-27,i love evs i drive an ev from 2015 so it doesnt go very far and thats ok i have a range extender that i hardly ever need but this is 2020 this mini litteraly needs double the battery capacity it has now at 65kwh this could be a practical car especially taken the fact that you will hardly pay more for a peugeot e208 zoe 52 or corsae or even a 42kwh i3 will do better camaan not good enough bmwmini,Mini Cooper
2020-12-07,old thread but you are missing the point you could tow a trailer with 10mwh of batteries obviously not in the real world and go 40000 miles between charges however it wouldnt handle accelerate or be in any way fun to drive the range and i mean real range not the overly reported 100mile thing is more than adequate for virtually all use cases you will rarely be more than 100 miles from the nearest charger so although annoying you can still make road trips for a city car you get another 150 city miles each morning yes the real range when you charge not many peoples commute is that long i would guess the trade off is that you will be driving the most fun ev available until you add another 0 to the end of the price that is a trade off i am willing to take if you want a practical car dont buy a mini buy a people moversuv,Mini Cooper

2020-03-25,"whats annoying is that we need now to be past second car status and we can be 
my year old renault zoe couldnt get below 120 miles if you rag it at 70 on a motorway in freezing rain i did this a few weeks ago in the summer its quite easy to get 190 miles in mixed driving the new 2020 model is already going further
its a primary car theres nowhere it cant go in a day
its disappointing that this wont do that so easily",Mini Cooper
2020-10-14,tim austin enjoy your zoe  we had new zoe ze50 and done 6700 miles in 4 months its a great car  did 1050 miles in 4 days with family of 4  had upto 260 miles out of zoe on one charge in summer and upto 68 miles per kwh on the flat on 25 miles trip would love a ev mini but too small range if wanted second car ev i would get honda e ,Mini Cooper
2020-03-25,add another 100 miles to the range then ill buy one,Mini Cooper
2020-05-01,they have worked a decade to make this 100 mile range and will make 200 mile car by next decade please wait for it,Mini Cooper
2020-05-06,srijishks lol,Mini Cooper
2020-06-06,augustus day tesla is already at the 400 mile mark with the model s long range,Mini Cooper
2020-06-14,lazy,Mini Cooper
2020-12-24,thestopwatchgod agree with the great range but tbh tesla looks quite ugly,Mini Cooper
2021-04-30,just buy an extra battery and you will go over 200 miles,Mini Cooper
2021-06-05,check out the curb weights of teslas and other 300 mile cars do you really want a 3600 lbs mini battery weights havent dropped enough and wont for another decade,Mini Cooper
2021-06-08,teslas are so expensive though,Mini Cooper
2021-09-04,thestopwatchgod well the tesla is built like shit and its much more expensive,Mini Cooper
2020-03-24,this be opening up in front of a forza horizon 4 player house clearly,Mini Cooper
2020-03-24,i love this car for its 73 second 060 time i couldnt give a damn about the range cant remember the last time i went 100 miles without an hour break,Mini Cooper
2020-03-31,and the 030 is better than the gas car,Mini Cooper
2020-04-01,alexdubois6585 ya exactly  cant wait to test drive one ,Mini Cooper
2020-03-24,very disappointed about the range thanks for the review i always love the look of that car but i always put efficiency over looks,Mini Cooper
2020-03-24,wow,Mini Cooper
2020-03-24,like there would be in a petrol car bruh my car has a turbo petrol engine and i can get 500 miles on a tank 98 miles is terrible even by ev standards,Mini Cooper
2020-03-24,great little second car if youre flush,Mini Cooper
2020-03-23,maybe you should switch off the headlamps during the day,Mini Cooper
2020-03-23,interesting review however having seen other reviews reach 100130 miles i feel that where you drive it makes a difference too historically with maximum regeneration on the brakes electric cars do better in towns and cities this is due to the need to start and stop and brake more regularly thus generating more electric current from the brakes i would love to see how many laps of a real track these cars can do with the constant need for acceleration and intense braking it should really put an electric car to the test,Mini Cooper
2020-04-29,yes and petrolelectric hybrids exhibit the same feature in urban areas with regen braking while minis are a classic design the last time i drove one was when i learnt to drive a few years ago and probably wouldnt want to buy one the point not mentioned is that manufacturing the electric  version will assist bmw with its quota of reducing co2 emissions and many of the components are the same as in other bmw models,Mini Cooper
2020-06-09,no i dont think starting  and stopping  boosts range  i think its about slower speeds in town,Mini Cooper
2020-12-07,james stewart there is a sweet spot for range too slow and accessories heateraircon etc start to be the major drain too fast and air friction takes over power required for air friction is proportional to speed cubed so going at 30mph will need 8 times less power than going at 60mph  but you get there twice as quickly however you will use twice as much energy for the accessories when going the same distance because it takes twice as long energy lost to rolling resistance is approximately constant over a given distance regen helps but you only get back a percentage of the energy  but that is infinitely more than ice cars get  in a warmer country where the aircon is on all the time i average about 250km 155miles of total range based on recharging at about 200km125 miles and around 20 battery left,Mini Cooper
2022-01-14,well i took this car on a test drive and i could consider myself as a car enthusiast offcourse i needed to test the real power of this mini i took it to an empty industry road and pulled the gas peddal to the floor in sport mode it took me 5 minutes of high performance driving and got a message on the minis screen telling me i only had 50 power left because of overheating so this car is useless on the track,Mini Cooper
2022-02-28,lol yes sure of course lets put them on a race track if we want to find out what their real world range is,Mini Cooper
2020-03-23,thank you the best cooper se review that ive been waiting for,Mini Cooper
2020-03-23,who expects a mini cooper to je comfortable think youve got some car brands mixed up mate,Mini Cooper

2020-03-23,98 miles 24k    lol,Mini Cooper
2020-03-23,this will be more than enough range for most owners use cases  if youve got range anxiety dont buy it plenty will though,Mini Cooper
2020-03-23,nice work as always rory,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,a good car ruined by lack of range shame on you bmw,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,despite its obvious short comings you just know this will sell like hotcakes covid19 not withstanding,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,rory love ur content youve really redeem this channel ,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,as an around town car the mini has always been one of my favorites now it is still one of my favorites whether electric or petrol based models as a grocery getter quick stop or going out car they are phenomenal for long trips theres nothing like a larger vehicle that allows us to stretch out a little more,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,i really dont like electric cars,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,this mini electric really appeals to me im worried i might be gay though,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,"i do like to watch your reviews but i do not take them as objective car reviews but simply as an entertainment show because you do not give any negative feedback in any your reviews for example 99 miles of range in green plus in 2020 are you joking it is ok because it charges faster than others what does that help if you get again 99miles lool normally that others charge longer because they have larger battery and you can do more miles
i really hope you will find your pace that will be objective check savagegeese tests where he directly states and emphasies all the negatives but he is not so dependent on the car industry",Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,mtlsi i believe the car was designed for users who have short commutes so with that in mind its difficult to criticise it too much for not doing something its not designed specifically to do in the first place but i do hope the fact i showed its real world range will help people make their own minds up based on their individual requirements as for objectivity most people wouldnt have done the test in the first place  rory,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,"autotradertv thx for your answer but i have a comment mini is and was a fun car to drive this is its usp against other smaller cars so this so called real world test is a joke you should be driving it in at least normal if not in sport who would buy a mini and then use it in green plus if they can get a cheaper electric car with longer range and drive it as a grandpa  or completelly hammer it and having more fun than in a mini in green plus because they could do it since the range is longer and even without freezing  

anyway i like that you did this test and have shown that mini has really really really short range maybe next time first try to get into the shoes of a potential buyer and plan a test according to him such a test would probably be just ok for a buyer of for example renault zoe who does not care for a joy in driving and his primary target is a cheap drive from a to b 

sadly i agree with your last part that is why i do watch majority of test only as entertainment there are only a few on youtube that directly state negative issues with the cars and yes the thing that rear window does not wind down fully was a bulshit negative already in 2000 when majority of cars got ac and not in 2020 majority of them are independant from car industry that is why they can do an honest review",Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,i like it would need double the range to be any use to me though sadly,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,98miles in eco mode with no heater is rubbish imagine what it would in normal or sport  e cars have got a long way to go 1015 years yet,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,he said eco therere 4 modes ,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,thats not good i mean you drove in eco  mode without any heating and only did 100 miles look at a vw up eit does way better for less money i think mini failed with this car only think of driving with heating and in sports mode,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,if its made in china it can fk off,Mini Cooper
2020-05-15,geordiesrule no,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,turns off heating and heated seats in eco mode might as well buy an electric motorcycle,Mini Cooper
2020-09-25,yeah nothing says motorcycle like weather proof able to carry groceries luggage passengers etc might as well not comment actually,Mini Cooper
2020-09-25,noah ksiazkiewicz ah thanks ill not bother in future wasting my time commenting then,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,"727 shouldnt have used the word usable this is not the same as the capacity  go look at real world data on pod point or ev database
its really 29kwh ish a standard leaf is 326kwh
might also be worth mentioning the charge rate it can handle topping it up capacity isnt the only consideration as to it being quick to charge
nissan leaf e can handle 100kwh

2020-03-22,rory,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,this is utter rubbish you dont buy a mini to do 100 mile plus commutes not without a stop my diesel has a 100 mile difference depending on what i use it for motorway or town driving range is such a non issue you should have reviewed it for what it is a town car for school runs trips to the shops and potting about not doing cross country runs claimed mileage from manufacturers has always been rubbish,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,geezer j i think your conclusion exactly matched ours to be fair rory,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,hi rory thanks for the reply i do appreciate it this is a perfect example of you tube comments i got to about half way through the vid before commenting and rage quitting i should have given you the benefit of the doubt watching to the end before giving my two pence my apologies having now watched to the end im still narked that the focus is about the range i think this debate is sort of done electric owners dont worry about range and neither should other people ive never run out of petrol ive rarely run out of battery on my mobile phone its a bit irrelevant that said i get that this vid is for people who arent perhaps as knowledgeable about evs and you have to appeal to a wide audience i think i just wanted to hear more about your view on the car i like your presenting style and your other content is top notch all the best gareth,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,thanks for watching again there are a dozen or so other reviews of the mini electric online i didnt see the value of telling people particularly ev fans  what they might already know its great for short commutes i wanted to do something different weve also done research that suggests most people are still concerned by ev range its just a fact im afraid its always nice to know what a car can do in the real world and not what a spec sheet says so people can decide for themselves if it fits their lives thanks rory,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,autotradertv then im cool with that sorry for being a bit of a dick and not watching fully the first time i like what you do and how you do it i need to remember theres a human the other end and theyve worked hard to produce this content before firing off comments theyve pitched it this way for a reason and if that doesnt like up with my view thats on me thanks again for the replies apologies again for being one of those people this time im not that bad in real life all the best gareth,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,i like it ambient temp really affects range probably would see 145miles in the warmer months of the year,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,"i would buy this car for the looks and  for the drive but the range is a joke im really sorry the battery is too small or efficiency is too low
back to the drawing board minibmw
btw the same disappointment like the honda e that also lacks range come on old school manufactures give tesla a run for their money",Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,i hate how all electric cars have those god awful wheels stop,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,so you freeze your butt off and still get a little under 100 miles of range thats a shockingly bad effort from bmw,Mini Cooper
2020-03-22,can you please add metric units when youre reviewing,Mini Cooper
2020-04-20,thechrosty no do it yourself its not hard,Mini Cooper

2020-03-21,this is a poor effort by bmw appreciate the honest review,Mini Cooper
2020-03-25,eriknephron gfr absolutely agree and weve had five minis simply cant have this as its not a second car bmw come back when it can do 250 miles plus on a charge real world  ,Mini Cooper
2020-05-15,eriknephron gfr no bmw is a good cars,Mini Cooper
2020-05-22,its a shame too the media has been asking when is the all electric mini cooper coming to bmw executives they kept saying soon 2020 and this is all they can come up with a small 90 to a possible 100 if you dont run any of the heating and cooling system  bmw should be ashamed of this offering idu why they dont do a skateboard design for the battery pack instead of cramming everything under the backseat an add a 60watt battery id like to see bmw do that in a mini cooper countryman all4 as all electric ill buy one just compete with the chevy bolt and model 3 bmw mini just compete with the range 259300,Mini Cooper
2020-07-01,swr112 you really need that kind of range on your second car then i guess this one is not for you,Mini Cooper
2020-07-08,the medias obsession with range anxiety is pathetic  if you want to be open publish your acceleration and speed data for this journey,Mini Cooper
2020-07-10,"mskewinyc its not that simple if you want to double the range the additional batteries would add about 220kg and required 100 litres of space the heavier mass would make the car even less efficient and require stronger suspension and frame not to mention the additional cost of all of this

im happy with evs with a real world range of 100 miles do i want more yes but not if it costs significantly more whats more important than range is the price point needs to fall for evs

id much rather see car manufacturers offer mobile batteries we can rent a 50kwh pack on wheels you collect and tow at the rear of the car which gives an additional 200 miles range for the few times you do more than 100 miles a day

a car like this would work fine for many people i will soon be doing 17000 miles a year",Mini Cooper
2020-10-14,for you i guess but the good thing about cars is having the ability to go on weekend getaways youre not doing that on 100 miles only i live in ny so i guess its a little different for the us but 100 miles wouldnt even get me from brooklyn to the top of the state,Mini Cooper
2020-12-03,i have the electric mini for three months now drive average of 120 miles a day total not a problem i can do it with one charge easy just do it on green setting and it will easily do this driving 100 km maximum allowed  more range  why  do not see this,Mini Cooper
2021-10-10,wgroenen7468 not sure how true this is for this video but some viewers hate evs so much theyll find any reason to say bad things about them even if for a sizeable quantity of the buyers the range and changing performance is just fine,Mini Cooper
2020-03-21,the most efficient driving mode but the most efficient driver top it in 12 hours then the graphics were wrong as they said 80,Mini Cooper

2020-03-21,"great vid and review youve really brightened up the autotrader channel as it had been a wee bit lost 

shame about the mini electric tho it did half the mileage it predicted on a full charge in eco mode and for me it should be 15k for a one version and 18k for the cooper e

2020-03-21,as a current f55 lci cooper s owner i was excited about this and glad its kept up with the mini chic  was excited  the range is disappointing  great if you dont leave the small urban areas otherwise id be charging this daily and that will just get annoying  maybe by upgrade time bmwmini will improve the range as batteries get better and better  great review one of the best auto channels out there,Mini Cooper

2020-09-27,the range is nowhere near 90 miles i am currently sitting on 102km from 40 ie i am at 60 left that equates to 157 miles for a full charge or 126 miles if you charge when you get to 20 i honestly cant see how anyone gets only 90 miles althoughi live  in a warm country so no heater,Mini Cooper

2020-03-21,seems this mini will give you the biggest range anxiety with the intermittent range predictions and the extra third of lies they tell you it will travel,Mini Cooper
2020-03-23,lol extra third of lies,Mini Cooper

2020-03-21,tradergang we recorded this a couple of weeks ago but now were all stuck indoors why not settle in to watch our latest film on the mini electric rory,Mini Cooper
2020-05-13,can you please pin your comments so that theyre at the top,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"rory reid 743 on the upside because the battery pack is small it charges relatively quickly recharge from zero to 80 in around 36 minutes

no no no no stop repeating this talking point promoted by makers of cars with small batteries those 36 minutes of charging only add an optimistic 115 miles of range to this mini another small ev that gains say 160 miles of range in 36 minutes of charging is obviously better in every way than this mini even if when you unplug its only at 60 charge i think the citroën ëc3 would achieve that

why do you refuelrecharge a car to get where you want to go nobody is holding a gun to your head forcing you keep charging until the ev reaches 80 charge the mini driver who feels superior because they hit 80 faster than another small ev will eventually realize they have to recharge again 45 miles before the other driver

for the 1000th time time to charge to 80 or 100 is not an important metric what matters is how long you spend charging to add a given amount of miles thats a graph not a sound bite but theres no excuse for focusing on the wrong thing",Mini Cooper
2021-12-14,"thank you for posting this took me 30 minutes just to move a mini cooper electric across a street 

i kept hitting the power switch button first not the breaks",Mini Cooper
2024-07-20,second gen was amazing and then things went downhill this one is okkkk but 500 abbarth exists so why get this the countryman and the 3rd thing look like straight up chinese copies,Mini Cooper
2024-07-17,i really really want to move to an electric vehicle but their insistence on these shitty displays and stupid noises make me want to buy a bicycle and a rail pass instead,Mini Cooper
2024-07-16,"err nope  
costs 7k more than the petrol cooper  for 7k you can travel 51000 miles so whats the point  
pay more for less convenience

the general public will not buy evs unless there better  all the pro ev people already have a ev  i think the next year we will see some interesting sales figures",Mini Cooper

2024-06-14,it looks great,Mini Cooper
2024-06-14,so 190mile range  less 20 since they only recommend you charge to 80 and charging from 80 to 100 takes ages less another 10 in bad weather or if youre running the heater so thats a practical range of 65 miles go  return so basically can only drive for about an hour away from home if you want to get back the same day without charging and for this you pay over 30k think ill pass,Mini Cooper

2024-05-28,the round screen is nice quite like the look of the whole car compared to the old one  the top spec one seems to have decent range so i doubt id even consider the smaller battery  my smart 1 has theoretical 280 miles and during the winter here i got 180190 tops and my mates emini struggled to get 80,Mini Cooper

2024-05-25,looks far worse than the last iteration,Mini Cooper
2024-05-25,looks wise its not bad still a symbolic mini yes tad different but it has to considering the future of electric cars i wouldnt choose yellow though probably in black or red will look much better,Mini Cooper
2024-05-23,what an ugly car outside and inside the face is sad and depressed the rest looks like a can of metal just a blob with zero character inside the screen and steering wheel are nice otherwise it screams cheap everywhere you look that armrest is an insult to anyone paying actual money for it,Mini Cooper
2024-05-23,any car with less than 300 mile range and 150kw charging in 2024 is a flop tbh,Mini Cooper
2024-05-21,made in china,Mini Cooper

2024-05-13,that range is still rubbish catl are making batteries with a range of 1000miles yes miles,Mini Cooper
2024-05-13,my research says the glass roof is fixed it isnt a sunroof you can open has that changed it doesnt have range for me but ok if only a city driver the lack of physical controls for air conditioning was a safety issue so i will wait it out until range is double and designers actually design the interior for drivers so they return to physical controls for air conditioning tactile controls you cant look at the road and the touch screen mini dont have a lot of customisation exterior colours either i am looking at the alpine b290 as built in france just a little more exciting but nice review all the same rain is good too,Mini Cooper
2024-05-13,its a shame they decided to build in china i will not buy a chinese made car while the ccp are backing russia and allies with iran and north korea,Mini Cooper

2024-05-10,i think i disagree that it isnt a proper mini because its electric you could lose all the sound effects too please and it would still be a great little car it looks good its engaging to drive its chuckable it has personalityits a mini i do hope you can turn those sound effects off btw they would be entertaining for about 24 seconds max and then just annoying as with the various other evs that come with phoney sounds,Mini Cooper

no you wont because the government dont want you and have banned all programmes from the mines where children 
younger than 8 years old are forced to work and many never get to grow up the depreciation is so huge you will regret 
ever owning one they do not help and have not had the slightest impact on net zero if you still believe such a thing

2024-05-09,i have the mini se right now i saw the new one yesterday it looks smaller but is way nicer in the metal than the pictures suggested the interior is jarring when youve had minis for 20 years but the nod to the car i learned to drive in is spot on losing the black plastic externally makes a huge difference,Mini Cooper
2024-05-09,"nikola thanks for the review btw wrt opd

1140 the opd brings the car to a full stop

2024-05-09,"rather juvenile review of a rather average and overpriced ev lots of silly technology average looks and real range will become apparent in due course

2024-05-08,sorry but a hard no for me  rear and especially the front look awful its just lost so much character and just looks generic shame,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,"one reason i like my current mini is while not uk owned anymore at least its made in britain and supporting british jobs this electric model is made in china they say they will move some new electric production to the uk in 2026 but until then only petrol models made in oxford

honestly though i think this new version looks crap inside and out and the gimmicks cheesy rather than cool so im not tempted to swap for my current cooper 34k for an actually useful range is 13k more than i paid for mine and i dont do enough annual miles to offset the extra on fuel saving alone i dont drive much and i guess im unusual that i either drive journeys of 2 miles to the shop or 300 for work and nothing in between i also hate touchscreen controls especially on uk car where you have to operate it left handed and having to take eyes off the road even just to see your speed unless you pay extra for the hud is a massive safety concern for me",Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,i love it it is just a damn shame that we wont get it in the us until they bring the manufacturing back to england we have the orange buffoon to thank for that and his failed chinese tariffs but i cant wait until 2027 and to buy one until then i will keep enjoying my 2024 cooper se it is still a blast to drive,Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,to sum it up and like most cars nowadays we are asked to pay through the odds for it people design stuff plenty of us do not need and do not want can we have just a car a plain car without all this much rubbish sod the drive mods and then of course car reviewers spend more than half of their time reviewing all this rubbish inc fake noises to not mention all systems that every single time we start  restart the engine need to be reset as in the mean time they went back to their default mode either because a bureaucrat ordered it or the manufacturer said so and in this respect volvo is one  of the worst offenders tip for bmw rehire f stephenson,Mini Cooper

thanks also for the subtitled trigger warning about it not being a mini morris maybe nicola was just reinforcing the fact that shes not an old fart  who can actually remember them",Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,still way too expensive range is still far too short its ugly and isnt a mini its massive this is hideous the classic mini is better in everyway well apart from safety,Mini Cooper

interior is perfectly fine and the round screen is excellent especially with the head up display thats how the screen  controls should be done

2024-05-08,how are companies still getting it so wrong 190 milesin the winter good luck the charging is slow too if mini gave this a 300 mile range fast charging its a perfect car to replace small city fossil fuel cars its got such a cute face a heads up display and a rear window wiper but i will say how much,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,its easy because with the current state of technology you cant fit a battery big enough to go 300 miles in this size category,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,"you want 300 mile range in a small city car  are you nuts the previous mini had 100 mile range and people use them as a daily
the best ev is the one with the smallest battery to suit your normal daily mileage
thats means you save money on the battery you save weight too which means you go more miles per kw
we need to end this ridiculous obsession of wanting evs to do same as an ice car with a full tank its daft
with an ev you wake up in the morning to 100 battery in a petrol car you dont go to the garage every night and fill the tank to the brim do you",Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,pachy444  i have two electric cars  solar panels and a house battery so i know what im talking about if mini are going to charge that amount of money the car has to be capable of 300 miles it is a small car for a ridiculous price if the car was cheaper fine the smaller range makes sense but at this price point with the slow charging its not good enough so before you over react like a teenager maybe take a moment to think about what youre spouting off or youll just make yourself look silly,Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,here we go again  34k for a 498kwh usable battery  less than 200 miles real world range  i would have an ev tomorrow but i feel this isnt value for money,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,thing about evs is that the ranges differ entirely depending on if youre in an urban or countryside environment if youre in an urban or suburban area your range will be way better than if in the countryside fully expect this car to be a great seller for people who dont need to ferry people around all the time  live in a built up area,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,"
which ev is that you drive sounds odd my experience of them is urban driving stopping and pulling away uses far more battery than cruising country lanes in fact the best miles per kw will be in country driving where you might do a constant 4050 mph",Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,hi why not just get a bargain used mini se they are amazing cars and unless you often do more than 100miles a day the 28kwh is plenty and the car benefits from not lugging about a huge battery you dont need,Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,i think unless you re just determined to have a mini i think its going to have a problem competing with the electric renault 5 that if they stick to their pricing will be about 5000 cheaper,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,its unfortunate that new cars are all getting wider even the mini the length doesnt matter to me as much but driving down narrow mountain roads or old city streets would be much more comfortable if the car was just a little bit narrower but there just arent new electric cars with decent range and narrower bodies,Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,"lovely lively video to start with i think they did a decent job of keeping the character of the mini ot looks healthier than previous itterations of the ice minis ive seen on the road although perhaps stylish and characterful buildwise to me they still look fragile and anaemic on the outside
interior wise im not sold on the design and aesthetics i do like the originality of the round screen that is definitely different and refreshing even compared to the competition and tesla im not sold on the sounds and will likely turn it off most of the time if sound cancellation was part of the audio package i would consider it
one pedal driving looks good on first impression it even has full stop feom what ingather from this video what i have noticed recently where this mini and other evs go wrong in my view is that the rear space and boot space is too much of an after thought and then to me this mini version and its value is quickly lost i dont think for the specs and total package this cooper is valued correctly and price wise i would value it no more than 20000 euros max to me more thought could have been put into improving the rear passenger seating area and provide a far better sliding or folding bench configuration to let the owner choose seating position for more legroom or more flush bootspace design most journeys are without occupants and i use the rear seating area mainly for storage it is only an odd occasion i transport people in the back these days i think most electric cars can use a more playful compromising design of a transforming rear bench seat that can move around front to back on sliders or a near flush origami folding of rear bench or seats to accomodate a more non sound reverbing rear boot space i think that would accomodate a more fitting multifunctional use of the rear bench sitting areaspace in the 21st century ideas for example the id2all and idbuzz are putting forward and i have not heard anything about v2l or v2hg support for this mini which is a missed opportunity for future proofing this ev",Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,"a great review of a seriously interesting car thank you

the battery and range are fine for me most of the time and besides i do not want to spend a lot on liion while it seems batteries are going to improve so much the packaging and design are a sort of apple of the car world or very desirable but a bit more expensive than cheaper far eastern alternatives the size of this car suits me well as i do not want to lug things or worse still people in the back it is a beautifully judged package but just wish it was slightly quicker",Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,really cant get over the taillights theyre so unminilike this is the first time a mini has sharp edge taillights and these look daft and unfitting but thats just my opinion,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,i didnt think the rear looks too bad actually side view is similar to previous modern incarnations of the mini from the front it looks like a cartoon car a real gamble a new audience might love it they might really hate it,Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,any of artificial car noises are just purely stupid imo,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,i like the cleaned up exterior design as previous generation cars were becoming a mess its also refreshing to see the car staying small the interior looks cheap though and the design decisions are very questionable gimmicks like the laughably awful sound generator and the different themes will get annoying in about 12 seconds the fabric will be impossible to clean and then spotlit by the projector to show everyone how filthy your car is the screen is cartoonishly large laggy and needlessly complex if only they had made the screen smaller kept the lovely rocker switches and simplified the ui it would have been classy chic and functional and not this jumble of straps and cheap looking fabrics missed opportunity in my opinion tesla or volvo do it much better,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,exterior design is really blah  seems like they forgot people who buy a mini dont really want uniformity and all that shame they missed such a great opportunity  wonder if we can get one in camo that kinda hides it,Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,yes,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,"many years of experience with mini cars and as a cooper se 2023 owner heres my comments and proscons list
i will have to start with negatives because fairly they ruined the iconicretro design of their own throughout the 1980s and 1990s the british market received numerous special editions of the mini which shifted the car from a massmarket item into a fashionable icon because of the retro design understanding and since the day mini came out with new countryman and the new mini sse even the 2023 mini cooper se has the characteristic tounches everywhere exterior and interior keep reading down below 

my objective thoughts and proscons list 
pros
1 bigger battery had to be improved because even cars like peugeot 208e500e had bigger batteries than the previous generation mini cooper se 

2 the chassis is lengthened a longer chassis can provide more spacious interior and increases performance

3 growth of mirrors i think its counterdesign considering the iconic circular mirrors and iconic design language however for someone who is not very tall larger and rectangular mirrors can be considered functional as they can minimize blind spots

4 more options on customization the mini also great to see john cooper works exterior body kit so smooth

5 more horse power means better perfomance great to see

cons god im furious and dissapointed the are too many of them objectively
1 the black plastic artch trim has gone seriously those places especially if you live in cities will get tremendous amounts of small damages from other car doors and small physical contacts also where is the iconic design

2 the taillights what the hack you guys were thinking the physicalş design had never changed since 1990s and you guys not only changed the shape also abolished the union jack great britan flag and instead put a triangular cheap material chinese looking lights

3 interior the new generation automobile industry finds it right to express interior design in the most extreme way possible but if we look at the cars that have reached the timeless design language no matter what and what you will not come across such a disgraceful interior design the reason the reason is that everywhere inside is made of a single material and they are trying to look as if it is a brand like tesla no my friend this huge screen does not reflect the 1959 central speedo screen there may be people who like it but if everything is being completely electronic on a single screen including the air conditioning controls the car will be more antiuserfriendly and you will understand how useless it is after using it for a week also i dont think anyone has to like this stupidly designed futuristic steering wheel

4 interior buttons used to make you feel like youre in a spaceship or an airplane this swisting and onescreeneverything buttons are definitely less charismatic than previous minis more cheap material plastics being used and carpets everywhere making it like its only one piece carpet love to see and feels of the better quality materials on my cooper se i love them

i would be happier if i was able to see mini brand not being gay and try to shine wanting to be more popular not following the stupid path started by other brands if if if if mini used to be mini but not anymore it looks like it doesnt feel like it you also learn from your mistakes no simplicity  no good",Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,your impressions are interesting however was it really necessary for the homophobic remark in your last paragraph,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,cannygrowabeard yes i didnt mean to offend anyone try to shine was another topic sorry for misspelling if you read it that way you know when people say thats gay as a urban meaning i respect anyone but it doesnt change the mini brand people loved is being gay or being like some other brand they think they are,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,"out of all the evs on the market the only car that came anywhere near to a mini was the smart 1 and that bonkers brabus 1 version is pretty damn well good
but its good to see that mini have decided to put some proper range into a mini ev
edit  i hope that there will be a way to remove all that electric noise regardless of what mode youre in   8",Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,"having owned five with two currently on the drive in a hatch and clubbie i went to see this in november and the cooper s with sports pack sticker price was 43k and that mad if this was 24k maybe but not 35k basic and mini can certainly do basic renault 5 looks a better car truth be told the options list go on tell us the price your not in a 34k car there more like 38k shame most of the review was covering old ground we all know the interior outside looks it was driving most wanted to see

we are certainly moving away from mini with the clubbie ordered factory new 21 but my hatch one of the first f56 on the road on low miles goes on holidays and road trips when it gets used it can do 800 miles over a few days if the renault 5 retro goes same miles for 25k then its a no brainer it will drive like a mini but i cant see the renault not driving well",Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,i am generally in favor of the inside but still prefer the aluminium swithchgear and a speedo in front of me though  the new center console looks great and quite feature rich  now the outside i am just not a big fan of  the front end looks more like a toy and the back end has totally lost its identity  i am very happy i have the 2024 se and plan to keep it for a very long time  thank you for all your great reviews that really help give us the feeling of being there,Mini Cooper

2024-05-07,oh nicola too bad you didnt stay in spain until the sun came out instead of returning to rainy england this would be such a fun little ev to putz around in me id turn the sound effects off sorry one thing i love about evs is their serene relaxing quietness,Mini Cooper
2024-05-07,the outside will take some getting used to thats for sure insides lovely i wonder if theres a way to replace gocart noises with people making gocart noises,Mini Cooper
2024-05-07,the front reminds me of the nissan figaro,Mini Cooper
2024-05-07,think the sounds would grate after a few weeks and the styling from the front and sides is more anonymous than mini but theres probably aerodynamic reasons for that will be interesting to see a twin test with the ora 3 but i think id be looking elsewhere as the boot is too small for my needs,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,apparently you can switch the sounds off,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,you can turn it off unlike an annoying combustion engine,Mini Cooper

2024-05-07,you didnt say that it is chinese all the way,Mini Cooper
2024-05-07,i just think that being electric they could have chopped the front down to give it a more classic mini look,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,but if they chopped the front they would have room for the petrol engine like pretty much all bmw electric cars the minis are built to take both ice and electric drivetrains the first bmws on a dedicated ev platform since the i3 the neue klasse are due next year,Mini Cooper

its is a ground up designed ev mini which cannot take the ice drive train",Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,sorry id forgotten the new mini cooper is an ora underneath so could be a different design on the subject of the bmw ix its built on bmw clarwe platform which is also used by the new 5 and 7 series so not electric only,Mini Cooper

2024-05-07,its almost like a chinese company who didnt have permission to copy a mini copied a mini poorly its missing character lines  creases looks like a lego stand in for a mini the car has real problems with exterior design but its a climate emergency so good enough also pie plate display is daft should have nicked bmws idrive display former mini owner who didnt wait for mini to build a longer range car  glad i didnt wait btw i support small cars and efficient small battery cars efficiency and range seem right will watch for real world efficiency testing,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,it looks more like a suzuki swift,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,bmw went off the rails with their oversized beast as well what do i wish that bmw had scaled up the original by say  1015 and put all that development they wasted on the ugly i3 to build a lightweight  carbon electric mini that looked like the original and had great efficiency,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,its not a mini its just a bmw with a mini badge on it bit like the chinese mg or chinese volvo get real and be honest its good to see another small car rather than these huge things manufacturers want to push at us in china this sized car will sell for about 5000 34000 having a laugh  maybe bin the silly sounds that should save a few quid ,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,no if lego build a mini it looks like the real thing from every angle and if a new brick is need a new brick is made that car aint no mini its a german rep off and  needs10 grand taken of that sticker price,Mini Cooper
2024-05-09,colinrobinson7869 too true if it was around 19k it would sell to the masses but thats not what the germans want maximum profit for minimum effort unfortunately for their grand plan the chinese are coming in huge numbers with realistic pricing too,Mini Cooper
2024-05-09,yes thats exactly what it looks like lol i couldnt figure out why it looks so shitty ,Mini Cooper
2024-05-09,totally disagree with every point its small fun the original mini came in a number of alliterations such as riley elf wesley hornet the 1275 gt so these spinoffs are in keeping with original for city town use if able to charge at home makes sense,Mini Cooper

2024-05-08,mach1nefan ha  that text is chopped off when watching on the phone in landscape  well im so glad that shes in detention i hope she has to write it out a hundred times as well  thatll teach her    btw thanks for your time stamp oh and im glad she got soaking wet in spain    and mini should have known not to have a spanish press event mainly in the plain,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,im in detention you may have also noticed i said conductor instead of composer it was one of those days can also confirm as a kid i always just called them a morris then as an adult and now having to use the whole name when presenting it just came out as mini morris you all knew the car i meant tho,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,nicolahume yes of course but being a pedantic knowitall attentionseeking twat on youtube is one of the little pleasures in my otherwise humdrum life  coz some of us dont get to swan off to places like barcelona in the rain at least you got to sit in the car poor longsuffering manos had to stand out in the damned rain the whole time otherwise  grovel incoming enjoyed your review as usual  hope ginny doesnt punish you for too much longer leaving you on your own on the podcasts  rock on ,Mini Cooper

2024-05-07,shares a chassis with the gwm ora 3 formally known as the funky cat enough said,Mini Cooper
2024-05-07,no,Mini Cooper
2024-05-07,im watching this and worrying about the rain pouring into the car whilst you describe the dashboard  i had the same problem watching ginny talk about the bmw i5 yesterday why cant you film with the dorr shut,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,either way the window will have to be open so it makes no difference,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,its a restriction of photography  if the camera were in the car with the door closed and had a wide enough lens to capture both presenter and dashboard the image would be very distorted and the proportions would look entirely wrong  so the videographer has to use a longer lens from further away to flatten the image but that obviously requires the door to be open  the window aperture would not be wide enough to film through without some intrusion into the frame,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,i thought that as well the seat is soaking,Mini Cooper
2024-05-07,looks awful,Mini Cooper
2024-05-07,yellow is the faster color love your work i popped over to london for a board of directors meeting at wembley stadium and one of my tesla ubers was an eminni loved it we owned a cooper s here in the colonies loved it,Mini Cooper
2024-05-07,could have stayed in the uk to drive in pouring rain   love the mini number plate on that press car great to see the mini shrinking a bit too,Mini Cooper
2024-05-08,because you cant fit a  camera and a manos in the passenger seat and still have enough distance to capture the scene  if a car cant handle a bit of rain getting inside it would be a bit rubbish,Mini Cooper
2024-05-07,just wanted to be the first like  and comment ,Mini Cooper
