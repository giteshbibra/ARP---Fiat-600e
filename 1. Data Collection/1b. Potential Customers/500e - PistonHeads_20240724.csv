 Can I ask about SS and higher earner's additional benefit. I understand that between 100k and 125k of earnings for every £2 over 100k £1 is lost from personal allowance until the point that 12.5k allowance is fully eroded at 125k (or there abouts). When the personal allowance is lost you pay 20% on the 12.5k so 2.5k to pay in additional tax at 125k.So if quoted a car that is net 500/mnth upto 100k, (tusker not providing a net sum for sums above 100k), at 125k is the sum as easy as the net amount of 500 /mnth less (2500/12) 208 so the actual net 'cost' of car could be said to be  292/mnth?  Or have I got it wrong?Edited by Durhamlandy1 on Thursday 15th February 22:32
My understanding is the easiest way to work out the Net cost is take 62% from the monthly gross reduction (quoted on the tusker quote summary) and then add the BIK.  This gives you the actual effect on take home pay.That's what I did.they typically show the NET amount at 40 and 45 percent.BUT it is a higher rate in the 100-125 rate, equivalent of 62 per cent, so use that.£1,000 gross is equiv of £380 and then the BIK to add to that.I also assumed the cost of insurance and took that off as well to get the 'hire cost' of the car."

One thing I have seen with all the calculators, its like this 60% bracket doesn't exist, its secret, a dirty little tax theft secret.Alas, I am about to swap 2 days on the train into London a week to a commute to the outskirts by car probably twice a week, so with the tax above and the cost saving on fuel, it will probably make sense."

 New to this thread, apologies if this has been covered somewhere before, but not time to go through all 68 pages.Has anyone done a personal / business lease, then SS without going through one of the many (expensive it seems) schemes? We are a small business, just looking at one or two cars possibly, don't need the 'extras' that some seem to charge, so I don't see why we can't lease direct from any lease company at a better rate, then just do the adjustments on PAYE, like we do with pension. Am I missing something? Unfortunately, most info online seems to be from companies offering schemes, which doesn't help.It's worth checking out Drive Electric - they offer a salary sacrifice scheme that compares very well to Octopus and Tusker, and you can tailor the scheme to take only the bits you need, things like early termination insurance can be dropped.https://www.drive-electric.co.uk/business/services..."

I'm with Novuna and share your disappointment. Over the last 20 months i've been searching every couple of weeks and only found one ""bargain"". this was a Volvo C40 at £678 gross for 36/10k. Needless to say i ordered one and have been enjoying it for nearly a year now.I still keep a keen eye out to see and have seen zero bargains since then. The EQs were very short lived and not available on every platform (and not Novuna) and I've never seen the iX deal either but then...urgh.Thankfully i have mine until Apr 26 so in no rush. I have noticed the Ioniq 5 has reduced in price recently and about £700 gross on my scheme. Nothing else mind you"

They definitely fluctuate on ours. 18 months ago a Taycan was £650 net and now is a few kid shy of £1400. Assume it’s a mix of available deals, residuals and insurance costs (as they need to price it to cover all qualifying employees).After a test drive I wasn’t interested 18 months ago and I’m not interested now. Only decent deals are Tesla Model Y and the MG hot hatch. I wanted a Fiat 500e or electric Mini (for Mrs S rather than me) but PCP or PCH are massively cheaper. I guess the only exception would be if you were young and insurance ran into thousands per year - which was the main reason I had company cars in my 20s. The year I ordered my first one the company car tax was less than half of my best insurance quote."

Across the 2 cars, that's 13.6p per mile at today's local petrol price. Both cars are basic rate RFL, and are relatively cheap to service - £180 minor, £260 major service. Insurance is less than £250 each. One year and 2 years old, so no MOTs yet, and the 2 year old has 5 years warranty left.Currently use around 5700kwh per year, mostly during the day. Not much scope to save on household electricity by switching to a dual rate tariff.  EV charging for my mileage would add about 1700kwh per year, so still marginal whether switching would be worth it?Charging at home at the standard rate looks like it would cost about 7p a mile,  saving me 6.5p a mile, about £450 a year if all my mileage was electric. I'd save on RFL, until that changes next year? I'd save a little on servicing, but looks like EVs are a lot more to insure now?There's the up-front ""cost to change"", and the cost of getting a charger installed unless I just run a 13A extension lead from the garage.It really doesn't seem to make sense to go electric until I'm forced to."

The charger and install was £1K.My night rate tariff is 7.5p for the whole house so can be used for car charging and other heavy usage stuff like washing and drying.  I might even install a couple of storage heaters if i can find some used ones.  I did not really buy the EV for economic reasons I bought it as it is superior to an ICE.  I like the quiteness and rapid acceleration at normal driving speeds.   Mine only weighs 1400kg so is quite nimble too and as this tis PH I'm looking at some point to modify the suspension for improved handling.

Yes I'm fully aware of their history but when Henry Ford developed the Model T it effectively killed off the personal EV market which up to that point had been developing albeit slowly.The level of investment in BEVs in the interim has been an utter tiny percentage of ICE investment.So in terms of scale we are at the beginning of that journey.

 You are correct.  Motor manufactures tend to focus on their main market and not fringe requirements especially EVs which are at the beginning of their development journey being forced into widespread usage by legislation .  EFAThe first electric car (1832) predates the first combustion engined car (1864). Electric cars are a long, long way along their development journey. That's now how the world works.If you just think about what you said for a few seconds.In the Jurassic period a velociraptor accidently nudged a smooth stone down a slope - hence, the wheel has been 'in development' for 150 million years But of course, from our perspective, nothing is truly in development unless it's being actively developed. For the longest part of the history of the car, no real development of electric cars took place at all."

 OK pal, well EVs are not for you, thanks for posting, bye.ooooooooohhhhhhhhhh! Ok pal, this thread's not for you, bye! OP, when you say the EV price is getting parity with the ice equivalent, do you mean that, ie on a secondhad car, just the purchase price, or overall costs? Because you are mentioning replacing both cars? I still think an ""equivalent EV"" is more pricey to buy secondhand than an ice equivalent, but it is getting closer, not least that demand is lower for 2nd hand EV vs a 2nd hand ice at the mo. The Evs are a bit depressed price wise as a result, whereas the cost of euro 5 diesels and petrols seems absolutley bonkers to me. But if it doesnt pan out cost wise, unless you want a change or a newer car etc, the answer is obvious, stick with what you got."

Replacing the big car will likely be the more expensive option, so if it were me I’d look at the smaller car - e-UP, i3, Fiat 500 electric etc might be interesting,"

 There's over 100 Honda E on Autotrader, and the cheapest is a '20 reg at £24k. With its size and low range, they'd need to be good, because there are plenty of alternatives such as Nissan Leaf, VW eGolf and Up, and Fiat 500e, some even newer, for under £20k.Yes those prices are still very high, lots of dealers living in lala land with £30k+ listings."

 The Honda E is an urban car - not a mile muncher.  It works best in cities / towns / conurbations, hence it has a small, light battery.Not for everyone, but will work for some usage patterns.Yeah, true; when I was leasing a cheap 24kwh Leaf as a third car for a city runabout, it worked great for that reason. But I think now the Honda-e is too expensive for its range, which is presumably why Honda are no longer making them. I mean, apart from the looks, it would be far more sensible to lease/buy a cheap Zoe which has nearly twice the battery size and works as both a city runabout and a normal car."

I'm now not sure....I'm sure I saw an article last year which said it was no longer in production. Looking on google, the ev-database says it is also out of production. But as you say, it is still available to order on the Honda website (but is that just old stock they are waiting to clear?). However,  that would also be a very short period of time for a major manufacturer to stop production. So maybe that information from last year is wrong, and the car is still being produced. https://ev-database.org/uk/car/1171/Honda-e"

Makes no financial sense buying one if you just want an EV. Brilliant funky design, suspension designed by someone who cared and expensive because of it. Comes with Michelin PS4 from factory! Range is secondary to the widgets and screens and clever lights and retro feel. Brown seatbelts can’t be cheap either.It rattles occasionally and I worry about getting the blue paint fixed if it ever gets damaged but other than that it’s a fun EV to own, and rare too. It seems to be a conversation starter - people are quite enthusiastic about it, even more so when you show them the fish tank Renault Zoe would be the choice for the range anxious if you’ve only got one car, but it’s boooooring. We had a 24kw Leaf and that was fine. We had a 27kw Soul and that was fine too. Pain in the arse started with trying to be too smart, buying a Tesla and thinking we could do long distances in it."

If the weather is good get the bus either north to Corralejo or south to Caleta de Fuste - neither are fabulous but either is a hell of a lot better than Puerto del Rosario even if all you are doing is going somewhere for a drink and to swim in the sea.Arrecife in Lanzarote is slightly less grim than Puerto del Rosario, but that isn't saying much.

We did an excursion at Las Palma too, but it was overcast and windy so we didn't get to see the views. We might want to visit again in the future. What was very noticeable in most of the port cities was how vibrant the 'high streets' are still. Not only cruise ship passengers, but locals out and about - with normal shops still trading. A stark contrast to the boarded up UK high streets. The cruise itself had a very budget feel to it. I'd rate it as only 'okay'. If we were to go on another one, maybe we'd spend a little more and choose something a little more upmarket. It wasn't cheap though - certainly if you add all of the additional spending. It was good in terms of having activities laid on that we could coerce our 12 year old daughter to participate in - normally she'd want to be locked up in a hotel room with a phone/tablet.Unfortunately I seem to have returned with a cold.Edited by Chris Type R on Sunday 14th April 09:14"

 After three years the current model on sale then will have superior tech, the batteries of the three year old one will be about a third of their journey into the total unknown and the cost of replacing them will still be £47m and a ride on your granny.Let's debunk this now. (Not personal to you, DA; it's just your comment encapsulated a few on this thread and in others.)ICE car engines fail, shortly out of warranty, and at four-figure costs to replace the engine. However, that is very rare. In the same way, catastrophic battery failure has been known to happen but in very small numbers and the level of risk is broadly similar to that of buying a three year old ICE and being billed for a new engine.Also, in many cases individual battery cells can be replaced rather than the whole lot. Try buying half an engine block...What's interesting is the persisting nature of this concern expressed by DA and others about better fault when we have a generation of liquid-cooled battery cars like Zoes and Tesla Model Ss that have done intergalactic mileages without complaint. Public perception remains like this despite the fact those early fears have been disproven, or at least shown to be equivalent or better than the risk of catastrophic ICE failure.The relatively large numbers of early Nissan Leafs with inferior air cooled batteries that degraded badly haven't helped with perception but it's more than that. When battery powered vehicles fail, it seems to induce a collective response that outstrips the actual probabilities involved. It's similar for vehicle fires: everyone loves a news story about battery fires but your neighbour's diesel Astra is more likely to combust than an electric car.I wonder if there were similar conversations when cars began to replace horse-drawn vehicles. Until the public become more familiar and comfortable with the tech, it's going to take a lot of gentle persuasion and PR to overcome the visceral reaction of many who hold concerns.Even when EVs reach Toyota Corolla levels of reliability, managing the perception will still really matter.Yup but it is for the very reasons you state that the consumer currently applies that part of the discount.  EVs have only been selling in any number for a few years and it will be years yet before a general understanding of the durability of that battery chemistry filters through. But then that understanding won't be relevant to the newt cell chemistry. Uncertainty equals discounted perception of value. Plus, one can also consider the actual consumer demographic of the used EV buyer. They have money because they have driveways, they're educated because they aren't terrified of the new or angry over change but at the same time, they don't want new.  It's a picture painted of consumers who have money but no interest in just lobbing it about on any old crap, in other words, the worst punters to try and flog stuff to as they aren't going to be easy to hype up into a buying frenzy.  Which is exactly why manufacturers have failed to manipulate used values in their favour and there is actually some form of free market in used EV prices.  Long May that continue."

 Yup but it is for the very reasons you state that the consumer currently applies that part of the discount.  EVs have only been selling in any number for a few years and it will be years yet before a general understanding of the durability of that battery chemistry filters through. But then that understanding won't be relevant to the newt cell chemistry. Uncertainty equals discounted perception of value.

They aren't generally the group who can switch as of yet and just have to wait until those who can and who are willing to do so create the infrastructure they will eventually require.   Nor do we as taxpayers want to be paying that bill. It's a bill that the ZEV Mandate shoves firmly into the overseas car manufacturers who if they want to maintain access to the highly lucrative U.K. consumer market must delve into their own pockets and pay for this infrastructure because if they don't then we won't buy their goods and they're not going to get their performance bonuses. For example, if Renault want to sell EVs to people who haven't got private parking etc then the solution is in their hands. It's not our problem."

My 'fun' car is now also quite capable for long trips, so the 'sensible' car doesn't have to cross continents.  However, I'd still like to have half-decent range as the fun car may not be suitable to use in all circumstances.The EV would live on a driveway, so I'd hope home charging won't be a problem.   Driving is mixed A and B roads and Dual Carriageways / Motorways, likely less urban although it will see some.  Usage is mostly weekends going up to 40 miles each way for a walk/cycle/canoe.   It will probably see occasional  longer trips up to ~180 miles but if it could do those with a single charging stop with reasonable flexibility, that would be ok.It only really needs to seat two adults, but I want to be able to get a bicycle in the back with the rear seats down.My current petrol 'sensible' car could probably sell for approximately £15k, so if I can find an EV for that much it would be a straight swap on value, but hopefully save quite a bit on running costs and and get to enjoy the smoothness and linear response of an EV and its convenience on shorter trips - plus trimming my carbon footprint.Range, performance, handling, ride, comfort and convenience of charging are all factors although I appreciate obviously the budget means there will be compromises.I'm not absolutely going to do this right away, but I'm actively considering making the switch sometime this year.My current shortlist is:Nissan Leaf Mk2 - unfortunately the 62kWh e+ versions seem mostly above this mark, and the 40kWh seem a little short on range but worth considering. Hired one for a day and it was decent apart from charging.Renault Zoe 50kWh - good range, unsure how they shape up in other waysPeugeot e-208Vauxhall Corsa e (a less fashionable 208)MG5 - probably not, but a contender on paperHyundai Ioniq 38kWh - this is a bit interesting because it has a smaller battery but apparently gets really good efficiency even on the motorway, I've seen 170 miles at 70mph quoted.  It would also have a couple of years warranty remaining.I've mostly ruled out:BMW i3 - even the 42kWh doesn't seem to give that good rangeVW e-Golf - poor rangeKia Soul - Ioniq is better (?)Merc B-Class - far too short rangeSeat Mii - poor rangeAny thoughts on the merits of my contenders, any car I've ruled out I should reconsider, and any other options I've not thought of?"

It's pretty basic inside, but perfectly functional. The only thing I remember being a bit odd was the driving position - specifically, the steering wheel was a bit 'bus-like' i.e. tilted towards the horizontal for my liking, but hardly a deal breaker. You'd have to take the front wheel off a bike, but other than that sounds like it would be ideal. £15k would get you a higher power version. This was plenty nippy enough for daily use.

It's our only car and I will have range issues with it in the winter. I do a regular 70 mile there and back and I know I'll have to charge to get home when it gets colder.It's white goods really. I have swapped a flat 6 burbly load lugger with high running costs and a fair bit of punch, for a serene box with limited load space and very low operating costs. My bike or the wife's wheelchair fits, but the rear seats are easy to fold.I now derive pleasure from tech, the quality of the sound system, and in real terms it's quite bit quicker than the petrol wagon was. I do a low mileage, and most of my charging is done at home, utilising a clever charging point to extract as much from the solar panels as possible.A few weeks ago, I did a series of 200 miles trips, needing to charge to get home. 4 of the trips were magic and no problem. We had to wait whilst charging for 40 mins at one point, but my brother and I watched a video about the TSR2 so the time flew by. The 5th trip was a nucking fightmare, with unresponsive chargers, stupid payment systems, credit card blocking etc etc. But; I've learnt from that and it won't happen again.Plus points for me are that it fits my lifestyle to charge mostly at home so it's very cheap motoring. We live in a small village and it's great on rural roads. It can do stupid quick overtakes, and on open roads it flows down the road very well. It's a very pleasant place to be in. Great seats for medium sized people. I no longer feel I'm harming the car to fire it up for a 1/2 mile journey, no issue with cold engine!-ve points. The car corners well, but the handling is not so smooth. Despite its clever construction; because of it's relatively tall, there's a real consideration of weight transfer in direction changes. Using the throttle to adjust direction is not smooth; applying power can be a bit sudden, and lifting off needs to be done with caution as the regen will really unsettle it in mid corner. In consideration for passengers, I usually use eco-pro mode as the throttle response is softer. I'm glad I bought the I3S, it's basically a great fun box. It's major drawback is the limited range, but for us that's not much of a problem, because it fits our lifestyle."

However I do see the similarity in it being a clean-sheet small car with no preconceptions, so it's arguably a comparably bold and far-reaching small car in 2013 as the Mini was in 1959.Depreciation is a good point.  I'm initially thinking in terms of a ~2 year ownership.It looks like the median asking price of a 2020 Ioniq is £15400, while a 2018 model is £13200 (with the smaller battery).  So £2200 depreciation over two years.EVs have recently come down quite a lot in value, to me this decreases the chance that there will be further big falls in future (beyond normal depreciation).  I think a cheap EV with a half-decent range (150 miles more or less) will still be reasonably valued into the future.In terms of battery degradation I'm aware of the issues the Leaf has, at least the Mk1.  Otherwise batteries seem to be holding up well and if anything the rate of decline seems to reduce over time rather than falling off a cliff.  However this is just from a bit of quick googling.The only PHEV I'd be interested in is the Note e-Power, because that has fully electric drive.  But generally the extra maintenance of an ICE puts me off.Taycan - I've decided to invest the major part of my motoring budget in the 'fun' car, since that way it brings me most enjoyment and fun cars don't depreciate as sharply.  Hence looking for a budget EV, rather than something that will be shedding ten grand a year."

 £31k is bonkers! It is, but it's the standard electric tax. Anything electric has massive premium loaded onto it. Cynic in me says it's to gather up front a lifetime of saved servicing costs, but they will claim its development cost recouping... A gap that will conveniently not close before the fossil fuel versions are withdrawn. They will sell it to you based on lower running costs ofc."

 Why bother? classics are exempt from Ulez and you wont find a more city friendly car than a 500! They sip fuel, have the footprint of a motorbike and are easy to drive round town.Having owned a number of EVs, my experience of this drivetrain is that it is infinitely better suited to city driving, where average speeds can be single digit and there is much start stop. Air toxicity in a city centre is also a consideration. I cannot explain how much more pungent these old cars smell in London traffic nowadays.If there is an option to combine the retro design language (and proportions) of yesteryear with the benefits of an EV drivetrain - I am all for it.Like I said - I wouldn’t dare interfere with the ICE of a classic car that is centred around its engine."

 That's a good summary NB.I have also owned an LS400, and three W124s. I just love the W124. As you say, it's more old fashioned and less refined than the Lexus (or most modern cars). But there's something about W124s that I just love. I regularly drive 2x 350 miles in a weekend, and with the Lexus I couldn't be bothered - I'd just fly. With the W124, I always drive. I relish a good long trip in it. Here is the thread on my latest: https://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&...My £1,200 H plate 300E was the best though. Oa, didn't know about your 124 thread or your car. But, that 320 in smoke silver is a beauty, even better that it's got MB-Tex too, not only that, but it looks like you have the switches for heated seats too. My perfect combo would be smoke silver which is my favourite colour on old merc's and dark brown MB-Tex. Lovely car and nice thread to read. Keep it going and if you ever want to move it on, I will buy it from you no problem. High spec too with electric steering column which is very rare on a 124."

 Well TW124 that's good to hear about the w124 300d seeing as I may be parting with mine soon it's had new wings and rear arches in the last couple of years so hopefully I'll get a nice quick sale like you I had the luck of the draw Ian I think. I was very lucky with that deal. I'd have taken £200 if that's all it made. the car hasn't been taxed or insured or MOT'd since and a couple of asian lads came for it, nice guys and no problems.I wouldn't want you building your hopes up based on my deal. I keep my eyes on 124's on the web. Some hang around for ages. I've found when selling them, 99p no reserve, big juicy honest advert, lots of photos and a proper spec and appraisal and it will sell, make the effort and people make the effort to buy. Crap adverts just attract crap buyers and we all hate those sort of tyrekicking, time wasting numpties.

Has anyone here had one and run one relatively regularly? (ie not quite as a daily but using it as a main car). Best 2door shape Merc ever made imo, and a soundtrack to die for...Yes you're correct, I picked up a couple of cheap ones ( 420 SEC's ) 2 years ago when I was away on holiday £2400 for both, bought them both unseen mainly as a parts bin but they were better than I was expecting and both were and are running well even now but are in reality small project cars but not worth me doing them.I've had in the region of 25 SEC's and still have 4 + the 2 above ( 420's ). A 420, 2 x 500's ( 1 x series 1 and 1 x series 2 ) and a 560.Every now and then they pop up but I haven't seen a sensibly priced one without needing a 2nd mortgage to sort it. Some 560's command well into 5 figures with some beginning with 3!They are the same as the 4 door in reality, the way they drive and the spec and comfort. They just waft away, back in the 80's and 90's they were considered powerful cars but a VW golf is quicker now. What I have found when driving mine is that there's some sort of sense of occasion driving it, the car feels very stately, very smooth, can never describe it properly or work it out. I'm a guy who's scruffy and I don't care what people think I look like or their opinions of me and I do get some odd looks when driving around in some of my cars but these Merc's somehow make you feel a bit more important ( I am far from that by the way ) - they were used by major celebs - in fact one I have has the first owner on the records doing around the first 20k miles in it and he is known by everyone on the planet, a major music guy. If it's good enough for those sorts, I am happy just chuckling away down to the coast in my scruffs. Amusing once pulling up at a top london hotel next to hyde park in the 560 with my wife for a one night stay in my usual attire and giving the key to the valet to take it away while getting an eyebrow off him!!I don't daily them, I did do but my normal week to week driving doesn't warrant using them daily but I blast them once a month. I agree on them being a very nice looking car. Any engine is suffice but between the 420 and 560 - it's a big jump in performance. A 500 is lovely and the best all rounder I think. Buy one, you won't regret it and lets face it in these situations, if you want one, go out and get one - at worst you can flip it in a month if you don't like it.

 Do any of you threadists have reader's threads on your older Mercs?I had convinced myself I wanted an LS400 for commuting - fauxMerc looks with reliability - but the more I look at them the more I want an older Mercedes.I've had a W202 and a W203, both sold on to family members, but I think maybe a W124 or W123 is what I need as a daily driver. For me the W202 is probably the last of the proper classic styled Mercs saloons that I love.You've had a lot of really good advice already, and there is a lot of MB experience here to tap into.  I've had a 124 estate and a cabrio, a 190, a 500 SL (R129) and a 560 SEC.  Some of those cars are now owned by other threadists.  I have loved them all and still have a 1973 350 SLC: https://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&...I'd echo that a 123 might be a challenging daily but a 124 is very do-able, even now.  Do buy carefully though, they need love as they get older and buying a neglected car will cost you.  Northbrook's thread is well worth following, and you'll see from r129sl's threads that preventative, proactive and regular maintenance is key.  As others have said, buy carefully.  But - also as 0a and others have said - they are terrifically rewarding cars to own and drive.  I now daily drive (and do regular long road trips in) a 2002 Lexus LS 430 and am a big fan, but there's no doubt that driving an old Mercedes offers considerably more cred than a Partridge-esque fat Jap.  On the plus side, the LS gives one the coveted green digital clock and the DNA link with the uber-desirable SC430."

They all have a valid MOT where needed, they all get driven each month at least by me or some of my close mates and family. They are all insured and taxed.It costs me a lot of money every month keeping up with it all and time too.I've probably unwittingly created a bit of curiosity by this. I wont be doing threads, I've no interest in it, prefer to read than write but this is for anyone who loves mercs like I do.Sidenote on 124's - We are between us trying to kill a 1995 124 E220 at the moment but no matter how we bad hammer it, it just wont die and refuses to fail an MOT, refuses to break down and even on soft off road stuff the suspension will not snap or break.

If you made an EV with 1000bhp and gave it batteries for a 250 mile range, by decreasing the motor to make it only a 200bhp car will still mean it has a 250 mile range, unlike with an ICE car."

The downforce acts like additional weight, so increases the friction.  That is why F1 cars can corner at lateral accelerations greater than 1 g.Realistically most cars can't beat 0.8 g and that is on a good road with good tyres."

You could put the worlds most powerful electric motor in a car, and on a quiet run to the shops probably wouldn't be much less efficient than a very small one. I don't think the cost of building them would be much different either. Certainly not compared to the differences required in ICEBut between you and reality is a bunch of salespeople designed to function in the last century and buyers for that matter.They are selling a consumer product and they are pretty much telling the producers what performance figure to put on the packaging that will sell the product but not destroy the future sales of incrementally faster cars.There are currently massive downsides to electric cars, and the power figures need to balance that. Which is why to convince joe public to buy them they are all coming out a bit faster than the previous iteration of ICE, plus an extra power figure on top to make joe forget about the problems of charging, range anxiety and general blandness."

For my daily, I wouldn't give a st that it could do 5s to 60. What I do give a st about is that I could plug it in once a week and do a commute everyday.I guess they're trying to make EVs cool by being Porsche-beating (insert your own brand).I'd rather have an EV that did 8s to 60 but had a 1000 mile range. The range needs to be much bigger than a diesel to take into account the moronic time it takes to charge up even the best EV. 20 minutes is stupidly long. A boring diesel can get a 600 mile range in 5 minutes... including the time it takes to pay.Add the fact that it now costs the same to charge an EV in a public charging bay as it does a family hatchback or you have to put up with an 8 hour home charge overnight. Let's pause to think how many times you've set off for work and realised you forgot to plug your phone in overnight so it has 10% charge when you pick it up in the morning.

Especially in the early days of EVs when Teslas were marketing their cars. They had to have a selling point over ICE cars and acceleration was an easy selling point to make. Over in the states with lower gas prices, I guess there was less of a difference in cost per mile when comparing petrol and electric so I guess they went with acceleration as the main selling point.Carwow seem to just do drag races as filler between car reviews. I used to watch them but got tired of it after awhile. Now other manufacturers and review channels also give airtime to other more practical aspects of EV ownership which is probably more important to the general buying public."

A powerful electric car, therefore, doesn't lose range by virtue of simply being powerful with the corollary that a weedy electric car doesn't gain range simply by being weedy.  There isn't anything in particular to be gained by making electric cars less powerful, so companies generally don't.  A better motor might cost a grand or two more, per car, but that's not really a problem when consumers are prepared to pay that.  People will either want the additional performance or will be ambivalent to its presence.  A much harder sell would be a very slow electric car that doesn't go any further than a fast one and costs almost the same.  Vauxhall's appear to have had that problem with the electric hatchbacks."

The downsides of all that power are so minimal that you might as well 'let em ave it', for any drivers that happen to like it. for most drivers, it's just bloody useful to be able to dart rapidly into a gap on a busy roundabout etc.Bigger batteries equal more range.

 It's much, much easier to make a 1000hp EV than it is to make a 10 miles per kwh EV.

Significant improvement requires even lower drag coefficient, smaller frontal area and slower speeds. Or in other words, very slippery small cars going slowly.

You should ask questions and gain a better understanding ahead of deciding you're 'fed up' with something. I don't know why the power of a car you have would make you fed up anyway??There's nothing to be fed up about. Whatever EV you might buy, isn't going to cost you more because it's quite a bit nippier than the ICE equivalent. All EV's have invested more than enough in the suspension in order to handle the cars weight, the extra power doesn't add any additional burden - unless it's a performance orientated car, in which case of course you can pay more for a better setup.You don't need to upgrade the wheels or brakes (on an ICE you need to upgrade the brakes, but on an EV the brakes receive so much support via regen it's not required - unless the car is crazy fast or designed for track use). Tyres are normally the same across the range of power outputs for a model of EV, other than on the top models which sometimes have performance tyres - even then it's typically an option.If you buy a new EV and it has 250hp instead of the 160hp ICE equivalent, you really won't be paying a premium for that additional power, it's just a by-product of EV design."

I've got it all arse about face in my head and for some reason am struggling to get a clear picture if it will or not.I understand that this will give me slower warm up times (It's very very fast as it is anyway) but i'm hoping the slightly better flow, while still controled (Unlike when the stat is removed completely) will help lower temps at lower speeds.Dave!"

The smaller disc should NOT be drilled - when fully open, this is needed to block off the bypass hole - i.e. STOP the coolant just circulating around the engine without passing through the radiator.  With the holes in the smaller disc, a portion of water will now bypass the radiator when the thermostat is fully open, essentially reducing the cooling performance.A few holes in the larger disc CAN increase the amount of flow going through the radiator, although it's a very small improvement.  Making sure the cooling system is performaing as it should would serve you much better (although not as cheap!) - i.e. water pump - are all blades of the impeller intact?

I just investigated my iPace, it has a 90kwh battery but apparently uses just 81.5kwh 100->0%So it's keeping a little chunk tucked away, I would guess when it says 100% charged there are in fact cell clusters that are less then fully charged, and those clusters will be rotated each charge cycle so they're all fully cycled in turn but not all always held at full capacity - or whatever the best way to manage them is! I don't think we need to understand the science to understand that there is something more advanced and calculated occuring than us yanking the plug out when the display says '80%'."

 And for those advocating not using 100% every time, or leaving it fully charged, or leaving it at v.low charge....where does your info come from?The internet Google it a bit and it's fairly common knowledge that the manufacturers are holding back some capacity to give headroom for cell cycling. We're told we should all cycle the battery in our smart phones to avoid degradation occurring too rapidly, hardly any of us actually do it of course.. But it works and has a positive effect.All EV's have a BMS, some will be better than others but they all seek to manage the charge and discharge rate of the cells in an optimal fashion to extend their lives. It's not just the extra 5-10% headroom some EV's are known to have (I suspect virtually all will have headroom but not all are the focus of much interest so it's hard to get info), the BMS can also charge and discharge cells on the fly whilst in use via regen. It just has to keep track of the charge state and usage of each cluster of cells and it can treat them as kindly as possible.Here's some interesting reading: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/drive/mobility/art...I do wonder why some car manufacturers and experts are saying that charging to 100% makes no appreciable difference (as in the link above), whereas others say only to do so ahead of a long trip. I can only imagine that it's because it doesn't inconvenience them one bit if their customers only charge to 80% so they might as well encourage it if it makes only the tiniest positive difference in terms of battery life, residual values of their products and might even save a few battery warranty claims - that's all I can think of. But as an owner I'll charge to 100% anytime I think there's even a possibility I might need all the range, because not doing so could inconvenience me.But anyway, real world evidence shows endless old Tesla's that have been rapid charged their entire life, probably often to 100% as rapid charging is fast and more importantly free for the earlier cars, so I imagine most owners fill their boots and take all the free power they can cram into their car whenever they do need to top up.

Then on top of quite high battery deg you start with a limited range to begin with so it's not a great combo.Most longer range EV's now have more sophisticated battery management, pre-conditioning and smart and efficient temperature control via heat pumps, which is why ten year old examples are between 5%, at most up to around 10% down based on all the various factors that can influence battery life.Probably why there's no cheap 'shed' Tesla's knocking about yet.

 All are 7kW and this is enough for 99% of needs, even with multiple vehicles
 You won't get faster chargers as your home doesn't have any more spare electrical capacity. Homes were never designed for such a high demand item
 Charging sockets/cables are universal and are known as 'Type 2'
 You can have chargers with a socket which means using the cable in your car to charge at home. These chargers tend to be be smaller and neater when not in use
 You can have chargers with cables, known as 'tethered' chargers. These are like a petrol pump in that you use the cable on the charger to plug in to your car. However they can look messy when not in use (if the chargers are physically larger the cable can wrap around them more neatly).
 All have software/Apps - this just allows you to schedule charging (you can may be able to do this) and monitor consumption.
 There are around 100 chargers on the market but I have not (in 7 years) come across any that should avoided but I'd stick with the larger brands as they have the best support, if needed. Although even then it can be patchy.
 Brands - Easee, Wallbox, PodPoint, EO Charging, SyncEV, Ohme, Zappi and Hypervolt are good places to start. Perhaps avoid the BP charger as it is pretty big and cheap looking.
 Home chargers have evolved about as far as they can so don't worry about future proofing, you'll be fine with whatever you choose
Hope that helps"

 So, I got access to our portal this morning. A large employer and it is with Zenith 40% tax payer.Very underwhelmed with the cost of cars on there. I am aware of the state of the electric car market and the lack of residuals will inevitably hit the costs of the lease market. But it does seem incredibly steep. Very ordinary cars like the ID.3 and Model 3 are north of £500 a month NET.Do company portals fluctuate in price in a similar manner to personal leases? i.e if cars drop on lease loco there is a chance they will drop on a sal sac portal too?I am in no rush and I know you should buy the deal not the car, but I think I may have missed the boat on the £500/600 iX's and the various EQ's.Anyone seeing anything of interest? Not sure how your portal works but if your spec'ing the car from scratch it will cost more. I saved about £260 a month by taking a stock car when they came in. Only choice I had was the colour. happy with that to be honest. That was with Tusker.For our scheme, Tusker, the deals certainly don't seem to be as competitive as they were at the end of 2023 but I expect a large part of that is teh level of supportr from naufcaturers to shify meytal.  Year end is often a rush to clear the decks or hit targets.  At one point in December a Mercedes EQE was sub £400.For the specifc Nissan Ariya Engage mentioned above, it is currenty £397 (36 months/10k miles/metallic) with 45% tax relief on our Tusker site.  Add £34 @ 40% I think.  But an 'in stock'  Evolve trim is £437 and there are 20 of them in stock right now. It seems to me the best of, for Tusker at least, of salary sacrifce is for cars that manufafacturers are putitng money behind.  Overall though I don't think our scheme is outrageously expensive, given what's included."

 They definitely fluctuate on ours. 18 months ago a Taycan was £650 net and now is a few kid shy of £1400. Assume it’s a mix of available deals, residuals and insurance costs (as they need to price it to cover all qualifying employees).After a test drive I wasn’t interested 18 months ago and I’m not interested now. Only decent deals are Tesla Model Y and the MG hot hatch. I wanted a Fiat 500e or electric Mini (for Mrs S rather than me) but PCP or PCH are massively cheaper. I guess the only exception would be if you were young and insurance ran into thousands per year - which was the main reason I had company cars in my 20s. The year I ordered my first one the company car tax was less than half of my best insurance quote. Good to know it isn't just ours then - Taycan isn't on it at all at the moment.I am happy to stretch the man math's calculator as ours is an all in scheme in terms of maintenance and servicing.Like you, I do think if I can't make it work for me a Volvo EX30 or the like could be good for the other half, but that is knocking on £500 a month for a car with a relatively low P11dPSRG said:
 For our scheme, Tusker, the deals certainly don't seem to be as competitive as they were at the end of 2023 but I expect a large part of that is teh level of supportr from naufcaturers to shify meytal.  Year end is often a rush to clear the decks or hit targets.  At one point in December a Mercedes EQE was sub £400.For the specifc Nissan Ariya Engage mentioned above, it is currenty £397 (36 months/10k miles/metallic) with 45% tax relief on our Tusker site.  Add £34 @ 40% I think.  But an 'in stock'  Evolve trim is £437 and there are 20 of them in stock right now. It seems to me the best of, for Tusker at least, of salary sacrifce is for cars that manufafacturers are putitng money behind.  Overall though I don't think our scheme is outrageously expensive, given what's included.Yeah I think those sorts of deals are probably where I will jump in - if BM start punting iX40's for circa £600 a month net for the base car (Currently £950 with sky lounge and comfort plus, £820 bog standard msport)For reference we are showing up the Ariya Engage Pro Pilot Assist and Comfort pack (not sure if they all have this) for £444 net for 40% tax payer. So I hope our scheme is broadly competitive.Although we too (Zenith) are showing the Ariya as being available as a stock car but that doesn't give a price it gives a number to call so the price above is for ordering. But guessing a number of Ariya's are sitting around somewhere"

Rich guy whining without making any effort to explain the context of his opinion.The true stat is that in the UK 99%+ of all journeys are less than 100 miles. In other words, the cheapest current EV you could buy is more than up to the job.But of course even though it's true most of us rarely travel that far by car, there are exceptions... But even then, the occasional reliance on en-route charging has to be offset against the general ease of home charging and the cost saving of an EV.What I find weird is another stat: it turns out that 99% of those that simply don't like EV's happen to be towing boats up and down the country 3x a week and therefore can't possibly entertain anything they can't constantly refuel. It's bizarre, I've spent 20 years driving on our motorways and I hardly ever see a boat being towed - yet apparently there are millions that do it endlessly and over great distances. Perhaps they take the back roads, on their 300 mile long journeys.."

 BMW have really gotten on top of EV, easily ahead of other legacy ICE car manufacturers. It's impressive to hear they'll be making comparable profits from EV's Vs ICE cars as early as 2026, which I assume is due to their upcoming 'Neue Klasse' platform simplifying design and assembly.I think for BMW specifically, it's totally fair to say they're at the tipping point of their electric cars are becoming as profitable and their new platform is 100% electric focussed. From that position there is no holding back the growth of their EV output and commitment.I am probably Atypical but i love my i3s and would have liked to see a replacement in their pipeline.  At about 1400kg it never feels heavy and is rapid enough for most of my motoring although another 30kW wouldn't go amiss.  Range is a bit short and another 60miles would make a big difference for longer trips.   The spring/damper ratings need a rethink too.   I'm not into SuVs so will keep it for the foreseeable future.  It's only a matter of time until they can mass produce a modern i3 or equivalent and make it profitable (they built the originals at a loss didn't they?), and with a longer range.I'd assume the new platform will help with weight to an extent, in addition to incremental improvements to battery density and lighter weight panel forming etc. We should now be entering an age where EV weight starts to decrease gradually."

 I’m not fussed about people buying EVs. In the same way that I’m not fussed when people buy a whole host if ICE cars that I have no desire or own or drive. Happy to buy one myself when it makes sense, it’s just that it currently doesn’t.Let’s face it, the Toyota Corolla wasn’t the world’s best selling car because it was fun to drive. Just seems strange  to me there’s a lot of people suggesting that the current crop of EVs is a more exciting proposition than a Corolla. You have a point there. My 550hp rwd biased sports coupe EV is in no way more exciting than a corolla. My former 400hp EV SUV was also rubbish, it cost about £7 to do a miserable 200 miles and absolutely refused to roll in corners like a proper SUV.Mrs Deuce had a Fiat 500e for a while, it was about the same as a normal Fiat 500 but had an annoying habit of warming up instantly each morning and jumping into tight spaces in traffic without any drama or effort.The whole EV thing has been a dull nightmare tbh."

Nah, manufacturers asked for regulatory clarity because obviously they need to set up a supply chain and design/engineer EV only platforms for Europe and the UK (same for US and China is already a done deal). This was all confirmed alongside a truckload of EU and Governemtn funding and grants for R&D and infrastructure. “Are we ready?” Won’t even be a question come 2035.I find it funny when people come up with all these hypotheticals/epiphanies like the European Union and Uk government not to mention car companies have thousands of way smarter people looking at this. 2023 was/is a blip due to post covid price corrections, higher interest rates as well as some weak product from legacy OEMs. Not to mention some holdover of incentives to help them with 2024s 22% target. Wouldn’t worry about any dates moving, especially not with the % mandates in place. The manufacturers will be forced to compete like crazy on product and price, maybe a few weak ones won’t make the cut but it’s a price worth paying"

If the car is to become part of the trip, it has to have character - which means it needs to be more flawed than almost all the suggestions on here.I'm with these two. If your definition of the best road trip car is the best car in which to cover vast miles in comfort without feeling like you've gone through much hardship then the answer would be an S class Mercedes or similar. I'd rather do it in something daft, anything sporty would do, even if it is flawed. The three European road trips I've been on have been in a Mk2 Golf GTI, a Corrado and a rented Fiat 500. The Golf and the Corrado were very flawed machines for long distances, they weren't comfort orientated but the journeys were brilliant and the cars made it an event. The Fiat was much better at covering miles with little fuss but the journey was about the scenery along the way, the car was a bystander.If I was going on another I'd take my TVR if I could afford to feed it petrol or if I could choose something then probably something like a classic 911 or an oldish Ferrari, modern cars don't really do it for me."

I like the Honda brand and I think the E looks good outside and inside.I don't do long journeys but I hear some reviews saying the range is very poor and the infotainment UI is bad. Wondering if anyone has experience with one and if it makes for a suitable first foray into electric vehicle ownership?

For no advance payment you can get the Honda E, MG ZS 45KW, Leaf 40KW, Mini Cooper S 33KW or Hyundai Kona 39KW. The MG name doesn't conjure up anything for me and I just see it as a Chinese electric car which I guess it is, the Hyundai Kona is very ugly. The Mini Cooper has a much more powerful motor and a few more miles range than the Honda E though. I think I'd probably have to try the E and the Mini before the others.

Whilst they were playing catch-up for ICE, they have been producing arguably superior vehicles in their own markets at higher volumes than anyone would do in the UK (or indeed Europe).Whilst the MGs are indeed rebadged Chinese vehicles (from SAIC, who make and sell millions of cars every year), they seem to know what they're doing with EVs.  Quite a few interesting 'Fully Charged' reviews seem to back that up.The other brands that aren't here yet are going to be very interesting.  The Ora Cat looks to be a good competitor in the Honda E space, and is coming to the UK next year, but I'm looking forward to seeing the likes of Xpeng bringing their models over (if they do).I can't help but feel like we, as consumers, are paying for the traditional fossil-fuel brands to evolve their technology, whereas that's not particularly the case with the ""new"" car companies that have set out to make EVs.  Granted there are various moral and social concerns around EVs, not lease the manufacturing of anything in China, but it will be competition that makes everything affordable for the masses."

There are Teslas made in China, alongside 29 other makers.  The reality is that companies who made the batteries, like BYD, have found it's rather simple to just make cars instead, when that's where a lot of the cost/profit/complexity is.The basic maths of it is that there are 1.4 billion people in China, which is double the total population of Europe currently.  We're the smaller market, so they don't need to export their brand or products to get a significant jump start."

The range issue isn't an issue at all so long as it's 'enough' anyway.You get about £62.50 or so a week for your mobility needs, so you can use it for public transport/taxis etc or you can forego the money and select a car instead. Some cars need an advance payment, say for example £1500 for a 1 series BMW but quite a lot of cars don't need any down payment. Any optional extras or paint finishes have to be paid upfront too. The main thing is that you really literally only need to add fuel, screenwash etc. Insurance, servicing, road fund license, breakdown cover and even tyres are all included. It's worth mentioning that Motability itself is a charity but the money for the cars comes from an individual's benefit entitlement. Considering disabled people used to have to drive those awful Tridents /plastic pigs, I think it's one thing successive governments can be proud of.Range really is not an issue for me, the longest journey I do is from Luton to Stevenage & back which is 30 miles all round. I could probably charge a Honda E once a week and be good for mileage. Seems the popular opinion thus far is that if the range isn't an issue then it's the one to have. I just watched some YouTube videos of that Mini Cooper hitting 60 in around 6 and a half seconds thoughI think the E is certainly the trendiest and funkiest of them all, and I know some don't like it but I think that interior is pretty sweet. Just hope the seats and my spine can manage to strike a deal"

I know the Honda E has fully independent suspension just like it was on my old Civic, I always found that to be a fantastic in terms of ride and handling. I don't like firm riding cars because 99% of the time my driving is purely for necessity, it's not worth a sporty suspension for that rarest of opportunities to enjoy driving.Can I ask how you found the lack of door mirrors? are the mirror screens an easy transition? I've seen reviews say the cameras repel rain well enough and the blind spot detection is good.I'm going to book s test drive in the new year but I'm glad I've asked for advice from PHers to rule out any immediate deal breakers.

The entertainment system is one of the best on the market, only rivalled by Volvo really. It fully supports Android Auto and Apple Carplay if you prefer to use those systems too.It's very easy to drive, especially in one pedal mode. It's easy to park, with an incredibly small turning circle. It's comfortable. I have some mobility issues and find it easy to get in and out of. The screens that replace the mirrors are very good, you need to turn your head less for the side ones. I find that a rear view mirror often needs to be adjusted as my body compresses a bit in the evenings, but with a digital one no adjustment is needed.The only issue you might have is no arm rest, but you can buy one as an extra and have the dealer fit it. Oh, and the boot is very small too, make sure your equipment fits in there (or use the back seats).As for range, 80 miles in all conditions, more like 100-110 in the summer. Obviously only you know if that is adequate for you. For longer trips you can of course charge it up in about 30 minutes on a rapid charger, which you can find at every motorway service station and many other places. The Zap Map website is good for checking chargers on the routes you frequently use, and A Better Route Planner will allow you to see how practical your journeys are.Personally I had a Nissan Leaf 24 and 30. The 30 has about the same range as the Honda E and it was fine for me. Even the 24 was no problem, in fact I loved that car."

The interior mirror I didn't like in video mode but it selectable as a conventional mirror.As other have said the weak point is the range, it was below 100 miles within minutes and its hard to get away from what seems to be a very rapid move  towards empty.   One general point to make is that the whole EV experience is very dependent on the app and software.  It has taken every manufacturer, including Tesla, a couple of years to work out how to do it and to educate the dealerships.  I would avoid owning the first EV from any manufacturer or dealer for at least two years unless you really enjoy the early adopter/beta tester experience."

It proved to be annoying.  App, remote heating and similar functions never worked and the phone link / satnav  etc was generally poor.  Some of the features were gimmicky eg the video rear view mirror.   It drove perfectly well - the usual recipe of swift, silent and gregarious in a small EV. The collision avoidance stuff was awful and the main reason I sold it; driving in the cut and thrust of slow moving rush hour traffic, it would regularly insist you were about to crash, slam on the brakes and disable the controls for a few seconds - which felt very long when you were then stuck across a junction or roundabout.   Intrusive to the point of dangerous. In summary - just not as good a user experience as the faultless I3.

To a degree that we have much much more expensive EV's on order and I'm wondering why I'm actually buying something else that expensive when this does such a good job (other than range).The Mazda's came about by ""accident"" we'd orderd a pair of EV's through our business (the expensive ones - tax reasons etc), I was offered such a large amount of money for my existing Audi (due to the shortage of second hand cars) that it would have been daft not to sell it. So that left me with a two seater sports car, a large dog and a partner who uses a wheelchair. I need a runabout till the Audi replacement arrived.I was looking at shed of the week type estates that used to be around the £1500 mark.....that were now £5000 or so given the sillyness of the used car market so on a whim I looked at cheap EV leases.After going to a broker and about 6 cars in asking about lead times and availablity we changed tack and asked the broker what was available in stock for immediate delivery. Mazda MX-30's was the answer, so having googled them and figuring out the range was around 100 miles which seemed to be putting off most people - we ordered two.As a daily driver, shopping car, dog car, town car, going to the gym car I just can't fault it. The dashboard bleeps at me a lot for reasons I'm not sure why as I've still not bothered to figure out how to turn it all on or off.The funky door designs are a revelation for disabled access. The front doors open 90 degress wide and provide huge access, the seat height is ""bum"" height so you just slide in and out. Very easy to use, nice specification as standard.Go and try one, it might be perfect for you. With the added bonus that there's likely to be stock you can have at short notice.I did check and at least one model is available on Motability with £0 down, the others are no more than £500 up front for extra bits, but if you ask me, the less alarms and assistance systems that you have the better.

Wow, you're in full-on drama queen mode today! Did you even read the article?! Safety standards are increased continually. Apart from the air bag in the seats this car isn't any less safe than it was when launched. It lost out for having a lack of nannying tech and things like 'poor child neck protection in an offset frontal crash(?).The previous model got 5 stars and now it gets none and yet its essentially the same car."

If customers continue to demand safer and safer cars, the tests are going to continue getting stricter and stricter. Although I'm sure it is a tremendous money making scheme, it does have a lot of government connections and backing and was started by the UK Department of Transport, from wiki:The European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) is a European voluntary car safety performance assessment programme (i.e. a New Car Assessment Program) based in Leuven (Belgium) formed in 1996, with the first results released in February 1997.[1] It was originally started by the Transport Research Laboratory for the UK Department for Transport, but later backed by several European governments, as well as by the European Union.[2] Their slogan is ""For Safer Cars"".Certainly their report and score on the Zoe is daft and I would imagine Renault will be exploring some legal options against NCAP.

Modern cars are becoming the equivalent of paying tens of thousands of pounds to have a digital mother in law, crippled with Dunning-Kruger, endlessly nagging, whittering on about rubbish, panicking over nothing and generally criticising everything.  It's just another unfortunate area where the normal, intelligent majority are having their life invaded by an incessant need to nanny the idiots. Having cars soil themselves due to a hedge, confusing a bollard with a child or fannying about with the steering wheel when you're crossing a road marking is remarkably tiresome and distracting. Finding a well build, good car that isn't a passive aggressive, invasive Japanese toilet is becoming a Holy Grail."

 Few things here. RRS D300 is my own personal choice of family car, I'm not saying it's the best out there, I just like the look, I was keen to find a '23 model car (without the speed safety nonsense and still with manual heater controls and actual buttons) and have a good local dealer. The other issue today is if you're looking for a diesel in 2023/24, there's very little choice beyond LR product available today. Re being a farmer and making this a business purchase, that would be great if you could actually make a profit from farming! The farm struggles to make a profit most years, so the last thing I need is yet another cost to set against the farm's measly output. Pitching for a long-termer could have worked but they are generally only for 6 months and there's often compromises to consider. Mr Clarkson has never accepted a long-termer during his career in motor journalism, simply on principle and I have always admired that.Then the terms of my finance deals on my own personal cars will (and always will) remain private. I used the PCP deals taken from the LR website in this video as a simple way to show the differences in monthly cost between the various examples I used. There's no way I would ever choose a Disco 5 as it's as fugly as the X5 is and I wouldn't be seen dead in one! I hate them with a passion but have always admired the Disco 3 and 4 as being proper workhorses but, again, I've no desire to actually own one.Thanks, never thought the D5 was that bad!!"

Why didn't Harry test his own hybrid Range Rover knowing his own case use. The UK government specifically made an EV tax break and did not set a limit or cap on it. Many other countries have set a luxury tax upper limit so you don't get more off the more you spend. I also think Harry is distorting his own ownership as being your ownership, pointing to 12 sports cars in a shed as the antidote to speed as though this is the general public. Most people own 0.7-1.3 cars per household and most people don't drive as a hobby. I would also question the idea that these luxury EVs or a Hybrid are all lemons. All of the factors that Harry points out on the used EV market, over supply, dealers only wanting to sell new cars, not used ones means that a bargain can be had not because the car itself is poor."

LPG seems to be dying off. I can't plug in a car at home, so unless I move house anything I get will have to be ICE or a non plug in hybrid.The absence of private purchases of new EVs really is merely a function of pricing.  The used market shows where private individuals are willing to transact.  Used EV values are being defined by the private consumer and it's very refreshing to see.  But at the same time new prices keep being defined in the media and others by their RRP which is a wholly fabricated number, it's not a real 'price'. In the case of EVs the true 'price' is the net of BIK. So EV depreciation isn't actually as great as being made out.  It might be more accurate to contrast the 'monthly' between the two actually very disperate markets.  Conversely, we aren't being forced to buy EVs.  Manufacturers are being forced to sell them and now the ZEV Mandate is in place to ratchet that pressure up.  Manufacturers will have to do more and more to encourage consumers to choose EV over ICE.  They'll be doing snide things like trying to raise the price of ICE and backing ULEZ schemes but ultimately to reach the volume targets required they'll have to shift more and more generic, affordable utility boxes.  And we also have to be pragmatic. Car users without easy offstreet charging potential are of zero relevance between now and 2035.  They aren't the low hanging fruit over the next decade and no one cares whether they switch to EV or not.  The target market is the larger segment who do have easy home charging.  It's the largest segment, certainly among new and nearly new.  The third party infrastructure only needs to be expanded to cater for their needs.  You can't sell a product to people who either cannot afford it or who cannot use it.  Nearly 70% of U.K. households have private parking for at least one car.  Of the 30% that don't a reasonable number don't even own a car at all.  That 30% of households simply are not target customers and no one is interested in trying to sell to it as it's not remotely viable.  And that segment has an abundance of ICe choices to choose from.  Lord knows why Harry kept referring to the EV switch as a Revolution. It's no such thing and never has been.   The RRS diesel Harry has just bought will still be on the road in 2040 and being used by someone and it'll be someone for whom the use case and cost align to be the favourable means of transport. In short, don't have easy home charging then EVs aren't being aimed at you any more than new EVs are being aimed at people like me unable to take advantage of things like BIK etc.  Used EVs are what are being aimed at someone like me but that market is barely much more than a year or two old and while pricing looks OK I still need to decide whether used EV makes my life easier or better than used big cc ICE.  Which it doesn't, fundamentally for the same reasons as Harry.  Used shopping car however very massively does.  When the current shopping car I have finally needs replacing it will categorically be with an EV and that EV will simply be used until it becomes next to worthless."

Living in Canada in a downtown I have still not  bought an EV but have cars for towing and very long distances r driving abs so on.  The charging infrastructure is just not there when I set out on a multi thousand km trip.  I can find places on highway but adds huge time.Thus no long distance EV and not for towing. I use a Cayenne V8 for the latter.This leaves shopping and local city trips where performance and range are irrelevant. What matters in parkability and resistance to being left outside in very cold winters.I do have a driveway and can put in charging which solves the winter issue but the current range of EVs here consists of vehicles that are too big and too expensive.The solution for many years has been a Smart ForTwo diesel that never goes on highway and has done 21000 miles since I bought it in 2004. Not sure there is any “should” here.  I thought Harry made the case that worked for him personally, and in my case I will eventually get something like a Fiat 500e whenever the Smart dies.Edited by RDMcG on Sunday 11th February 14:38"

Relatively light for an EV, RWD, not overtyred and a bit more practical than a MINI to boot. Other EVs (Honda-e, Fiat 500e, e208, Corsa-e) also look appealing but I expect look better than they drive? I'm sure that the MINI is also a fun EV but like you say, the JCW exists and has more character and you're not limited on the range for road trips etc. I also rediscovered my love for driving in a MINI (albeit a previous generation Cooper). They ride a little firmly, are not the most refined and the boot is tiny but they're just so nimble and chuckable and brimming with character. Nice mechanical feeling gearshift too. It was also stupidly economical getting an easy 450 miles out of a 50 litre tank.I've not owned or even driven any EVs but my current Golf (1.4 TSI DSG) probably isn't a bad comparison. It's a lot quicker than the MINI, rides a lot better and is more refined but it just isn't as fun as the MINI and only gets 370 miles out of the same 50 litre tank. It's a really nice car but I'd just as soon have a long range Nissan Leaf or e-Golf to save me a significant amount of money on my commute, whereas if I had a JCW, I would probably be having too much fun to care!So if you can live with the firm ride and the small boot, I'd absolutely go with the JCW or a Fiesta ST if you want a bit more practicality (good value and available with 5 doors) and then maybe get an i3 to replace the diesel runabout a little further down the road.Besides, even if fuel prices go up significantly after the ban on new ICE vehicles, I think that this side of exotica that it's the small, relatively economical ICE cars that are going to stick around a few years longer and the bigger engined gas guzzlers that are going to become uneconomical to run first.Edited by white_goodman on Saturday 15th October 06:17Edited by white_goodman on Saturday 15th October 06:19"

The new ev seem to have ~480 litres (probably due to motor /inverter etc under boot floor). £60k buys a lot of diesel. I like the Octavia, doesn't NEED replacing. I own it. I could get a roof box to have 800l of space.However I do want an EV and I have always wanted a sports car... So I am stashing money each month for a decent deposit on an electric Cayman when they are released.

I never have traction issues in my i3s, despite the narrow tyres.  But the handling is comical, which makes it a hoot but would be nice if it did corners a bit better!  I also have an MR2 as I can't quite give up petrol but the issue I have nowadays is it's only £2 to fully charge and I get 100-120 miles.  Nowadays the MR2 costs £60 to fill up so we're comparing £6 for 300-360 miles vs £60 for 350 miles in the i3s and MR2 respectively.

 Right. But for those mundane miles, where you're stuck in stop-start traffic, or pottering along in a 50mph average speed zone - does the way the car ""feels"" matter then?I ran an errand across South London this morning (dropping some bits off to an animal shelter), which involved sitting in traffic and smashing over potholed/speedbump-laden roads in a car loaded full of boxes and bags.There was zero fun to be had, so I switched my Volvo into Pure EV mode and got on with it. No noise, no fuss, no gears, no emissions. It would have been impossible to have more fun in a 911 GT3.But the point is a daily/fun combo. A 911 GT3 also wouldn't be my first choice there either. An EV for me will never beat ICE in terms of engagement. I get they're faster, cleaner, efficient, but none of that (to me at least) makes it fun. In terms of dailying, if changing gear isn't that fun to you, get an auto with paddles. Leave in auto when you're doing those mundane tasks and switch when you want to have fun. Mk3 (or mk2, if being pedantic) Megane RS250/265/275 is a fantastic fun car. Daily it's a bit hard and crashy but manageable, I do it. Something like a mk7 GTI performance pack might well be the sweet spot for OP."

It runs out of revs almost immediately, not helped by three 1st gears, two 5th gears and a diesel like redline, it's totally gutless except for a tiny diesel like band of torque 2/3rds up the rev range that lasts for barely a nanosecond. Having slowed at a junction it can't even get moving from a rolling start in 2nd without dipping the clutch, revving it and slipping the clutch back in.And it drinks, Christ does it drink! No redeeming features whatsoever. Even the guys at SIXT said that it's the most negatively commented upon car on return, with people sometimes coming back after just a few minutes because they think there's actually something wrong with it.What an utter dogst of an engine, However the 1.2 four pot 500's I've also rented have been lovely little things, as is our 1.1 four pot Panda.Anyone else not feel the love for twin air?"

 Lots about the Fiat 500 Twin AirI'm glad it's not just me that feels like this. I found it really tricky to drive in town, mainly because the normal gearchange indication (i.e. the engine noise) was half what you'd expect. I also found I could feel each cylinder firing through the steering wheel when it was running at a steady 50 in top gear.I thought the gear ratios were far too tall, so it encourages you to drive in a much lower gear than normal to avoid bogging it down & to smooth out the vibrations, probably shoving the consumption right up.I've never driven the 4 pot, so can't comment on that. Cabin was very good though, really high spec. I can see why they're attractive as white goods buys."

 I think full EV is the only and last chance for Jaguar.  And it's a market where there is zero point as of yet in building a product for folk without money, without income, without driveways.   And then there is zero point in going after the standard German stuff on driveways. I suspect for a modest volume producer in an expensive country the only sane option is to target the market that's buying Range Rovers, Taycans, which is clearly large enough. When one considers the modern history of Jaguar as large cars, very smooth to drive and with large engines capable of delivering large levels of relaxing torque then shrinking those large engines down to 3 pot turbo screamers to meet emission and tax criteria was a nonstarter. Only pure EV delivers on brand values and expectations and as they've not been successful in selling off Jaguar this is their only sane step forward. They're still going to be hobbled by LR being the SUV arm but a big GT and some crossovers of varying size should be enough?  Especially as all the Tuareg based SUVs seem to be much closer to being crossovers now than twenty years ago when they had to try and pretend to look like 4x4s. I do hope Jag succeed as there's a great heritage there and they've spent the last 20 years either kicking themselves in the balls or being kicked in the balls by others.   It's certainly very bold deciding to build in the U.K.Agree completely. With respect to the highlighted, we have one of each of a FFRR and Taycan as daily drivers.  The Taycan will soon go, when another FFRR will arrive.  Much as I’d sometimes prefer the driving dynamics of a large saloon, the market seems to have moved on from them. Range Rovers of various sizes really are the default choice for quite a few people, which presents a further problem for JLR: the Jaguar brand isn’t strong enough to go after the very top end (Bentley etc), so Jaguar’s strategy in the ~£100k+ sector relies on it cannibalising sales from its sibling (and that sibling isn’t going to not offer EVs)."

Quite.I have a FFRR. But if it was the mid 90’s I would have had an XJ all day long.The biggest problem is that now the Range Rover goes round corners, does reasonable MPG & cruises comfortably at mororway speeds it does everything the old Range Rovers did, plus everything the XJ did as well.This ad could be for a FFRR:"

The remaining market is the S-Class, because tradition.So what could Jaguar do? No good merely copying the Taycan, because if people want one, they'll buy the Porsche. Tradition...Jaguar tried copying BMW and the same rule applied.It's really hard to imagine quite what it would take, not to produce another 'me-too' product with no real USP.My fear is that Jaguar is now damaged goods (like Alfa) and will no longer be taken seriously in the real market outside of us aficionados, however well they make it."

This is certainly one thing we will lose. Currently the engine in any given car makes up a large part of that car's character, as a petrolhead you care what's under the bonnet. Eventually though, we will care as much about the motor powering our car as we do about the one in our washing machine."

Owned one (2007 4.3 coupe), loved it, but big bills at 30k to 40k miles: I spent a lot getting my fully histories, two owner car sorted over the 10,000 miles I had it, and stuff went wrong every month. Mostly consumables though, so if this car has had clutch, brakes and suspension done recently, OK. But absolutely every part on these cars costs an enormous amount - more than Ferraris for some stuff (£600 for a single coil spring, anyone?), as you will find on the numerous threads on these here. And specialists charge almost as much labour as dealers: floating around somewhere on the AM forum is my hilarious (think thousands) quote to get the brakes replaced. When you start replacing things like engine mounts and suspension arms, as you will on a high mileage car like this, have lots of cash ready for parts, and have a local garage do the work.And the electronics are made of chocolate. Woe betide you if you need to replace a module somewhere. I did, and I wept.I'd have a convertible 4.7 version again, though. I'm stupid like that. Gorgeous looks, noise and drive.

Servicing costs was not excessive and the only 2 non service items were new brake pads and a new rear bumper because the old one sort of had bowed somehow (you couldn't really see it unless you looked and the light caught it). Nothing went wrong with it for the time I had it.However, as much as a tried to like it, I never really got on with it. They do look fantastic (mine was black) but it lacks something - 2 turbos in my opinion ! So it went after 18 months. Maybe the V12 would have been better for me ? But I can't afford one of those.

It's a newer car in real life so therefore a newer kit. I thought Fujimi would have it figured out by now. And the detail in the mouldings is very good, such as the underside for example. But the tyres, wow - they look like the mould machine came together about 1.5mm out of line. And the fitment of some part to others is terrible, such as the glass to the body, where the glass is too large and pushes it's way back out again. Fitting the body to the chassis isn't great either - the plugs for the chassis at the back are on the separate piece rear bumper, and the amount by which you need to stretch and force the body to get the chassis in ruins any thin panel lines you might have earlier created.Finally, though it's neither Fujimi's fault nor the first white car I've made.. this model got more easily grubby than any other white car I've made.Overall more a frustrating build than an enjoyable one. The photos however make it look better than it is.I only have two Fujimi kits left to build, the FTO and what seems to be their worst kit ever, the Starion.

 There were a lot of these strange overlaps in the confusion that was BMC/BL. The older ‘Farina cars significantly overlapped the various Maxi models and Morris Minors overlapped the 1100/1300 range.I'd say that neither of these really count. For the TR4 and Herald these are more like options and spec trim levels - IRS on the TR4A was a cost-option in the US market but those cars still had all the other (minor) cosmetic, interior and mechanical upgrades that the 'standard' TR4 had. Similarly the Herald 1200 remained as a lower cost, lower-spec alternative to the 13/60 but they were still fundamentally the same car. The Triumph 1300 started out in development as a successor to the Herald but long before production began Triumph realised they couldn't sell it at anything like the Herald's price so slotted it into the range between the Herald and the 2000 to compete against the BMC ADO16. It wasn't really the 'new generation' being sold alongside the old one. Same went for the Austin Metro, which was developed to entirely replace the Mini but late in development was pushed slightly upmarket and the mechanical improvements cascaded down to the Mini so the latter could stay in production as the bottom-price economy entry to BL's range. But it's not really right to say the 1300 or the Metro ever made it onto the showroom floor intended as replacements for their older counterparts. Same with Foss62's BMC examples - although common sense would suggest that the Maxi should have replaced the Farina-B models, and the ADO16 should have replaced the Minor, that was never the intention. So not a case of 'old sold alongside new'. The FWD cars were expansions of the range, not developments of it. I'm also not sure I'd really class the (for instance, Mercedes or BMW) habit of phasing in model variants on a new generation as quite the same thing - BMW had every intention of the E36 fully replacing the E30, but spread the costs across a few years by having the estate models run slightly out of step with the main range.I think the clear-cut examples are ones like the Range Rover P38/Range Rover Classic, where two distinct generations of the same model sold squarely alongside each other with the older version priced and pitched slightly lower than its replacement. Or the Renault Campus models, where the R5 Campus existed as a one-model bargain basement option alongside the Clio, and the second-gen Clio stayed on as the Clio Campus alongside the third-gen. See also Ford's habit in the 50s and 60s of stripping back the outgoing Anglia model and selling it alongside the new one as a Popular."

 Porsche 928 was intended to replace the 911, although it was a completely different car so maybe not within this thread topic.

There’s also very good deals on buying new, the drop in list price plus finance offers and other discounts brings it down to £23k ish, not a lot more than used 35kwh ones go for. Early ones were 24kwh battery, you can tell them apart easily in pictures by the headlights as it coincided with the facelift in 2017. 24s have the flat blue stripe all the way through the headlight, 35s kick up twice. Not sure the older ones are particularly good value given the reduced range (60-90 miles real world) next to Leafs and the like. Heat pump option is debatable - ideally it’s nice to have as it is a bit more efficient. Of more value if you’re regularly doing trips close to the range of the car particularly if you live somewhere colder.

So Wolfsburg have moved to doing mk8 Golf, Zwickau the ID3.They need to keep selling electric cars for fleet CO2 rules in Europe and ZEV legislation in the US, hence keep on making and selling an ""old"" model in the meantime.

The 94 Ah ones are too expensive tho..."

I have every confidence it'll do 20+ more miles in warmer weather. I have rapid chargers either end of the journey if I fall short, I think this kind of backup is crucial to your decision making. Why not trial one like I did via the EV Experience Centre in Milton Keynes? I knew 3 days in that it would work so ordered one."
Thursday 14th November 2019,https://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&f=247&t=1839532,VW e-golf,"Ended up buying a Certified Pre Owned 2016 SE just off lease with low miles.  It was  an absolute bargain, and it has the balance of all the factory warranties. We liked how it drove, and the familiarity and ease of use of it was a key factor as it’ll be a second car for the missis, who is uninterested in novelty and complication.   She only does short city roundtrips (school run mainly) of a few miles every day, so it’s not important to us about it being the “small” battery non-heat pump version; it’ll never be taken more than 15 miles away from home.  I’d say our usage profile could not be better suited to an EV.  It has the DC fast charger option so it can be fast charged in 30 mins if need be on a longer trip. I’ve also got a 240V/50A outlet in the garage, so I can install a 7.2kW fast charger at home if I need.  Anyone with a similar usage profile ended up getting a proper charger installed at home?"
Thursday 2nd January 2020,https://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&f=247&t=1839532,VW e-golf,Currently thinking about a new or nearly now e-golf to replace my 14 year old Golf Tdi I sold before Christmas.  I commute around 45 miles a day and can get free electric top up at work.  Just trying to do the sums whether better to buy outright or lease for four years.  Methinks battery technology etc will improve over the next four years so might be as easy to chop it in then.

Wife's previous car was a Fiat 500e - this is definitely a step up in all respects. Indicates a range of ~145 miles when fully charged, which is plenty for her 40 mile commute each day. Should be able to do that 3 times without charging, but we charge nightly anyway. The active cruise control is a revelation, I want it now! She loves Apple Car Play. After 3.5 years f electric cars, she never wants a petrol driven car again. In our experience, the range doesn't decrease over time, even after 3 years, the Fiat still had the same range."

I saw lease deals a while back of £200pm - am I wistfully thinking this is still attainable ? Can't be worth while with that kind of mileage. The upside is that we hope in 6 months or so a change of job brings the mileage right down.....

Safer?I guess the big part for me is this is an experiment before I need to and I quite like the idea of an electric car as a daily.  But it seems that the technology to charge is changing/advancing at the moment with many different sorts.  The Taycan has a new system which means something and is supposedly better.  But say I get a home charger for an i-Pace on a 2 year lease then buy in to the electric car premise and get something for myself will I have to change the charger?In summary:Granny charging OK if you are giving it back (lease) do what you like and what suits you over a 2 year period.If you are going to buy an electric car, run it longer and want it to retain some usefulness/efficiency over time then get a home charger installed.I think that leads me to experiment for a couple of years/year at a time (lease), try a few models see what I like and then commit to longer with the appropriate charger (buy).Thank you, it has all helped."

 However, the whole premise of ownership begins to fall apart when you try and arrange to have a 7kW charged installed at home.

Apparently these modest electrical items mean that I have to have a new fuse fitted by the local power company (and can I get an answer to when this might happen? No) before they can install the charger, as the total existing load might exceed 79A and the standard fuse is 100A. So I'm faced with the prospect of taking delivery of a car that I can only charge through a 13A socket, which could take >24 hours. I'm rapidly losing enthusiasm. Am I unusual or is this a taste of what everyone will experience? I'm sure the charger installers will bend over backwards to give good customer service but the power companies will be their usual useless selves: we've been waiting a year for them to trim back some tress which are touching their powerlines in our field!Your problem isn't really with the electric car charger. Your problem is that your house electrics are old and not fit for the future, so they need upgrading. I know that it is a hassle to bring them into the 21st Century, but houses often need upgrading for new fangled things. Just think how much of a hassle it would have been to install running water, or a WC. I'm afraid that all of our utility companies are utterly useless, electricity, gas and telecoms (but I take some solace in discovering that Deutsche Telekom in Germany is every bit as bad as BT). When I built my house, everything had a 12 week lead time, and cost an arm and a leg.One further thing to consider. How good is your mobile phone coverage? Smart meters have to have access to a mobile phone signal to communicate with HQ. If you are in a dead zone, (like I was until a couple of years' ago) that might also limit installation.I hope that you persevere. Good luck."

We're on our 2nd EV now. First Fiat 500e, just plug in each night that it's been used, every morning at 100%. Same with the eGolf now. No noticeable detriment to the battery and no worry each morning if you have enough juice. Once you have an EV, it just comes naturally. Only over the weekend with short trips to the shops we don't bother charging. It really is simple and not something you worry about."

Am I unusual or is this a taste of what everyone will experience? I'm sure the charger installers will bend over backwards to give good customer service but the power companies will be their usual useless selves: we've been waiting a year for them to trim back some tress which are touching their powerlines in our field!Your problem isn't really with the electric car charger. Your problem is that your house electrics are old and not fit for the future, so they need upgrading. I know that it is a hassle to bring them into the 21st Century, but houses often need upgrading for new fangled things. Just think how much of a hassle it would have been to install running water, or a WC. I'm afraid that all of our utility companies are utterly useless, electricity, gas and telecoms (but I take some solace in discovering that Deutsche Telekom in Germany is every bit as bad as BT). When I built my house, everything had a 12 week lead time, and cost an arm and a leg.One further thing to consider. How good is your mobile phone coverage? Smart meters have to have access to a mobile phone signal to communicate with HQ. If you are in a dead zone, (like I was until a couple of years' ago) that might also limit installation.I hope that you persevere. Good luck.Not true about ‘old electrics’. Modern houses are being fitted with 80A, often 60A fuses, because modern insulation standards should limit the amount of power needed. Little allowance for the use of EVs is being considered yet. ‘Older’ properties often have up to 100A fuses which would almost always allow an EV charger to be fitted. We have a 100A fuse but also an 8kw heat pump and the other stuff. We have an e-Niro on order but if I can’t get a 7kw charger we’ll be reconsidering. (Likewise if the EV grant is stopped, that’ll end the idea)."

 Exactly.  I can understand getting a dedicated charger from a convenience standpoint but it's hardly an absolute necessity for most.I would argue that from a practical standpoint, it is necessary to have a 7kw for an iPace. It means that whatever your state of charge, you can charge to full overnight. I do about 10k miles pa in my iPace, and I frequently need to do a big charge overnight. Plus it means I can do the vast majority of my charging overnight on E7 rates, which probably saves approx £200 per year compared to charging throughout the day on a granny charger."

 People do it but it’s not recommended to granny charge permanently, if you can get a home charger fitted it’ll be more efficient and safer (and obviously faster).Ref battery charge, keeping it between 20% and 80% most of the time is generally considered best for longevity. I charge to 80% most nights unless I know I’ll need the extra the next day.Edited by danp on Monday 24th February 18:28
You don't need to do this with the iPace, and in fact there is no feature to allow you to charge only up to 80%."

 I guess the big part for me is this is an experiment before I need to and I quite like the idea of an electric car as a daily.  But it seems that the technology to charge is changing/advancing at the moment with many different sorts.  The Taycan has a new system which means something and is supposedly better.  But say I get a home charger for an i-Pace on a 2 year lease then buy in to the electric car premise and get something for myself will I have to change the charger?The advances in charging are on the rapid charging side - putting lots of electricity in as quickly as possible while on a journey. It's not something you'd have at home. Home charging is limited by supply to your house and spare capacity after your other electrical stuff, so the vast majority will be using 7kW single phase AC. It's good enough for putting 20-25 miles of range per hour into the car (depending on how efficiently your car uses it) so enough to fill most cars overnight easily.  If you have 3 phase at home and a capable charger in the car then you can get a bit faster but not worth doing just for car charging. Fit a 7kW charger now and it'll be fine for the future."

  I've heard this said in passing. Can anyone be more precise with efficiency numbers and risk?I think the issue is more whether it's sensible to be constantly drawing 13amps from one domestic socket on the house's ring main than any risk of damaging the car. Obviously it depends how your house is set up, but if it has one ring servicing both garage and house, you can only draw 26amps total from that ring; if your car is constantly drawing half of that there's a far higher chance of exceeding the total current draw limit if you, for example, try to boil the kettle while the oven is running. Also some older sockets can get rather hot at a constant 13amp draw.If your garage has its own ring off the consumer unit and your wiring is reasonably modern, I think long-term use of the granny cable is unlikely to be a problem."

 I have installed a home charger in the same scenario as you describe without having to upgrade the 100A fuse. Mine was done by Pod Point and it has load balancing which varies the power to avoid tripping the main fuse.  Same here - jumped in with Pod Point, specced the 7kW (32a) charger for future proofing as my 330e is only 3.7kW max charge anyhow.If there's no spare slot on the board they will pop an RCD mini consumer unit of their own in there."

 This thread is music to my ears..I'm hoping to buy a used i3S in a couple of months.I did some research by looking up the webuyanycar offers on some advertised cars, and the prices are so far apart it just means that there's no trade buyers right now. So there are a few dealers with v.expensive stock. Do some dealers still have 100day limits?I have done this for years and I’ve done the same as you. In fact years ago before BCA bought WBAC I used to go to auctions and check what may be worth buying, I’d then punch the details into WBAC and see how far I should bid up to. On a number of occasions I bought a car I didn’t need because it was so cheap and then took it to WBAC as soon as the V5 had come through. I was annoyed when BCA bought WBAC as it knackered that little system.However I digress, I too have noticed a significant gap between what WBAC had valued around Christmas compared to the last couple of weeks. In cases we are talking in excess of 30k less than screen price, ok so I’m looking at 100k plus cars but…..a few months ago the gap was around 5-10k less."

7 years until you can't buy a new pure ICE car.  Hybrids will be on sale until at least 2035 so 12 years until buying a full BEV will be your only choice if buying new.  There will of course still be a huge amount of used ICE/Hybrids also available at that point.ICE and EV will use the same chips so would expect the issues to be common across all cars if they are genuinely as widespread as suggested?"

The sales guy was very chatty and we talked for quite some time about the car market in general. He cautioned me against buying electric unless I wanted to lose my shirt in depreciation. He even went to far as to say that they (dealers) are now trying to avoid electric used car buy-ins as they can't move them.Another acquaintance who owns a WBAC type business (obviously much smaller) has stopped making offers full stop on electric cars as they can't move them either and what they did have they ended up selling at a loss to get rid.Maybe the market will stabilise in time but right now is not good as a seller but perhaps not so bad for buyers.

Agreed, used (EV) prices are still too high with some way to go. Model Y is relatively new so that will be little while. Hopefully people keep leasing and Tesla keep cutting prices I also think EVs are much of a muchness. When we replace the family wagon, I’m honestly not too bothered about which one of the current crop we go with. I would like a Y, but equally happy with anything from Korea or Europe.

Its definitely not a time to be buying or getting into long leases if you can help it.Edited by wyson on Wednesday 15th February 13:05
Agreed, used (EV) prices are still too high with some way to go. Model Y is relatively new so that will be little while. Hopefully people keep leasing and Tesla keep cutting prices I also think EVs are much of a muchness. When we replace the family wagon, I’m honestly not too bothered about which one of the current crop we go with. I would like a Y, but equally happy with anything from Korea or Europe. This will no doubt have an effect on residuals.  Edited by JAMSXR on Wednesday 15th February 13:16
We can always hope that Tesla will cut prices, but if Tesla are telling us the truth about how much it's costs to make one it would appear there is no scope for anything significant. In fact with Profit,VAT,Import duty etc the current price is more than reasonable. Used car prices won't be resolved until the Electricity prices get sorted as the average used car is buying is a much different beast to a new car buyer."

 I recently sold my GT3 back to Porsche. The sales guy was very chatty and we talked for quite some time about the car market in general. He cautioned me against buying electric unless I wanted to lose my shirt in depreciation. He even went to far as to say that they (dealers) are now trying to avoid electric used car buy-ins as they can't move them.Another acquaintance who owns a WBAC type business (obviously much smaller) has stopped making offers full stop on electric cars as they can't move them either and what they did have they ended up selling at a loss to get rid.Maybe the market will stabilise in time but right now is not good as a seller but perhaps not so bad for buyers.At the moment it's like a staring contest between dealers who want to shift their EVs they're watching depreciate vs buyers who want a new Ev but are hoping for a price drop before they're forced to re-finance/move-on/replace."

I would argue that you’re likely no worse off financially with 25k to splash on a car, compared to someone who’s using a salary sacrifice/leasing scheme. Even if these people have an extra 10-15k to spend, they’re also probably thinking a used EV as current prices doesn’t quite stack up I also appreciate that EVs can/will outlast an ICE, but I would be interested to know the current first ownership tenure. Have we just encouraged people to buy and replace more often than before. I would guess that EVs have significantly increased the uptake of new car purchases, these cars are now being replaced more frequently. Seems a little counter productive, although I’m happy to capitalise on lower used prices Edited by JAMSXR on Wednesday 15th February 13:49"

They bounce a lot and take time to settle back, they’re tall and slab sided so very sensitive to cross winds, they’re hard to drive smoothly because of the regenerative braking, the tyres are like bike tyres so they really don’t drive like a normal car.

 I've previously owned an i3 and an e-up. I'd opt for the VW every day of the week. Sorry to hijack but why - I'm leaning the other way but haven't driven either. Much longer commute than the OP's daughter though. (32 miles each way)Plenty of reasons (bearing in mind that I'm comparing an early MY14 i3 with a MY20 e-up with the 2nd gen battery pack)
RELIABILITY : e-up was reliable and had zero niggles in 2 years whereas the i3 was the most unreliable car I've ever owned. It was so bad that BMW paid me compensation for how many times it had to be booked in for work. All sorts of issues, charging failures, wonky door hinges, failed motor mounts, LIM replaced twice, etc. I'm sure owners of later i3's will tell you this is better now. I'd happily own an e-up out of warranty (in fact I gave my e-up to my elderly mum and have no concerns about that) whereas there's no way I'd own an i3 out of warranty.
RANGE : e-up had more than double the range (yes, newer i3's are improved). 
EFFICIENCY : e-up was significantly more efficient therefore cheaper to run (easy to get > 6 m/kWh, see 'The Lowly Mii' thread for other owner's experiences).
REAR DOORS : e-up has normal doors not those silly ones on the i3 where rear passengers can't get out without assistance from front passengers (and be an  utter pain in confined spaces).
LOOKS : e-up is a more inconspicuous car if you value that.
DRIVING : e-up is a lot of fun to drive, maybe call this category a draw but it's better than you'd expect and doesn't suffer from the cross wind jitteriness of the i3. 
COST : e-up was £167 a month, the i3 was more than double. Just not worth the difference IMO
The main negative of the e-up is slow DC charging. For the OP this wouldn't be a problem but if you're looking to do a lot of long distance trips I wouldn't be considering an e-up (nor an i3)."

Regulations here (Benelux) have been cracking down on PHEV's year after year.Another point of consideration for her is that she can charge on a couple of locations on a weekly basis (not at home or at work), which she would utilize. A BEV with +150km range will allow her to bridge it for a couple of weeks, a PHEV with 30km would struggle.In the end she really wants a BEV and I can't blame her.But to follow on the PHEV path, are their any interesting small-ish PHEV's?Peugeot has a couple iirc?"

 As her mileage is so low, wouldn't a PHEV be a better option?It would always run on battery except for the once-a-year trip which would then not have any range/charging concerns.Not sure how it would compare price-wise: possibly cheaper? And more likely to be able to fit a tow-bar?While I see your point, her current car is now well over a decade old, so she keeps her cars long time. Regulations here (Benelux) have been cracking down on PHEV's year after year.Another point of consideration for her is that she can charge on a couple of locations on a weekly basis (not at home or at work), which she would utilize. A BEV with +150km range will allow her to bridge it for a couple of weeks, a PHEV with 30km would struggle.In the end she really wants a BEV and I can't blame her.But to follow on the PHEV path, are their any interesting small-ish PHEV's?Peugeot has a couple iirc?Sorry, can't help with that and her charging options would rule out the PHEV anyway, as you say. Plus it's just struck me that using a PHEV in battery-only mode for long periods may not be good for the reliability of the ICE."

There are also challenges - higher weight and lack of a naturally engaging noise.So future hot hatches will be different from those we've known historically, but that doesn't mean the genre will be extinguished.The well-received Hyundai Ioniq 5 N is a good recent example (albeit a bit oversized); the Mini E, BMW i3 and Fiat 500e are all examples, but we're still very early in the electric hot hatch story."

Not helped by huge deals on new ones in the last few months.The wife of a Tesla owning friend has just swapped her Fiat 500e for a new e-Tron GT, both company cars for her small retail business.

There’s nothing wrong with how the Ioniq and the Prius look, except for the taxi connotations. But if it doesn't bother you then the Ioniq is great and a solid choice.Have you checked out the e-Golf? they can be had cheaply and are really quite good value used. You can pick up a second hand Mark 7.5 for about 12 grand, they have a 36kWh battery with a claimed range of 186 miles. They have a rapid charge feature 0-80% in 40 minutes which is reasonable for 12 grand. They’re actually cheaper than ICE golfs now with auto boxes!Edited by V 02 on Sunday 7th May 14:05"

Main warranty on the '21 VAG products will be up in a year and they don't have the best reputation for reliability particularly infotainment. BMW warranty also 3 years although the seem a bit better recently. Stellatis the same but reputation for getting no where near claimed range, particularly in winter, is less great.At higher mileage (more than 12m old or more than 10k miles) almost EVERY vehicle I looked at had missed or at least very late services which potentially could have issues with the drive train and other warranties. Probably not but at 15k or so do a new battery not being 100% sure of warranty was a concern for us.Ioniq much cheaper than the SUVs. Ioniq and Niro on same chassis so not a more modem vehicle at all... And you have to like SUVs and their compromises.Leaf Chademo connector is outdated an could potentially be an issue some point soon. Not very efficient, inferior warranty, much older tech than ioniq, reliability not great.Zoe was just too small. 22kw ac charging a plus and warranty is 5 years on these if early but 3  again more recently. Reliability not as good.With modern cars it isn't just the battery and drive system that has the potential for big bills, another 4.5y main warranty was a big plus for us.  Although a M3 appealed (apart from lack of hatchback) potential for big out of warranty cost made sensible win out for usEdited by mclwanB on Sunday 7th May 20:56"

Headroom in the back is very poor, and the lack of height adjustability in the seat is not good. Seats have very little lateral support and the rear seats are like a church pew. Neither is there a drivers armrest, a £150 extra..Typical Renault quirks as well like complicated steering wheel controls just to to toggle audio volume.But overall I thought the “new” Zoe was not a bad little car, it drove well and visibility was not bad. As a cheap EV it’s quite good. I was getting around 195 miles on a charge which I thought wasn’t too bad. I was impressed with the interior quality. All the knobs and switches felt high quality as did the general fit and finish, like the leatherette on the dash and the interesting headlining. Much better than Clios of old.I had the “Iconic” trim car and used it as a daily for 8 weeks.But maybe you’re right the Ioniq is probably much better as a “car” for the money if you can live with the reduced rangeThere’s no denying how good VFM a used Ioniq is.I’m still not sure I would be looking past a used Stellantis EV though.

If you are easily led and feel social pressures to have a big German SUV or saloon, then I pity you.And India's lead? In what exactly? They, like China, are grossly overpopulated and still continue to open new coal-use power stations. India is not a good example of anything I'm afraid.I've always had a 'little' bike or 125 scooter alongside a big fun bike for high days and holidays. If it's a dry day and I need to go anywhere, the scooter (Honda PCX) gets used. As said already, it's ridiculously frugal, but if it's sub-zero or raining/greasy on the roads then I'll drive. I've even been considering a little Super Soco electric scooter recently, simply to zip around town. 40mls range, 40mph, 75kg with the battery. It's not going to break any records but it gets great reviews and performance is adequate for town traffic. Ultimately however, the mining of the battery's lithium, shipping that across the world, extra plastic in manufacturing and so on, means that the net effect on the climate is bad in the short term. One would need to own an EV for a great number of years before truly claiming to 'help the environment'."

 On a little Fiat in Windsor earlier today, sorry no photo but plate was F147 SOOClearly ""NOT"" understood the threads title.....I understand it perfectly...it is a registration number that matches the car perfectly without having to do a thing to it.Spotted the same plate on Thursday in Frimley.  Looked like a 500E that it's attached to.Overall it's not a single single or anything, but it does (sort of) resemble FIAT 500.  My main surprise, given how common it is round here, was there was no coloured cap on the 7 to get a makeshift T and no rounding on the S to look more like a 5 - but based on the age of the occupant i'm thinking they probably don't have that mindset tbh"

I noticed this and was thinking they looked great value. Interesting at last I have found someone that thinks the same.Local Audi dealer said they don't really want them back off PCP, as users are wary about S/H pure electric stuff, and the market reflects this. He was also trying to stick me into a new one, which I don't want.Same doesn't seem to apply to Taycans, but I like the look of the Audi. Used pure EV market must still be very immature.  Watch this space I guess."

But they have to jump into his wife's mini to go to their house in the lakes which he hadn't considered when he ordered it. Got sick of driving with no heating or electrics on!My shed diesel will easily do 700 miles to a tank on the motorway, when it has a range remaining of 150 miles this is when I fill up!  I am not sure I could drive a car where the total range is equal to the point where I decide to refuel my current car.One of my neighbours had a Smart ForFour EV for two years and have recently replaced it with a Toyota Yaris Hybrid.  They got sick of the terrible range, hassle with public charging and wearing coats and blankets in the winter due to the range reducing when putting the heater on.I think EVs only work if you also have an ICE car for longer journeys.   You can then charge the EV at home and use it for local journeys such as taking the children to school.To be honest I don't think EVs work as an only car and seem to be more of a virtue signalling exercise.  You only have to look at the second hand values of EVs to see what second hand buyers think of them."

 Well, that p***ed on my chips.  I've regularly said that changes are never made retrospectively, they usually aren't. When the huge jump in VED for vehicles over 225g/km emissions was announced on budget day 2006, it only applied FROM that day, 26/03/06. But here, cars registered between April 2017 and 2025 that are currently £0 due to being zero emission will become 'standard' rate, currently £165 p.a. From 2001 to 2017, they become £20 p.a. which seems miniscule in the scheme of things, not just the amount but because there are very few pre 2017 zero-emission cars, relatively. All those electric vehicles over £40k list will be paying a LOT of VED for 5 years.... they can afford it. Edited to add: Us motorcyclists get a raw deal, again. I have to pay £101 for a >600cc bike already, and if I go electric, it will be £22 per year from 2025! So, a 125cc stinky one will be the same??  Commercial electrics get a right clobbering, up to £290 p.a.Edited by sixor8 on Thursday 17th November 13:40
But it says cars in Band A which pay £0 will move into Band B and pay £20 - This will effect all of the <99g/km diesels as well as the electric zero emitters so probably a decent amount of vehicles."

 That's the crazy thing - why isn't this angle pushed? The long running thread on PH about petrol price madness and when will it end? - The title itself suggests a significant number of people think the price of fossil fuels will come down... when will the penny drop that it is only going one way and that as a nation we need to get the majority away from it to avoid people being unable to afford to move? The fact we're so well positioned in the UK to take advantage of renewable energy and gain wealth just adds to the bizarreness of it all Not many would have grasped the concept too readily until the last couple of years when they've experienced first hand the financial instability from excessive exposure to the USD and the oil market but the real reason is that it's been easier while money was worthless and slipping around to pitch the fluffy polar bear stuff and have people buy in. Interestingly, post Uxbridge there appears to be an interesting swing away from that failing pitch and an acceptance of the reality that people would club a thousand baby seals for some nectar points. 2050 is a burden but in contrast to our economic peers who failed/chose not to de-industrialise back in the 20th century and face that immense cost and upheaval now, along with our far, far easier path to renewables (note our perfect geographical position, perfect geology we really should have been pitching economic freedom from the USD and Oil to the poorer people in the U.K. rather than patronising, scaring and ignoring them. The latter part the Conservatives appear to have finally listened to and are switching to using in a vain attempt to not get a deserved kicking at the upcoming GE. On this thread alone you can see the instant pushback against 'stop burning stuff' because of its preachy, patronising sales pitch and its wilful ignoring of those less fortunate than themselves.  They could carry the exact same message but sell it as dollar and oil economic freedom and the financial stability that comes from that and get support from the very people who rightfully push back against the patronising twaddle of religious loons and grifters.

 In time non dealer EV specialists capable of battery swaps etc will increase in number, the subsequent competition will start to pull prices down. It could take quite some time though as there is already a significant skills shortfall as not enough people working on cars are trained to deal with the high voltage systems.In the mean time, if battery swaps are too expensive to be justified by the value of the EV in question, all that will happen is that EV will lose value far more rapidly as it approaches the ten year/100k mile mark. The market will make a risk/value judgement which will determine the used value of the cars. If a battery swap was in the future far cheaper, such cars would maintain a greater value for longer.As it stands even body shops have been slow to get staff trained to deal with high voltage EV systems so it's not surprising that we don't yet have several competing battery swap shops in each town.One things for sure, if hundreds of thousands of EV are being scrapped each year when they could, with an affordable battery swap be worth £10k, that massive amount of potential value will attract businesses to look at how they can both realise that value and profit from doing so. Manufacturers could also help by signing up national auto repair centre chains as approved partners, with training etc. But really no one is going to do anything much in that direction until there are hundreds of thousands of EV's appearing each year that are old enough to provide regular custom for such services. It's all just a bit new at the moment.Indeed. We know this is very likely to be the case at some point in the future but the precise point being made is that people are asking for numbers but getting words.  Case in point being that your post, which I grew with pretty much entirely fails to answer the question being asked. It does not contain a single iota of relevant data.  That's the point being made.  As EVs come off their consumer debt cycles they start to be acquired by people who have a different way at looking at value and money and further down the line at the level PH refers to as sheds you have millions and millions of car owners that we absolutely know cannot afford to replace a battery pack, cannot afford for a car to deteriorate rapidly and statistically are the most reliant on their cars and covering the higher mileages. It's all well and good saying that certain things should happen in the future but we can already see with quite robust clarity from factual financial and demographic data that there is somewhat of an issue looming.  And some people asking for clarity serves as a warning for those who hear as opposed to those who don't wish to. Read back, the point I was making was that no dependable numbers or stats exist yet, and for that reason, buyers acquiring the cars towards the (potential) end of battery life will therefore be willing to only pay a small amount - limited buyer confidence will cause the cars to depreciate faster beyond a certain age.That sounds terrible for the cars 2nd/3rd owners who might lose a chunk due to the car ageing... but once running costs are factored in for their ownership, there may well not be very much in it Vs ice depreciation plus running costs for the same period.It's also a likely a temporary problem as we will (hopefully) learn that most EV's don't require a battery swap until they're approaching the age that value would be extremely low for any car, which makes the risk of financial loss very low. We need thousands of each make and model of each EV to pass the 10 year/100k mark before we can get any worthwhile data. People may ask for it sooner... but plainly they can't be give figures which don't yet exist.No one actually needs to take a risk thoigh, ice sheds for the masses will be around for at least another 20 years, more than enough time to sort battery swapping costs etc."

 And lets be right. The percentage of ICE cars that need a full replacement engine rather than infrequent relatively cheap repair part within 20 years must be very low. And if when so, in regards to 'normal' run of the mill stuff - Astra/Focus etc.. its a very cheap job (hundreds not thousands) to replace an engine with a good used unit from a salvage. And they do go on for thousands of miles more.It's quite possible to repair/refurbish a battery as well, but we're only talking about battery replacement, so we should only talk about full engine replacement."

So while we can say that at some point in the future that data will naturally appear and allow for correct pricing what we can also see is that it is having a detrimental impact on new sales right now because second buyers are discounting excessively to naturally compensate for unknown risks which blows up accurate PCP/leasing calcs on new sales.

It's not a certainty they will ever need to replace the battery, but if they do they have already effectively had a saving to go towards it. The car will also save them at least £1000 a year Vs ICE.Overall, despite the big bill being unwelcome, it doesn't really do very much to change the value proposition.

And here is its battery, such a scary beast, in all its glory.30 million cars travelling 240 billion miles averaging 7 miles/kWh would bring the total grid demand to just 35 TWh, a little over 10% increase in today's overall UK demand.Now think of the colossal savings that brings to the amount of charging and grid infrastructure required. The future is ALL about energy efficiency.The world's best hydrogen fuel cell car weighs more than the car above, has the same amount of interior space, yet it can only achieve just over 1 mile per kWh.Try the same thing with the Mirai rather than the Merc and now you need to find 200+ TWh of electricity.Simply ridiculous idea.This. I've mentioned it before in other EV discussion threads, the efficiency of EVs barely gets mentioned. As said above, if 7m/kWh were the norm, batteries could be much smaller and lighter.I'm old enough to remember the average fuel consumption of a typical 1.6 Cortina being about 25 mpg.We wouldn't accept that in a Focus, or whatever the equivalent is today, yet people seem oblivious to their EVs only managing 2 - 3 m/kWh."

This is why old Jag's drop in value like a stone, because all sorts of mechanical issues are likely and any number of them could immediately exceed the value of the car.In general the same can be said for both EV and ICE cars, but in the case of EV, the potential cost to replace a battery is currently particularly nerve wracking as the simply isn't data to suggest how likely it is that it will need replacing at a given age/mileage, there is also no established third party network to do the job at an affordable price.As for the future of EV's, and to an extent all modern cars no longer catering towards banger drivers... I agree. I think the powers that be are very happy not to cater to that slice of the market."

Shed drivers who do typical (i.e. low) mileage will be able to make use of a car with a battery which is pretty much buggered.An EV still has all the parts which are broken or dodgy on my shed.Seats which get uncomfortable on a long run, dodgy body electrics, worn suspension etc.There's also a lot of electronics in an EV which people ignore, because it typically outlives a battery.High power conversion circuitry like a traction inverter doesn't stay 100% relaible forever.The problem is batteries tend to accelerate their decline as time goes on.Whereas a £5k IC car becomes a £2k IC car in maybe 4 years, a £5k EV may become worthless in 2 years.Likewise I've been looking for a fresh shed, I've seen a couple of early Euro 6 cars which are basically unsellable because they've failed emissions.I'm starting to wonder if the reason I can't find many of the right cars for sale might be a lot of them have been scrapped already?"

When you look at how many finely machined components there are to go wrong in a typical engine and (frequently automatic) gearbox, it's undeniably more complex. I'm surprised that batteries suddenly go downhill, because all the real world degradation curves I've seen show faster degradation at first which then stabilises. I've seen some theoretical curves which show initial degradation followed by stabilisation and then a faster (but still linear) decline close to end of life, but I haven't seen any of those for real world data. Maybe we don't have enough high mileage cars to see it yet."

 The problem is batteries tend to accelerate their decline as time goes on.Hmmm.Some evidence suggests this:If you shorten that timeline then quite a lot of evidence points to this: I'm going to suggest that the normal 15 year lifespan for UK cars sits well within the plateau zone.Admittedly, the 'normal' 15 year life is probably based around the average time before a repair bill makes it uneconomical to keep an ICE going.A combination of some or all of tyres, discs, pads, clutch, gearbox, etc will do that.Most of that is now essentially replaced by battery only, so the repairability economics will play out somewhat different I guess."

 racecar = not coolAlso, you turn up at a cars n’coffee in literally the world’s most expensive car, I reckon you’re definitely trying a wee bit too hard. Turns up in a ratty 4x4 Panda and park it next to the ubiquitous GT4s and Mclarens, and you’re a legend. Great shout that one. I agree with you, seeing something like a survivor Renault 5, or a 205, is cooler. But I just think I like survivor cars.Having a supercar just means your a car nerd. Or far worst, just showy off rich, and have no idea about the car you have. I'm a car nerd, and I appreciate it. But I've never been cool.For example, I remember seeing a Bugatti type 57sc atlantic a few years ago. It was an amazing car, but I knew what it was. But I do wonder if the general public would just think he was a rich pri*k, or just a really old car. Sometimes its hard to see things how non-petrolheads see things.I was chatting to some of the younger ones at work about cars a few weeks ago.  These are young graphic designers, sales, marketing people in their early to mid 20's. (I work in a completely different side of the company, on the manufacturing / engineering side of things). They all seemed to like Tesla's, were as I don't really like them that much. But they would be the ""in"" crowd.(I think of electric car drivers as a bit like the old south park about hybrids and smug).

The 500E, RS2 and Lotus Carlton are certainly ""Petrolhead"" cool if you know what they are but to many, they're just an old Merc/Audi/Vauxhall and if you have to explain to someone why they're special then you've already lost. Quattroporte and AM Rapide possibly get the closest but then arguably there are cooler coupe/convertible stablemates. Saloons and estates also rarely achieve the values of their more desirable coupe/convertible counterparts.2) Hot hatches aren't cool. I'm a big fan and again the 147 GTA is ""Petrolhead"" cool but again you would probably have to explain to many why it's special and there are cooler Alfas. The one possible exception is the mk1 Golf GTi and latterly the Up! GTi possibly. The mk1 Golf GTi was a big deal for VW, everyone knows what it is and it mixed sports car performance with family car affordability and practicality when those attributes were largely mutually exclusive, that's pretty cool.3) The driver determines whether a car is cool or not. Can't a car be cool in its own right, otherwise it only takes one ""uncool"" driver to make it uncool? I would say a Ferrari 250 GT California is a very cool car but Chris Evans owns one, so does that make it uncool? I agree though that mass adoption of a car by uncool people can make a cool car uncool. Think mk1 Audi TT or mk1 Range Rover Sport.4) A cool driver can make any car cool. I think that I'm possibly a generation too young to comprehend why Steve McQueen is the King of Cool. I have watched Bullitt and Le Mans but I still don't quite get it. Could he really make a Ssangyong Rodius or a Chrysler Crossfire cool though?5) Good point on cool being spec sensitive, especially with newer vehicles. An old TD5 Defender with a bit of well-used patina is quite cool but if it has been lifted and pimped out ""Urban"" spec then less so. Likewise a tastefully specced Range Rover is quite a cool car but easy to ruin if specced in white with 22"" black wheels, dark glass all round and red leather.6) Convertibles can't be cool??? I don't really get this. I would say the coolest car ever probably is a coupe or convertible and certainly most pre-war stuff were convertibles and in many cases, the convertible version is the more desirable variant of many vehicles.  Blower Bentley, SL Pagoda, 280 SE Convertible, Alfa Spider Duetto, original Fiat 124 Spider, AC Cobra, DS Decapotable, 356 Speedster, Carrera GT, even an OG Mustang Convertible are all cool cars in my book.In my view, the non-negotiable cool cars are still the Miura, S1 E-Type FHC, SL Pagoda and original AM Vantage. The classic (unmodified) Defender, Mini Cooper and Type 2 bus are also iconic and cool, even if they are flawed in many respects.Those cars are all quite identifiable but I also can get on board with the eye-catching but unadorned cars suggested where people would find them striking but not necessarily know what they are. The Fiat Dino Coupe is a good example of this, the only downside being the Fiat badge for some.My own experience with the Type 2 was with a 1978 bay window that I rented for a long weekend travelling around the West Country. Certainly not fast but it kept up with the traffic flow when you wound it up and I even managed to maintain 70mph on the motorway on the way back for a period of time. It was surprisingly enjoyable to drive, handling and riding quite well and easy to maintain momentum through the bends with excellent visibility. The only downside being if you hit a steep hill, it really struggled. If I were to get one a sympathetic Subaru/Porsche Flat 4/Flat 6 or EV conversion would be a consideration to make it more useable but other than that, I loved it and the overall experience maintained it as a cool car in my eyes."

I'm not into EVs as such (another topic entirely) but the only one that's piqued my interest was the Honda E. I liked it being designed as a city car, range wasn't so relevant, it had some character and looked fun to drive. I'm hoping that this R5 re-imagining will be similar. Also having owned an R5, I hope they have kept the looks relatable and not just stuck a badge on from an old brand that looks nothing like. I mean credit to the Mini and especially the Fiat 500 for looking like modern versions of their old models."

 All this stereotyping stuff is such bullst. You can apply a bad stereotype to any car you like if want to.Ferrari: Chav lottery winners and footballersBentley: Orange people and footballers Lambo: You like to drive around Knightsbridge revving the tits off it.Aston Martin: man child 007 wanna bee.Rolls Royce: Gangsta rapper.Range Rover: Drug dealer or rapper.All of these are un true for 99% of owners and most people don't think that way about brands. You can twist anything to have a bad image if you want. On the flip side you could say nice things about all of the above as well.

I have driven many BMW's over the years, petrol, diesel, M Cars, X5...2 Series Active Tourer (Let's not dwell on that one) and every time got out of them wondering what all the fuss is about. There was one exception though the E46 (had to look that up) M3 CSL. They are a good car, but so are many others on the road. Do BMW make the best handling saloon on the road today? Do they have the best build quality? Best reliability? I don't think today you can say yes to any of those questions. Back in the 80's (yes I'm getting on) they were a class above but they were priced that way. Order a 3 series in the mid 80s and you had to pay extra for a radio. Not today.So I cannot see why there is such love for them."

What you have linked to is just the socket component of what would become a charger.The 3 pin cable you already use has the same electronics in the 'brick' mid cable.You need a 7kw home charger installing.

 They are a supply - a big relay and a bit of electronics inside to tell the car when to take power and how much. Some have telemetry inside and some have intelligent ways to handle Earth/neutral faults. IMO, they are ridiculously overpriced for what they do.We’re currently charging two ev’s off a single 13A supply and it’s a bit fiddly but no problem for our daily mileage (about 40 miles per day)It's a contactor, not a relay.And the 13a on cable chargers you use are similarly priced to the 7kw charging points if you ignore installation costs. They 'do' the same as the higher capacity wall chargers in terms of complexity and power management and cost about the same as result.I'm guessing you never considered the cost as the 13a on cable chargers came with the cars..?"

 Well I am confused as after watching that YouTube video above it implies that these wall chargers aren’t actually chargers but just a supply. The car has the charger onboard?I’m confused.com so will just stick with the 3 pin for nowIn fairness... before I found myself considering an EV, I had assumed they just needed a basic power cord, the fatter the cable and beefier the supply the better - and the car can take what it needs. I hadn't understood they need to 'talk' to the supply point to instigate any charging at all, or that they had on board chargers with their own limitations.But as others have said, for almost all drivers daily needs, the three pin is easily sufficient. If you can install a 7kw I would advise you do as it is quicker if you need it, and also is an increasingly attractive addition to a house as and when you sell."

 The low price of some cars in China suggests they could be poised to start seriously undercutting european carmakers, but no sign of that here.The entire long term plan since China set the it securing control of mineral rights, funding hundreds of start-up car companies, bringing European and US manufacturers in to train a work force or be locked out of the market has been to become the largest car exporter on the planet and to dominate global car sales.  Cars are just white goods like TVs and fridges to be mass produced by cheap labour and exported. Simultaneously, markets like the US and EU have worked tirelessly to try and keep the products away from their markets via legislative hurdles, taxes and anything they can to slow the inevitable but in reality a market like the EU entered into a competition they could never, ever win and despite the best efforts of governments more and more European manufacturers have had to move the manufacture of their lowest price models to China or are in the process of doing so.   A market like Germany can never compete against a true giant such as China.   We all learned this 80 years ago when Germany was the largest manufacturer on the planet but within 3 years North America was out supplying goods and on three global fronts.   The industrial might of nations such as the US or China are staggering and no European entity or combination of entities can stand in their way.  What's interesting about Britain is that we are now outside of the EU and we don't really make cars, we import them and we really don't care if they're Chinese. All cheap cars are going to be Chinese in twenty years irrespective of whether they have a German or French badge on them.   But we're the weak link today as far as Europe is concerned as we are a vital car market but we aren't tied to any nation for cars and can import them from wherever we like. If British people start to struggle to pay the high monthlies on German cars they would traditionally have switched to French or Japanese. In the past even Russian.  This decade they may well open the doors to Chinese cars. Do I think this Funky Cat is that moment? I don't because it's far too expensive.  China make cheap goods and no one objects to that but no sane person is going to rush to pay European badge pricing for something they know deep in their hearts should really cost half as much. This car smacks of a belief that Brits are total mugs when we know that they're only total mugs when they've got lots of cheap credit. When that goes away they're total tightwads who aren't going to pay silk prices for schmutter goods."

I agree.ISTM China is choosing not to pursue bulk car sales in the the UK at this point.They can sell cheap and medium price cars at home in big numbers.They are selling enough MGs here, and they are gaining experience of the market and refining their products.The UK market is not the Big Prize that the US motorcycle market was in the 60s/70s.Looking forwards, the big markets are Asia, The Americas, then Europe, but Europe may be not a priority.People (well old gits anyway) talk about when Japanese motorcycles went form being a cheap commuter option to being a winning product.Suddenly British bikes looked a bit poor and retreated to being a niche product. Some people think the Chinese will do that with cars, they will suddenly be selling 3/4 of the units, at prices which are very profitable to them, but where the Germans cannot compete. The EU has protectionist tendencies and may keep its 'New Iron Curtain' market to itself.I think one could put forwards a coherent argument that nearly all new cars should cost about half their current RRPs."

 I read this morning that the Ora Funky Cat, from Great Wall Motors, goes on sale today.It's £32,000, has a 193 mile range, and appears to have three Lookers outlets in the West Midlands as it's dealer network.It comes in 4 primary school crayon colours, and looks like a very odd mash-up of a K12 Micra and a Leaf.I'm genuinely thinking, and this is rare I think, for a car launch, that there is no-one for whom this car would make any sense whatsoever.Would anyone buy it? also Wessex Cribbs Causeway ( the Nissan dealer)Maybe the most concerning aspect of all of this is that the Chinese State having monitored the people of Britain, harvesting their personal data, tracking their every move have calculated that the biggest idiots in the U.K. are to be found in the West Midlands and Bristol.  This will surely irritate the good people of The North if someone were to read the article to them?Or is it just related to the impending ULEZ zones?"

I'm not sure that you are correct on that one - IIRC ""The Empire"" out produced Germany pretty much for the whole war...During yes, I don't think the 'Empire' began that scaling up until the late 1930s though?The problem that Germany has is that it sees itself as an industrial nation a chemicals and manufacturing power house. To get a message across a river it will build a bridge when others would just send the message by radio. The solution to every problem is to build a factory.  Now the Empire is long gone so we need to look at the US and China. Two nations that can dwarf anything modern Germany can ever hope to do in the industrial world but also the EU has committed to a more aggressive 2050 policy that will make German manufacturing even less competitive.  I always find this table of US output growth staggering and a reminder of the sort of insurmountable wall a European nation faces in this field:Table 2: Indices of American Manufacturing Output (1939 = 100)                1940 1941 1942 1943 1944Aircraft         245 630 1706 2842 2805Munitions 140 423 2167 3803 2033Shipbuilding 159 375 1091 1815 1710Aluminum 126 189 318 561 474Rubber         109 144 152 202 206Steel         131 171 190 202 197What I find interesting about the Funky Cat is that it's clearly an extremely cheap car and I wonder if China are using this car to test the waters to see if U.K. residents impacted by local ULEZ schemes will trade to EV at any cost?"

That aside if is pretty much impossible to not buy some electrical goods with no Chinese componentry/input...Tesla needing to set up in China in the way that it has and then being able to import into Europe and be processed competitive to their own product manufactured in Europe is a really interesting example of the manufacturing economies of scale that we in Europe can't even begin to compete with. Luckily for the U.K. we pretty much quite that game in the last century so are far less exposed and if anything can take advantage. More and more low level European manufacturing is being moved to China and the process of reimporting it appears underway. VW will be interesting to watch over the coming years as their MEB platform is likely to see the greatest production numbers in China due to the cost savings and the entry level VW EVs will start to be imported from China."
