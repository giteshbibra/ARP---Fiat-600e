 I think full EV is the only and last chance for Jaguar.  And it's a market where there is zero point as of yet in building a product for folk without money, without income, without driveways.   And then there is zero point in going after the standard German stuff on driveways. I suspect for a modest volume producer in an expensive country the only sane option is to target the market that's buying Range Rovers, Taycans, which is clearly large enough. When one considers the modern history of Jaguar as large cars, very smooth to drive and with large engines capable of delivering large levels of relaxing torque then shrinking those large engines down to 3 pot turbo screamers to meet emission and tax criteria was a nonstarter. Only pure EV delivers on brand values and expectations and as they've not been successful in selling off Jaguar this is their only sane step forward. They're still going to be hobbled by LR being the SUV arm but a big GT and some crossovers of varying size should be enough?  Especially as all the Tuareg based SUVs seem to be much closer to being crossovers now than twenty years ago when they had to try and pretend to look like 4x4s. I do hope Jag succeed as there's a great heritage there and they've spent the last 20 years either kicking themselves in the balls or being kicked in the balls by others.   It's certainly very bold deciding to build in the U.K.Agree completely. With respect to the highlighted, we have one of each of a FFRR and Taycan as daily drivers.  The Taycan will soon go, when another FFRR will arrive.  Much as I’d sometimes prefer the driving dynamics of a large saloon, the market seems to have moved on from them. Range Rovers of various sizes really are the default choice for quite a few people, which presents a further problem for JLR: the Jaguar brand isn’t strong enough to go after the very top end (Bentley etc), so Jaguar’s strategy in the ~£100k+ sector relies on it cannibalising sales from its sibling (and that sibling isn’t going to not offer EVs)."

Quite.I have a FFRR. But if it was the mid 90’s I would have had an XJ all day long.The biggest problem is that now the Range Rover goes round corners, does reasonable MPG & cruises comfortably at mororway speeds it does everything the old Range Rovers did, plus everything the XJ did as well.This ad could be for a FFRR:"

The remaining market is the S-Class, because tradition.So what could Jaguar do? No good merely copying the Taycan, because if people want one, they'll buy the Porsche. Tradition...Jaguar tried copying BMW and the same rule applied.It's really hard to imagine quite what it would take, not to produce another 'me-too' product with no real USP.My fear is that Jaguar is now damaged goods (like Alfa) and will no longer be taken seriously in the real market outside of us aficionados, however well they make it."

When that was pulled the XJ evaporated. I wonder if the GT isn't just the Land Rover estate project repackaged in a more appropriate shape and target market for Jaguar's brand?"

He gave a closed insight into JLR future, specifically Jag; 'Presidential' was the description Jaguar were targeting.Put that in a true 4-door GT with better space, comfort, appointment and refinement (a la mini-Bentley approach) compared to the sportier Taycan and Audi, and they could find a useful niche....and a niche that would be arguably perfectly suited to the EV powertrain.FWIW, The second project the guy was working on was the Land Rover branding....the Land Rover name will be dropped from all models by 2025. Already, the badging is smaller and less distinctive with darker colours being used. The brands will be Range Rover, Discovery, Evoque, Defender etc."

I have a friend that has a Tesla M3 & a Fiat 500E - the drivetrains are notably different.Even closer, drive a Tesla, then drive a Taycan and I'd say there was still a notable difference?The only thing that isn't as dramatically and noticeably different is the engine note."

This is certainly one thing we will lose. Currently the engine in any given car makes up a large part of that car's character, as a petrolhead you care what's under the bonnet. Eventually though, we will care as much about the motor powering our car as we do about the one in our washing machine."

Main warranty on the '21 VAG products will be up in a year and they don't have the best reputation for reliability particularly infotainment. BMW warranty also 3 years although the seem a bit better recently. Stellatis the same but reputation for getting no where near claimed range, particularly in winter, is less great.At higher mileage (more than 12m old or more than 10k miles) almost EVERY vehicle I looked at had missed or at least very late services which potentially could have issues with the drive train and other warranties. Probably not but at 15k or so do a new battery not being 100% sure of warranty was a concern for us.Ioniq much cheaper than the SUVs. Ioniq and Niro on same chassis so not a more modem vehicle at all... And you have to like SUVs and their compromises.Leaf Chademo connector is outdated an could potentially be an issue some point soon. Not very efficient, inferior warranty, much older tech than ioniq, reliability not great.Zoe was just too small. 22kw ac charging a plus and warranty is 5 years on these if early but 3  again more recently. Reliability not as good.With modern cars it isn't just the battery and drive system that has the potential for big bills, another 4.5y main warranty was a big plus for us.

Headroom in the back is very poor, and the lack of height adjustability in the seat is not good. Seats have very little lateral support and the rear seats are like a church pew. Neither is there a drivers armrest, a £150 extra..Typical Renault quirks as well like complicated steering wheel controls just to to toggle audio volume.But overall I thought the “new” Zoe was not a bad little car, it drove well and visibility was not bad. As a cheap EV it’s quite good. I was getting around 195 miles on a charge which I thought wasn’t too bad. I was impressed with the interior quality. All the knobs and switches felt high quality as did the general fit and finish, like the leatherette on the dash and the interesting headlining. Much better than Clios of old.I had the “Iconic” trim car and used it as a daily for 8 weeks.But maybe you’re right the Ioniq is probably much better as a “car” for the money if you can live with the reduced rangeThere’s no denying how good VFM a used Ioniq is.I’m still not sure I would be looking past a used Stellantis EV though. What’s the real range on a Corsa-e then?"

Wow, you're in full-on drama queen mode today! Did you even read the article?! Safety standards are increased continually. Apart from the air bag in the seats this car isn't any less safe than it was when launched.

If customers continue to demand safer and safer cars, the tests are going to continue getting stricter and stricter. Although I'm sure it is a tremendous money making scheme, it does have a lot of government connections and backing and was started by the UK Department of Transport, from wiki:The European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) is a European voluntary car safety performance assessment programme (i.e. a New Car Assessment Program) based in Leuven (Belgium) formed in 1996, with the first results released in February 1997.[1] It was originally started by the Transport Research Laboratory for the UK Department for Transport, but later backed by several European governments, as well as by the European Union.[2] Their slogan is ""For Safer Cars"".Certainly their report and score on the Zoe is daft and I would imagine Renault will be exploring some legal options against NCAP.

When you'd locked it and started walking away you could still hear it bonging about stuff to itself! Modern cars are becoming the equivalent of paying tens of thousands of pounds to have a digital mother in law, crippled with Dunning-Kruger, endlessly nagging, whittering on about rubbish, panicking over nothing and generally criticising everything.  It's just another unfortunate area where the normal, intelligent majority are having their life invaded by an incessant need to nanny the idiots. Having cars soil themselves due to a hedge, confusing a bollard with a child or fannying about with the steering wheel when you're crossing a road marking is remarkably tiresome and distracting. Finding a well build, good car that isn't a passive aggressive, invasive Japanese toilet is becoming a Holy Grail."

I also think that the pedestrian/vulnerable road user aspects should be a dedicated score, as the importance of this varies wildly depending upon how an individual uses their car. Much more valuable to somebody who does most of their driving in urban areas than to someone who covers thousands of motorway miles, where pedestrians and cyclists and so on are not encountered.Trying to amalgamate all this into a single score isn't terribly helpful, and leads to this ""OMG THIS CAR IS SO UNSAFE"" narrative which in most cases is disingenuous - a previously 5 star car is not suddenly a death trap just because it's tech has been superseded."

The Zoe got:43% for ""adult occupancy""52% for ""child occupancy"" 41% for ""vulnerable road user"" 14% for ""safety assist"" Each of those things will have different importance for different people which is presumably why they public them as individual scores. To put that in perspective by comparing it to another small BEV, the Fiat 500e just got 76%, 80%, 67% and 67% for those categories. Edited by kambites on Thursday 9th December 11:10"

 A lot of the active safety tech isn’t mature, so I can see the logic for people avoiding that at the mo.It's why EuroNCAP test it thoroughly, if fitted. Just AEB has more than a dozen scenarios they test.Most damning for me on the Zoe was the difference the newer (cheaper) airbag setup made: https://twitter.com/CillDar/status/146865825745992...The biggest thing I'd like to see is clearer marking of what testing a rating was done against, and how long ago.

That doesn't seem right.Nope, it was a 5 star car when originally tested back in 2013 at launch, since then there have been many changes in NCAP protocols, these protocols generally change every 2 years, since 2013 to 2021 the ZOE has remained largely unchanged, yet NCAP testing protocols have changed many times, with testing becoming far stricter, hence why the ZOE is now a zero star car, it is no less safe now than it was in 2013.Edited by HTP99 on Thursday 9th December 12:03"

An unusual car for a single 21 year old but I like it!Fourth (2024)2018 Volvo V90 D4 R-DesignAfter giving up new cars due to the horrendous experience with the Mercedes and not needing 2 EV’s, tomorrow I pick up this lovely Volvo V90 D4 diesel.It looks very forlorn in those pics, it had just come on to site, in pretty poor bodywork condition. Luckily, it came up pretty nice, and I bought it on the basis of the insane amount of history it has, clearly owned by a very anal previously owner! I snapped it up within 12 hours of even being listed. Hadn’t been valeted or touched in these pics.I chose the Volvo because I fancied a change and like the look of the estates. I also do a lot of miles and have a knackered back from injuries, so this one looked good. I felt the “Inscription” looked too old man for me, but I did consider the CC. This one has a few choice goodies, having Polestar pack, Apple Carplay, On Call, Front assist, Pilot Assist, privacy glass and had the benefit of being £4k less than the others I was looking at.The V90 had much cheaper insurance than the Germans which was a winner for a 21 year old. And I get to tell my mates, “here’s my (bi)turbo”I pick it up tomorrow, here’s to many reliable miles. When insurance rates go down, expect a toy parked next to it Edited by V 02 on Monday 22 July 22:34"

Here it is sitting with its little brother.First thing to do was give the interior a good clean with Dr Leather solution and wipes as it was looking a bit oily from 60+k miles.It came out pretty well.First impressions of the car, are my word it’s relaxing. This is the R-Design which I worried might be a bit too bumpy but it isn’t, its a bit firmer than the Inscription but not at all uncomfortable, infact it’s less sickness inducing as the body control is pretty good and you don’t feel too isolated. You are incredibly comfortable in this car.The seats! They’re a work of art, my spine is thanking me already.The Polestar map on the D4 engine is just right, good mid range punch, no expense in economy, and less peaky.The only con is I wish I got the “Pro pack” as this car has no Keyless, no leather dash and door tops, and no 360 cam. But I go to sleep happy as I got a great deal and it was 4-5k less than those cars.The only plans I have for now are:Get all 4 of these fked wheels refurbished.Get those silly cheapy Kumho’s off this car and fit 4 Michelin CC’s. It already had them on but the dealer removed the front two.Get a reversing camera installed (!!)All in all I was very impressed with this Volvo, it already feels like a comfy armchair. The perfect car to go next to a toy.I have noticed myself driving like an OAP and not a dhead (like in my BMW) in this car because it’s just so relaxing!"

 In 10 years will a Audi A3 do 0-60 in 3.5 seconds, will a basic fiat 500e be doing 60 in 5 seconds etc. I wonder given acceleration is a function a 1 gear high torque will firms start to limit acceleration electronically.Still want 250 miles range and a 5 min or less charge more than I want blink of an eye accelerationThing is, power and acceleration capabilities are not really in relation to range, because they're to do with the motors. If you made an EV with 1000bhp and gave it batteries for a 250 mile range, by decreasing the motor to make it only a 200bhp car will still mean it has a 250 mile range, unlike with an ICE car."

For those lacking restraint, 2 and a bit tons of metal getting to double the speed limit in two and a bit seconds is a bit of a liability.

Yes, I’ve always assumed it’s due to the computers churning out the optimal design for wind resistance. Perhaps someone involved in car design could enlighten us.

A blanket ban also seems to be where most developed countries are heading.I can understand someone opposing the idea of their Jaguar E-type being outlawed (if that was to be case), but a lot of people on the PH forum seem to be bemoaning the existence of EVs, which seems really ignorant and defeatist to me.  Especially when you consider we now have the likes of this Battista, the Rimac Nevera, Nio EP9, Lotus Evija etc when electric cars didn't really become mainstream until the Model S started being produced in 2010.  That's a really fantastic and exciting rate of development to my mind."

The downforce acts like additional weight, so increases the friction.

 Ultimately a hot hatch is one that blends most of the affordability and practicality of a family hatch with some of the driving enjoyment of a sportscar.The hot hatch is not dead.The petrol-powered hot hatch is dying especially in Europe.Future hot hatches will be BEVs.With electric power, you no longer have such a trade-off between power and economy.You're no longer constrained to FF but can be RWD or 4WD.You can also potentially do more clever stuff with torque distribution.All of these are advantages when making a hot hatch.  There are also challenges - higher weight and lack of a naturally engaging noise.So future hot hatches will be different from those we've known historically, but that doesn't mean the genre will be extinguished.The well-received Hyundai Ioniq 5 N is a good recent example (albeit a bit oversized); the Mini E, BMW i3 and Fiat 500e are all examples, but we're still very early in the electric hot hatch story. Worth adding the MG 4 Xpower and Cupra Born VZ to a growing list, plus a few warm EV hatches from Stelantis."

 Yes.A basic Tesla will murder them.Thats before we pull out the performance.I think misinformation like this probably highlights the decline of the hot hatch market. The fastest price comparable Tesla Model 3 Long Range is £50k and 0-60 is 4.2sec. Take a bog standard Golf R that is £45k and goes 0-60 in 4.1sec. Add in the Golf R being significantly better to drive at every level and just as practical as a private buyer into cars you’d have to be mad to not take the Golf R. I think some people just aren’t that aware unfortunately how fast and competent modern hot hatches have actually become. I’d wager most Tesla Model 3s would be in serious trouble even trying to keep up with a Fiesta ST or I20N down a B road never mind the segment above or on a track. The new Tesla Model 3 Performance will be a £60k car which unfortunately for the Tesla puts it into BMW M2 or Audi RS3 category. Edited by CG2020UK on Friday 23 February 17:10"

 This always seems to come up, people seem obsessed with straight line speed, a Tesla will not deliver thrills like a Clio 172 will, the Tesla will be faster but you won't be grinning throwing it down a B road the same way that you will in a hot hatch. The 90s and early 00s had the best hot hatches, the choice has been slowly dwindling since then to the point of now, where yes the hot hatch just isn't what it was and never will be.[...]Hot hatches are dead, people seem content with an electric car that'll do 0-60 in 3 seconds, but be utterly boring to throw around.Exactly, taking off like a stabbed rat is fun the first few times but all it's really doing is making the bushes go by a bit faster. If you're just driving around town it might as well be a 1.6 diesel, whereas with an actually fun car you can always make it enjoyable by chucking it round a junction on three wheels.Nobody in their right mind drives a diesel for town use only.  It is completely unsuited and it screws up the DPF filter.  Nimble EVs will come in fact my i3s embaresses a few hot hatches albeit the suspension needs modifying.  What you may not realise is EVs have a very low CoG and polar moment unlike an ICE.  The weight location is ideal for a hot hatch.Manufactures are out to make a profit and when they produced a hot hatch version of a small family car the economics worked as a big chunk of the vehicle was the mass produced monocoque, electric harness instruments and much of the running gear.  As ICEs are no longer being developed there is no base vehicle on which to base future ICE hot hatches.We've been lumbered with SuV because sadly that's what people have wanted for quite a long time now, and well before EV, the idea largely imported from the USA much like thie grim and pointless trucks.  Currently EV development has been at the higher cost end for obvious reasons.  This is already beginning to change."

 I've previously owned an i3 and an e-up. I'd opt for the VW every day of the week. Sorry to hijack but why - I'm leaning the other way but haven't driven either. Much longer commute than the OP's daughter though. (32 miles each way)Plenty of reasons (bearing in mind that I'm comparing an early MY14 i3 with a MY20 e-up with the 2nd gen battery pack)
RELIABILITY : e-up was reliable and had zero niggles in 2 years whereas the i3 was the most unreliable car I've ever owned. It was so bad that BMW paid me compensation for how many times it had to be booked in for work. All sorts of issues, charging failures, wonky door hinges, failed motor mounts, LIM replaced twice, etc. I'm sure owners of later i3's will tell you this is better now. I'd happily own an e-up out of warranty (in fact I gave my e-up to my elderly mum and have no concerns about that) whereas there's no way I'd own an i3 out of warranty.
RANGE : e-up had more than double the range (yes, newer i3's are improved). 
EFFICIENCY : e-up was significantly more efficient therefore cheaper to run (easy to get > 6 m/kWh, see 'The Lowly Mii' thread for other owner's experiences).
REAR DOORS : e-up has normal doors not those silly ones on the i3 where rear passengers can't get out without assistance from front passengers (and be an  utter pain in confined spaces).
LOOKS : e-up is a more inconspicuous car if you value that.
DRIVING : e-up is a lot of fun to drive, maybe call this category a draw but it's better than you'd expect and doesn't suffer from the cross wind jitteriness of the i3. 
COST : e-up was £167 a month, the i3 was more than double. Just not worth the difference IMO

I noticed this and was thinking they looked great value. Interesting at last I have found someone that thinks the same.Local Audi dealer said they don't really want them back off PCP, as users are wary about S/H pure electric stuff, and the market reflects this. He was also trying to stick me into a new one, which I don't want.Same doesn't seem to apply to Taycans, but I like the look of the Audi. Used pure EV market must still be very immature.

Got sick of driving with no heating or electrics on!My shed diesel will easily do 700 miles to a tank on the motorway, when it has a range remaining of 150 miles this is when I fill up!  I am not sure I could drive a car where the total range is equal to the point where I decide to refuel my current car.One of my neighbours had a Smart ForFour EV for two years and have recently replaced it with a Toyota Yaris Hybrid.  They got sick of the terrible range, hassle with public charging and wearing coats and blankets in the winter due to the range reducing when putting the heater on.I think EVs only work if you also have an ICE car for longer journeys.   You can then charge the EV at home and use it for local journeys such as taking the children to school.To be honest I don't think EVs work as an only car and seem to be more of a virtue signalling exercise.  You only have to look at the second hand values of EVs to see what second hand buyers think of them."

 BMW i3s.   Brilliant fun, c.180hp, not hugely fast but light (for an EV).  I see mine as a modern day interpretation of my old Mk2 golf gti.   Small-ish, but great turning circle and practical stuff like that.  £18k should get you into an early 120aH BEV model (about 68 plate like mine).   We have a fleet at work and the driving experience is horrible, at least to me. They bounce a lot and take time to settle back, they’re tall and slab sided so very sensitive to cross winds, they’re hard to drive smoothly because of the regenerative braking, the tyres are like bike tyres so they really don’t drive like a normal car. The i3 is a real oddity to me, every time I drive one I can’t understand how BMW who were renowned for driving dynamics could have produced it. On the plus side the power train is very nice, but I’d rather have a Corsa E over the i3."

 Tethered - Wallbox Pulsar MaxUntethered - Easee One or SyncEVYou won't go wrong with any of them and all are easy to use. If your car has a delayed charging facility (so it charges overnight) you can just set it up on the car. If not, any charger can do this too but it is better to get the car to do it igf it can.As a Hypervolt owner, I agree with Frimley. To be fair, I've had no major issues with Hypervolt; only a few niggles, but it was overhyped and not lived up to my expectations. Maybe that's down to me, but I feel let down and disappointed with my purchase. I enjoyed the £350 OZEV grant so cost 'only' £569 including installation - I'd think long and hard before paying what they cost now."

Close to house wall, the mud on the left is actually sitting on top of the wall foundations, the brown item on the right is a 110mm drain. So, some excavation required to confirm location before knocking it in. Duct for earth cable and earth pit yet to be fitted in that photo.But much better than relying on a multipole relay/contactor to disconnect ALL the connections to an external EVSE.I am lead to believe that all new builds are getting earth rods - at least around here, so hopefully that is less of a problem as time goes on."

I will check over the weekend as it doesn't sound like it will achieve the required outcome to me.Installation: I agree. Not wishing to upset those who are installers on here... It looks like most of the work is really 'building' type work. The electrical side is fairly simple if a duct or cable is in place. However, for an ordinary homeowner without that capability, they need someone - an installer - that can do the whole job for them. Most of the cost must be in doing the prep. Once you have the cable routes and access in, the remainder isn't too hard.But, the installer has to do this, and cost for it. People don't see the value in all of that."

 I don't think obsolescence is that much of an issue.  Every year there will be cars with better energy density and quicker charge times but not sure that's particularly relevant to existing vehicles which will still be doing what they were bought to do. The depreciation aspect is only an issue for people who trade regularly, especially as most used EVs are post 2020 so still plenty of in play depreciation over the next couple of years. But none of that is relevant if holding for a longer period. For people who use the same car for as long as ten years they can represent huge bargains. I would say that once someone has a usage that clearly and easily fits then the next step is to consider how much a comparable ICE will cost to operate per month versus the EV over a good period of time such as 8-10 years whereby the depreciation will be relatively moot but the potential gains over fuel costs and maintenance could be manifestly superior. All cars depreciate to scrap so if held to pretty much that point then the EV probably smashes it but also, if in doubt just stick with the current car and run the maths in a couple of years. I don't think there's any kind of rush unless where someone uses their ICE has a local authority seeking to heavily tax those users. This."

 This stuff attracts quite the crowd of people who would benefit from some healthy outlets in their lives!It's tough though.  When they were younger they had the world at their feet and were free.  Friday nights were 'go and punch someone for wearing different clothes' as a warm up to a Saturday of 'sausagefest pub followed by punching someone from another town who'd bussed in for the afternoon in their special uniform'.  All week the little lady, who still knew her place was at home cooking and cleaning.  And there were the seasonal National Front rallies that offered a nice day out and some healthy exercise.  Then comes the horror of retirement and a world gone mad.  You're not supposed to hate someone for just looking different.  You keep being told that women have the same rights as you. As do foreigners.  You see those people driving Range Rovers which were once only for people you'd prostrate yourself before because they were so superior, meanwhile, parked two doors down is one's ten year old Meriva because some jumped up fancy pants has parked in your private parking space in the public Highway opposite your front room.  Your children have become everything you loathe with their fancy German cars, silly clothes that don't fit, equality in their partnerships and having friends who aren't facsimiles of themselves and that's before even getting to their libtard brainwashing. Too old to step into the street to punch someone and unable to attend a free speech sausage fest because the local flat roofed pubs have become vegan cup cake shops, they resort to the safety of road rage and posting on the internet how bad EVs and SUVs are.  Horses and bicycles are also used by the filth you're not allowed to directly hate so they can have some along with 'yummy mummies at the school gates' in cars you don't think women should be allowed to use. The only true constant in life, the only friend who has stuck with them through it all and been their guiding light since first becoming an adult, keeping them safe from cancerous foods and warning them about all the people who are bad, sparing them from the oppressive yoke of logic, education and balance are the tabloids. The speakers of truth, the one constant that always tells them what to believe and what to say, while giving them the strength to stand as the thin red line like so many stout English yeomen have before them but this time the foe isn't the French or uppity natives armed with over ripe mangos but truth, reason and intelligence.  As a soldier of ignorance and intolerance they hold the line all across the U.K. until their fat Sharon of 40 years shouts at them that tea is on the table or that it's time to go to bed, put the bins out or drive the to The Range for a new shiny thing.

I think one of the new BYD cars, a Model 3 knock off can't even do EV charger route planning in the EU.The gap in technology is diminishing rapidly. The newest Taycan is a lot more efficient than the outgoing, but you could still road-trip easily in the old one. If Toyota, in their fantasy dream-land scenario made a cheap solid state battery and put out a new car at 35k with 400 mile range with twice avg efficiency, it still wouldn't necessarily be a 'must-buy'  over a lot of other used EVs in the last few years."

I think the financial point is the bigger issue for me, but you’re right as long as the car does what i need it to the advancement of range and charging speed shouldn’t matter. Personally, I think the key re used EVs is that none of us know what shape the depreciation curve for them to take but what is absolutely guaranteed is that just like all other generic cars is that they will go to zero.   So what that means is that we can run the sums really well on a plan to buy and hold but if one prefers to just hold for a short period there is a big variable in just how much of that trend to zero will be front loaded in the first couple of years.

 All fair points, i don’t baulk at buying an old ICE car even though it’s not modern tech, so shouldn’t apply the same to EVs. I think the financial point is the bigger issue for me, but you’re right as long as the car does what i need it to the advancement of range and charging speed shouldn’t matter. Personally, I think the key re used EVs is that none of us know what shape the depreciation curve for them to take but what is absolutely guaranteed is that just like all other generic cars is that they will go to zero.   So what that means is that we can run the sums really well on a plan to buy and hold but if one prefers to just hold for a short period there is a big variable in just how much of that trend to zero will be front loaded in the first couple of years.

Unlikely to be zero, unless the battery is totally knackered.House batteries are crazy money. Last time I looked, a 10kwh unit was around £7k.At that price, and if there is enough space, parking an old EV and wiring it up seems viable. Even a degraded Leaf would work I think.Demand for old car battery packs will set the ""scrap"" price of EVs."

By 'zero' I meant scrap which should be higher for EVs but as we don't really know yet and typical scrap values are £2-300, it's just fairer to set the value at zero.

As above it's a no brainer.Full disclosure, of an age that could buy a new ICE runabout and it would almost certainly see my driving days out, but frankly I don't trust central or local government not to do something to seriously make ICE life difficult for daily drivers.

 So, I got access to our portal this morning. A large employer and it is with Zenith 40% tax payer.Very underwhelmed with the cost of cars on there. I am aware of the state of the electric car market and the lack of residuals will inevitably hit the costs of the lease market. But it does seem incredibly steep. Very ordinary cars like the ID.3 and Model 3 are north of £500 a month NET.Do company portals fluctuate in price in a similar manner to personal leases? i.e if cars drop on lease loco there is a chance they will drop on a sal sac portal too?I am in no rush and I know you should buy the deal not the car, but I think I may have missed the boat on the £500/600 iX's and the various EQ's.Anyone seeing anything of interest? Not sure how your portal works but if your spec'ing the car from scratch it will cost more. I saved about £260 a month by taking a stock car when they came in. Only choice I had was the colour. happy with that to be honest. That was with Tusker.For our scheme, Tusker, the deals certainly don't seem to be as competitive as they were at the end of 2023 but I expect a large part of that is teh level of supportr from naufcaturers to shify meytal.  Year end is often a rush to clear the decks or hit targets.  At one point in December a Mercedes EQE was sub £400.For the specifc Nissan Ariya Engage mentioned above, it is currenty £397 (36 months/10k miles/metallic) with 45% tax relief on our Tusker site.  Add £34 @ 40% I think.  But an 'in stock'  Evolve trim is £437 and there are 20 of them in stock right now. It seems to me the best of, for Tusker at least, of salary sacrifce is for cars that manufafacturers are putitng money behind.

 They definitely fluctuate on ours. 18 months ago a Taycan was £650 net and now is a few kid shy of £1400. Assume it’s a mix of available deals, residuals and insurance costs (as they need to price it to cover all qualifying employees).After a test drive I wasn’t interested 18 months ago and I’m not interested now. Only decent deals are Tesla Model Y and the MG hot hatch. I wanted a Fiat 500e or electric Mini (for Mrs S rather than me) but PCP or PCH are massively cheaper. I guess the only exception would be if you were young and insurance ran into thousands per year - which was the main reason I had company cars in my 20s. The year I ordered my first one the company car tax was less than half of my best insurance quote. Good to know it isn't just ours then - Taycan isn't on it at all at the moment.I am happy to stretch the man math's calculator as ours is an all in scheme in terms of maintenance and servicing.Like you, I do think if I can't make it work for me a Volvo EX30 or the like could be good for the other half, but that is knocking on £500 a month for a car with a relatively low P11dPSRG said:

So I hope our scheme is broadly competitive.Although we too (Zenith) are showing the Ariya as being available as a stock car but that doesn't give a price it gives a number to call so the price above is for ordering.

Rich guy whining without making any effort to explain the context of his opinion.The true stat is that in the UK 99%+ of all journeys are less than 100 miles. In other words, the cheapest current EV you could buy is more than up to the job.But of course even though it's true most of us rarely travel that far by car, there are exceptions... But even then, the occasional reliance on en-route charging has to be offset against the general ease of home charging and the cost saving of an EV.What I find weird is another stat: it turns out that 99% of those that simply don't like EV's happen to be towing boats up and down the country 3x a week and therefore can't possibly entertain anything they can't constantly refuel. It's bizarre, I've spent 20 years driving on our motorways and I hardly ever see a boat being towed - yet apparently there are millions that do it endlessly and over great distances. Perhaps they take the back roads, on their 300 mile long journeys.."

 the car is a deduction from your gross. the scheme kindly does it as a paye deduction once a month. if you earn bonus etc ontop it’s calculated against your entire earnings. so you may for example be in 40% rate on basic, but bonus pushes you well into 60%. this the effective discount is based of paying 60% not 40%. tax return at end of year will sort it all out automatically. On a similar basis, your salary needs to be above the 40% tax threshold by your total gross payment for the year to get the 40% benefit. If you’re only say 6k above the threshold (and remember that’s after pension contributions etc too) but your gross payment is 12k a year, only 6k will be at 40%."

My 'fun' car is now also quite capable for long trips, so the 'sensible' car doesn't have to cross continents.  However, I'd still like to have half-decent range as the fun car may not be suitable to use in all circumstances.The EV would live on a driveway, so I'd hope home charging won't be a problem.   Driving is mixed A and B roads and Dual Carriageways / Motorways, likely less urban although it will see some.  Usage is mostly weekends going up to 40 miles each way for a walk/cycle/canoe.   It will probably see occasional  longer trips up to ~180 miles but if it could do those with a single charging stop with reasonable flexibility, that would be ok.It only really needs to seat two adults, but I want to be able to get a bicycle in the back with the rear seats down.My current petrol 'sensible' car could probably sell for approximately £15k, so if I can find an EV for that much it would be a straight swap on value, but hopefully save quite a bit on running costs and and get to enjoy the smoothness and linear response of an EV and its convenience on shorter trips - plus trimming my carbon footprint.Range, performance, handling, ride, comfort and convenience of charging are all factors although I appreciate obviously the budget means there will be compromises.I'm not absolutely going to do this right away, but I'm actively considering making the switch sometime this year.My current shortlist is:Nissan Leaf Mk2 - unfortunately the 62kWh e+ versions seem mostly above this mark, and the 40kWh seem a little short on range but worth considering. Hired one for a day and it was decent apart from charging.Renault Zoe 50kWh - good range, unsure how they shape up in other waysPeugeot e-208Vauxhall Corsa e (a less fashionable 208)MG5 - probably not, but a contender on paperHyundai Ioniq 38kWh - this is a bit interesting because it has a smaller battery but apparently gets really good efficiency even on the motorway, I've seen 170 miles at 70mph quoted.  It would also have a couple of years warranty remaining.I've mostly ruled out:BMW i3 - even the 42kWh doesn't seem to give that good rangeVW e-Golf - poor rangeKia Soul - Ioniq is better (?)Merc B-Class - far too short rangeSeat Mii - poor rangeAny thoughts on the merits of my contenders, any car I've ruled out I should reconsider, and any other options I've not thought of?"

It's pretty basic inside, but perfectly functional. The only thing I remember being a bit odd was the driving position - specifically, the steering wheel was a bit 'bus-like' i.e. tilted towards the horizontal for my liking, but hardly a deal breaker. You'd have to take the front wheel off a bike, but other than that sounds like it would be ideal. £15k would get you a higher power version. This was plenty nippy enough for daily use. I think it's a good little car for what it is. We were getting circa 200 miles on a charge without trying with mixed use."

It's our only car and I will have range issues with it in the winter. I do a regular 70 mile there and back and I know I'll have to charge to get home when it gets colder.It's white goods really. I have swapped a flat 6 burbly load lugger with high running costs and a fair bit of punch, for a serene box with limited load space and very low operating costs. My bike or the wife's wheelchair fits, but the rear seats are easy to fold.I now derive pleasure from tech, the quality of the sound system, and in real terms it's quite bit quicker than the petrol wagon was. I do a low mileage, and most of my charging is done at home, utilising a clever charging point to extract as much from the solar panels as possible.A few weeks ago, I did a series of 200 miles trips, needing to charge to get home. 4 of the trips were magic and no problem. We had to wait whilst charging for 40 mins at one point, but my brother and I watched a video about the TSR2 so the time flew by. The 5th trip was a nucking fightmare, with unresponsive chargers, stupid payment systems, credit card blocking etc etc. But; I've learnt from that and it won't happen again.Plus points for me are that it fits my lifestyle to charge mostly at home so it's very cheap motoring. We live in a small village and it's great on rural roads. It can do stupid quick overtakes, and on open roads it flows down the road very well. It's a very pleasant place to be in. Great seats for medium sized people. I no longer feel I'm harming the car to fire it up for a 1/2 mile journey, no issue with cold engine!-ve points. The car corners well, but the handling is not so smooth. Despite its clever construction; because of it's relatively tall, there's a real consideration of weight transfer in direction changes. Using the throttle to adjust direction is not smooth; applying power can be a bit sudden, and lifting off needs to be done with caution as the regen will really unsettle it in mid corner. In consideration for passengers, I usually use eco-pro mode as the throttle response is softer. I'm glad I bought the I3S, it's basically a great fun box. It's major drawback is the limited range, but for us that's not much of a problem, because it fits our lifestyle."

However I do see the similarity in it being a clean-sheet small car with no preconceptions, so it's arguably a comparably bold and far-reaching small car in 2013 as the Mini was in 1959.Depreciation is a good point.  I'm initially thinking in terms of a ~2 year ownership.It looks like the median asking price of a 2020 Ioniq is £15400, while a 2018 model is £13200 (with the smaller battery).  So £2200 depreciation over two years.EVs have recently come down quite a lot in value, to me this decreases the chance that there will be further big falls in future (beyond normal depreciation).  I think a cheap EV with a half-decent range (150 miles more or less) will still be reasonably valued into the future.In terms of battery degradation I'm aware of the issues the Leaf has, at least the Mk1.  Otherwise batteries seem to be holding up well and if anything the rate of decline seems to reduce over time rather than falling off a cliff.  However this is just from a bit of quick googling.The only PHEV I'd be interested in is the Note e-Power, because that has fully electric drive.  But generally the extra maintenance of an ICE puts me off.Taycan - I've decided to invest the major part of my motoring budget in the 'fun' car, since that way it brings me most enjoyment and fun cars don't depreciate as sharply.

Safer?I guess the big part for me is this is an experiment before I need to and I quite like the idea of an electric car as a daily.  But it seems that the technology to charge is changing/advancing at the moment with many different sorts.  The Taycan has a new system which means something and is supposedly better.  But say I get a home charger for an i-Pace on a 2 year lease then buy in to the electric car premise and get something for myself will I have to change the charger?In summary:Granny charging OK if you are giving it back (lease) do what you like and what suits you over a 2 year period.If you are going to buy an electric car, run it longer and want it to retain some usefulness/efficiency over time then get a home charger installed.I think that leads me to experiment for a couple of years/year at a time (lease), try a few models see what I like and then commit to longer with the appropriate charger (buy).Thank you, it has all helped."

 However, the whole premise of ownership begins to fall apart when you try and arrange to have a 7kW charged installed at home. I live in an old farmhouse with nothing else around me, my wife and I are 'empty nesters' but we have the temerity to own a washing machine and tumble drier, a power shower and an electric Aga cooker. Apparently these modest electrical items mean that I have to have a new fuse fitted by the local power company (and can I get an answer to when this might happen? No) before they can install the charger, as the total existing load might exceed 79A and the standard fuse is 100A. So I'm faced with the prospect of taking delivery of a car that I can only charge through a 13A socket, which could take >24 hours. I'm rapidly losing enthusiasm. Am I unusual or is this a taste of what everyone will experience? I'm sure the charger installers will bend over backwards to give good customer service but the power companies will be their usual useless selves: we've been waiting a year for them to trim back some tress which are touching their powerlines in our field!Your problem isn't really with the electric car charger. Your problem is that your house electrics are old and not fit for the future, so they need upgrading. I know that it is a hassle to bring them into the 21st Century, but houses often need upgrading for new fangled things. Just think how much of a hassle it would have been to install running water, or a WC. I'm afraid that all of our utility companies are utterly useless, electricity, gas and telecoms (but I take some solace in discovering that Deutsche Telekom in Germany is every bit as bad as BT). When I built my house, everything had a 12 week lead time, and cost an arm and a leg.One further thing to consider. How good is your mobile phone coverage? Smart meters have to have access to a mobile phone signal to communicate with HQ. If you are in a dead zone, (like I was until a couple of years' ago) that might also limit installation.I hope that you persevere. Good luck."

No noticeable detriment to the battery and no worry each morning if you have enough juice. Once you have an EV, it just comes naturally. Only over the weekend with short trips to the shops we don't bother charging. It really is simple and not something you worry about."

 However, the whole premise of ownership begins to fall apart when you try and arrange to have a 7kW charged installed at home. I live in an old farmhouse with nothing else around me, my wife and I are 'empty nesters' but we have the temerity to own a washing machine and tumble drier, a power shower and an electric Aga cooker. Apparently these modest electrical items mean that I have to have a new fuse fitted by the local power company (and can I get an answer to when this might happen? No) before they can install the charger, as the total existing load might exceed 79A and the standard fuse is 100A. So I'm faced with the prospect of taking delivery of a car that I can only charge through a 13A socket, which could take >24 hours. I'm rapidly losing enthusiasm. Am I unusual or is this a taste of what everyone will experience? I'm sure the charger installers will bend over backwards to give good customer service but the power companies will be their usual useless selves: we've been waiting a year for them to trim back some tress which are touching their powerlines in our field!Your problem isn't really with the electric car charger. Your problem is that your house electrics are old and not fit for the future, so they need upgrading. I know that it is a hassle to bring them into the 21st Century, but houses often need upgrading for new fangled things. Just think how much of a hassle it would have been to install running water, or a WC. I'm afraid that all of our utility companies are utterly useless, electricity, gas and telecoms (but I take some solace in discovering that Deutsche Telekom in Germany is every bit as bad as BT). When I built my house, everything had a 12 week lead time, and cost an arm and a leg.One further thing to consider. How good is your mobile phone coverage? Smart meters have to have access to a mobile phone signal to communicate with HQ. If you are in a dead zone, (like I was until a couple of years' ago) that might also limit installation.I hope that you persevere. Good luck.Not true about ‘old electrics’. Modern houses are being fitted with 80A, often 60A fuses, because modern insulation standards should limit the amount of power needed. Little allowance for the use of EVs is being considered yet. ‘Older’ properties often have up to 100A fuses which would almost always allow an EV charger to be fitted. We have a 100A fuse but also an 8kw heat pump and the other stuff. We have an e-Niro on order but if I can’t get a 7kw charger we’ll be reconsidering. (Likewise if the EV grant is stopped, that’ll end the idea)."

 Exactly.  I can understand getting a dedicated charger from a convenience standpoint but it's hardly an absolute necessity for most.I would argue that from a practical standpoint, it is necessary to have a 7kw for an iPace. It means that whatever your state of charge, you can charge to full overnight. I do about 10k miles pa in my iPace, and I frequently need to do a big charge overnight. Plus it means I can do the vast majority of my charging overnight on E7 rates, which probably saves approx £200 per year compared to charging throughout the day on a granny charger."

 I guess the big part for me is this is an experiment before I need to and I quite like the idea of an electric car as a daily.  But it seems that the technology to charge is changing/advancing at the moment with many different sorts.  The Taycan has a new system which means something and is supposedly better.  But say I get a home charger for an i-Pace on a 2 year lease then buy in to the electric car premise and get something for myself will I have to change the charger?The advances in charging are on the rapid charging side - putting lots of electricity in as quickly as possible while on a journey. It's not something you'd have at home. Home charging is limited by supply to your house and spare capacity after your other electrical stuff, so the vast majority will be using 7kW single phase AC. It's good enough for putting 20-25 miles of range per hour into the car (depending on how efficiently your car uses it) so enough to fill most cars overnight easily.  If you have 3 phase at home and a capable charger in the car then you can get a bit faster but not worth doing just for car charging. Fit a 7kW charger now and it'll be fine for the future."

  I've heard this said in passing. Can anyone be more precise with efficiency numbers and risk?I think the issue is more whether it's sensible to be constantly drawing 13amps from one domestic socket on the house's ring main than any risk of damaging the car. Obviously it depends how your house is set up, but if it has one ring servicing both garage and house, you can only draw 26amps total from that ring; if your car is constantly drawing half of that there's a far higher chance of exceeding the total current draw limit if you, for example, try to boil the kettle while the oven is running. Also some older sockets can get rather hot at a constant 13amp draw.If your garage has its own ring off the consumer unit and your wiring is reasonably modern, I think long-term use of the granny cable is unlikely to be a problem."

 I have installed a home charger in the same scenario as you describe without having to upgrade the 100A fuse.

 This thread is music to my ears..I'm hoping to buy a used i3S in a couple of months.I did some research by looking up the webuyanycar offers on some advertised cars, and the prices are so far apart it just means that there's no trade buyers right now. So there are a few dealers with v.expensive stock. Do some dealers still have 100day limits?I have done this for years and I’ve done the same as you. In fact years ago before BCA bought WBAC I used to go to auctions and check what may be worth buying, I’d then punch the details into WBAC and see how far I should bid up to. On a number of occasions I bought a car I didn’t need because it was so cheap and then took it to WBAC as soon as the V5 had come through. I was annoyed when BCA bought WBAC as it knackered that little system.However I digress, I too have noticed a significant gap between what WBAC had valued around Christmas compared to the last couple of weeks. In cases we are talking in excess of 30k less than screen price, ok so I’m looking at 100k plus cars but…..a few months ago the gap was around 5-10k less."

7 years until you can't buy a new pure ICE car.  Hybrids will be on sale until at least 2035 so 12 years until buying a full BEV will be your only choice if buying new.  There will of course still be a huge amount of used ICE/Hybrids also available at that point.ICE and EV will use the same chips so would expect the issues to be common across all cars if they are genuinely as widespread as suggested?"

Agreed, used (EV) prices are still too high with some way to go. Model Y is relatively new so that will be little while. Hopefully people keep leasing and Tesla keep cutting prices I also think EVs are much of a muchness. When we replace the family wagon, I’m honestly not too bothered about which one of the current crop we go with. I would like a Y, but equally happy with anything from Korea or Europe. This will no doubt have an effect on residuals.  Edited by JAMSXR on Wednesday 15th February 13:16"

We can always hope that Tesla will cut prices, but if Tesla are telling us the truth about how much it's costs to make one it would appear there is no scope for anything significant. In fact with Profit,VAT,Import duty etc the current price is more than reasonable. Used car prices won't be resolved until the Electricity prices get sorted as the average used car is buying is a much different beast to a new car buyer."

 I recently sold my GT3 back to Porsche. The sales guy was very chatty and we talked for quite some time about the car market in general. He cautioned me against buying electric unless I wanted to lose my shirt in depreciation. He even went to far as to say that they (dealers) are now trying to avoid electric used car buy-ins as they can't move them.Another acquaintance who owns a WBAC type business (obviously much smaller) has stopped making offers full stop on electric cars as they can't move them either and what they did have they ended up selling at a loss to get rid.Maybe the market will stabilise in time but right now is not good as a seller but perhaps not so bad for buyers.At the moment it's like a staring contest between dealers who want to shift their EVs they're watching depreciate vs buyers who want a new Ev but are hoping for a price drop before they're forced to re-finance/move-on/replace."

I would argue that you’re likely no worse off financially with 25k to splash on a car, compared to someone who’s using a salary sacrifice/leasing scheme. Even if these people have an extra 10-15k to spend, they’re also probably thinking a used EV as current prices doesn’t quite stack up I also appreciate that EVs can/will outlast an ICE, but I would be interested to know the current first ownership tenure. Have we just encouraged people to buy and replace more often than before. I would guess that EVs have significantly increased the uptake of new car purchases, these cars are now being replaced more frequently. Seems a little counter productive, although I’m happy to capitalise on lower used prices Edited by JAMSXR on Wednesday 15th February 13:49"

 There were a lot of these strange overlaps in the confusion that was BMC/BL. The older ‘Farina cars significantly overlapped the various Maxi models and Morris Minors overlapped the 1100/1300 range.I'd say that neither of these really count. For the TR4 and Herald these are more like options and spec trim levels - IRS on the TR4A was a cost-option in the US market but those cars still had all the other (minor) cosmetic, interior and mechanical upgrades that the 'standard' TR4 had. Similarly the Herald 1200 remained as a lower cost, lower-spec alternative to the 13/60 but they were still fundamentally the same car. The Triumph 1300 started out in development as a successor to the Herald but long before production began Triumph realised they couldn't sell it at anything like the Herald's price so slotted it into the range between the Herald and the 2000 to compete against the BMC ADO16. It wasn't really the 'new generation' being sold alongside the old one. Same went for the Austin Metro, which was developed to entirely replace the Mini but late in development was pushed slightly upmarket and the mechanical improvements cascaded down to the Mini so the latter could stay in production as the bottom-price economy entry to BL's range. But it's not really right to say the 1300 or the Metro ever made it onto the showroom floor intended as replacements for their older counterparts. Same with Foss62's BMC examples - although common sense would suggest that the Maxi should have replaced the Farina-B models, and the ADO16 should have replaced the Minor, that was never the intention. So not a case of 'old sold alongside new'. The FWD cars were expansions of the range, not developments of it. I'm also not sure I'd really class the (for instance, Mercedes or BMW) habit of phasing in model variants on a new generation as quite the same thing - BMW had every intention of the E36 fully replacing the E30, but spread the costs across a few years by having the estate models run slightly out of step with the main range.I think the clear-cut examples are ones like the Range Rover P38/Range Rover Classic, where two distinct generations of the same model sold squarely alongside each other with the older version priced and pitched slightly lower than its replacement. Or the Renault Campus models, where the R5 Campus existed as a one-model bargain basement option alongside the Clio, and the second-gen Clio stayed on as the Clio Campus alongside the third-gen. See also Ford's habit in the 50s and 60s of stripping back the outgoing Anglia model and selling it alongside the new one as a Popular."

 All are 7kW and this is enough for 99% of needs, even with multiple vehicles
 You won't get faster chargers as your home doesn't have any more spare electrical capacity. Homes were never designed for such a high demand item
 Charging sockets/cables are universal and are known as 'Type 2'
 You can have chargers with a socket which means using the cable in your car to charge at home. These chargers tend to be be smaller and neater when not in use
 You can have chargers with cables, known as 'tethered' chargers. These are like a petrol pump in that you use the cable on the charger to plug in to your car. However they can look messy when not in use (if the chargers are physically larger the cable can wrap around them more neatly).
 All have software/Apps - this just allows you to schedule charging (you can may be able to do this) and monitor consumption.
 There are around 100 chargers on the market but I have not (in 7 years) come across any that should avoided but I'd stick with the larger brands as they have the best support, if needed. Although even then it can be patchy.
 Brands - Easee, Wallbox, PodPoint, EO Charging, SyncEV, Ohme, Zappi and Hypervolt are good places to start. Perhaps avoid the BP charger as it is pretty big and cheap looking.
 Home chargers have evolved about as far as they can so don't worry about future proofing, you'll be fine with whatever you choose
Hope that helps"

 After three years the current model on sale then will have superior tech, the batteries of the three year old one will be about a third of their journey into the total unknown and the cost of replacing them will still be £47m and a ride on your granny.Let's debunk this now. (Not personal to you, DA; it's just your comment encapsulated a few on this thread and in others.)ICE car engines fail, shortly out of warranty, and at four-figure costs to replace the engine. However, that is very rare. In the same way, catastrophic battery failure has been known to happen but in very small numbers and the level of risk is broadly similar to that of buying a three year old ICE and being billed for a new engine.Also, in many cases individual battery cells can be replaced rather than the whole lot. Try buying half an engine block...What's interesting is the persisting nature of this concern expressed by DA and others about better fault when we have a generation of liquid-cooled battery cars like Zoes and Tesla Model Ss that have done intergalactic mileages without complaint. Public perception remains like this despite the fact those early fears have been disproven, or at least shown to be equivalent or better than the risk of catastrophic ICE failure.The relatively large numbers of early Nissan Leafs with inferior air cooled batteries that degraded badly haven't helped with perception but it's more than that. When battery powered vehicles fail, it seems to induce a collective response that outstrips the actual probabilities involved. It's similar for vehicle fires: everyone loves a news story about battery fires but your neighbour's diesel Astra is more likely to combust than an electric car.I wonder if there were similar conversations when cars began to replace horse-drawn vehicles. Until the public become more familiar and comfortable with the tech, it's going to take a lot of gentle persuasion and PR to overcome the visceral reaction of many who hold concerns.Even when EVs reach Toyota Corolla levels of reliability, managing the perception will still really matter.Yup but it is for the very reasons you state that the consumer currently applies that part of the discount.  EVs have only been selling in any number for a few years and it will be years yet before a general understanding of the durability of that battery chemistry filters through. But then that understanding won't be relevant to the newt cell chemistry. Uncertainty equals discounted perception of value. Plus, one can also consider the actual consumer demographic of the used EV buyer. They have money because they have driveways, they're educated because they aren't terrified of the new or angry over change but at the same time, they don't want new.  It's a picture painted of consumers who have money but no interest in just lobbing it about on any old crap, in other words, the worst punters to try and flog stuff to as they aren't going to be easy to hype up into a buying frenzy.  Which is exactly why manufacturers have failed to manipulate used values in their favour and there is actually some form of free market in used EV prices.  Long May that continue."

They aren't generally the group who can switch as of yet and just have to wait until those who can and who are willing to do so create the infrastructure they will eventually require.   Nor do we as taxpayers want to be paying that bill. It's a bill that the ZEV Mandate shoves firmly into the overseas car manufacturers who if they want to maintain access to the highly lucrative U.K. consumer market must delve into their own pockets and pay for this infrastructure because if they don't then we won't buy their goods and they're not going to get their performance bonuses.

I just investigated my iPace, it has a 90kwh battery but apparently uses just 81.5kwh 100->0%So it's keeping a little chunk tucked away, I would guess when it says 100% charged there are in fact cell clusters that are less then fully charged, and those clusters will be rotated each charge cycle so they're all fully cycled in turn but not all always held at full capacity - or whatever the best way to manage them is! I don't think we need to understand the science to understand that there is something more advanced and calculated occuring than us yanking the plug out when the display says '80%'."

 And for those advocating not using 100% every time, or leaving it fully charged, or leaving it at v.low charge....where does your info come from?The internet Google it a bit and it's fairly common knowledge that the manufacturers are holding back some capacity to give headroom for cell cycling. We're told we should all cycle the battery in our smart phones to avoid degradation occurring too rapidly, hardly any of us actually do it of course.. But it works and has a positive effect.All EV's have a BMS, some will be better than others but they all seek to manage the charge and discharge rate of the cells in an optimal fashion to extend their lives. It's not just the extra 5-10% headroom some EV's are known to have (I suspect virtually all will have headroom but not all are the focus of much interest so it's hard to get info), the BMS can also charge and discharge cells on the fly whilst in use via regen. It just has to keep track of the charge state and usage of each cluster of cells and it can treat them as kindly as possible.Here's some interesting reading: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/drive/mobility/art...I do wonder why some car manufacturers and experts are saying that charging to 100% makes no appreciable difference (as in the link above), whereas others say only to do so ahead of a long trip. I can only imagine that it's because it doesn't inconvenience them one bit if their customers only charge to 80% so they might as well encourage it if it makes only the tiniest positive difference in terms of battery life, residual values of their products and might even save a few battery warranty claims - that's all I can think of. But as an owner I'll charge to 100% anytime I think there's even a possibility I might need all the range, because not doing so could inconvenience me.But anyway, real world evidence shows endless old Tesla's that have been rapid charged their entire life, probably often to 100% as rapid charging is fast and more importantly free for the earlier cars, so I imagine most owners fill their boots and take all the free power they can cram into their car whenever they do need to top up. Some of these cars are approaching 200k miles now and are a decade old."

I appreciate however the the Leaf may not be a good example in terms of battery deg etc compared to other more modern EVs.The earlier Leafs did suffer quite considerable deg, not just due to charging habits but the very basic cooling arrangement doesn't help. Then on top of quite high battery deg you start with a limited range to begin with so it's not a great combo.Most longer range EV's now have more sophisticated battery management, pre-conditioning and smart and efficient temperature control via heat pumps, which is why ten year old examples are between 5%, at most up to around 10% down based on all the various factors that can influence battery life.Probably why there's no cheap 'shed' Tesla's knocking about yet. They're all still essentially working pretty much as they did the day they were new and no looming end in sight in terms of significant range reduction so far."

Turns up in a ratty 4x4 Panda and park it next to the ubiquitous GT4s and Mclarens, and you’re a legend. Great shout that one. I agree with you, seeing something like a survivor Renault 5, or a 205, is cooler. But I just think I like survivor cars.Having a supercar just means your a car nerd. Or far worst, just showy off rich, and have no idea about the car you have. I'm a car nerd, and I appreciate it. But I've never been cool.For example, I remember seeing a Bugatti type 57sc atlantic a few years ago. It was an amazing car, but I knew what it was. But I do wonder if the general public would just think he was a rich pri*k, or just a really old car. Sometimes its hard to see things how non-petrolheads see things.I was chatting to some of the younger ones at work about cars a few weeks ago.  These are young graphic designers, sales, marketing people in their early to mid 20's. (I work in a completely different side of the company, on the manufacturing / engineering side of things). They all seemed to like Tesla's, were as I don't really like them that much. But they would be the ""in"" crowd.(I think of electric car drivers as a bit like the old south park about hybrids and smug).

The 500E, RS2 and Lotus Carlton are certainly ""Petrolhead"" cool if you know what they are but to many, they're just an old Merc/Audi/Vauxhall and if you have to explain to someone why they're special then you've already lost. Quattroporte and AM Rapide possibly get the closest but then arguably there are cooler coupe/convertible stablemates. Saloons and estates also rarely achieve the values of their more desirable coupe/convertible counterparts.2) Hot hatches aren't cool. I'm a big fan and again the 147 GTA is ""Petrolhead"" cool but again you would probably have to explain to many why it's special and there are cooler Alfas. The one possible exception is the mk1 Golf GTi and latterly the Up! GTi possibly. The mk1 Golf GTi was a big deal for VW, everyone knows what it is and it mixed sports car performance with family car affordability and practicality when those attributes were largely mutually exclusive, that's pretty cool.3) The driver determines whether a car is cool or not. Can't a car be cool in its own right, otherwise it only takes one ""uncool"" driver to make it uncool? I would say a Ferrari 250 GT California is a very cool car but Chris Evans owns one, so does that make it uncool? I agree though that mass adoption of a car by uncool people can make a cool car uncool. Think mk1 Audi TT or mk1 Range Rover Sport.4) A cool driver can make any car cool. I think that I'm possibly a generation too young to comprehend why Steve McQueen is the King of Cool. I have watched Bullitt and Le Mans but I still don't quite get it. Could he really make a Ssangyong Rodius or a Chrysler Crossfire cool though?5) Good point on cool being spec sensitive, especially with newer vehicles. An old TD5 Defender with a bit of well-used patina is quite cool but if it has been lifted and pimped out ""Urban"" spec then less so. Likewise a tastefully specced Range Rover is quite a cool car but easy to ruin if specced in white with 22"" black wheels, dark glass all round and red leather.6) Convertibles can't be cool??? I don't really get this. I would say the coolest car ever probably is a coupe or convertible and certainly most pre-war stuff were convertibles and in many cases, the convertible version is the more desirable variant of many vehicles.  Blower Bentley, SL Pagoda, 280 SE Convertible, Alfa Spider Duetto, original Fiat 124 Spider, AC Cobra, DS Decapotable, 356 Speedster, Carrera GT, even an OG Mustang Convertible are all cool cars in my book.In my view, the non-negotiable cool cars are still the Miura, S1 E-Type FHC, SL Pagoda and original AM Vantage. The classic (unmodified) Defender, Mini Cooper and Type 2 bus are also iconic and cool, even if they are flawed in many respects.Those cars are all quite identifiable but I also can get on board with the eye-catching but unadorned cars suggested where people would find them striking but not necessarily know what they are. The Fiat Dino Coupe is a good example of this, the only downside being the Fiat badge for some.My own experience with the Type 2 was with a 1978 bay window that I rented for a long weekend travelling around the West Country. Certainly not fast but it kept up with the traffic flow when you wound it up and I even managed to maintain 70mph on the motorway on the way back for a period of time. It was surprisingly enjoyable to drive, handling and riding quite well and easy to maintain momentum through the bends with excellent visibility. The only downside being if you hit a steep hill, it really struggled. If I were to get one a sympathetic Subaru/Porsche Flat 4/Flat 6 or EV conversion would be a consideration to make it more useable but other than that, I loved it and the overall experience maintained it as a cool car in my eyes."

 Well done, a daunting task way above my bodgit and scarper electrical knowledge.Sadly deterioration went unnoticed on my 320 coupe (stlll here) before damage resulted, must be some 14 years ago now,  one of the coils shorted out which blew the ECU as well, looking at something like a £3k bill for all new parts, new wiring loom and coils fitted by my indy, i managed to get the ECU repaired by the people on the Isle of Wight.Note for you just in case...this was the 2nd E320 W124 blown ECU i'd had repaired, first one a different issue, the IoW people repaired the first one fine not cheap though and clever clogs here thought he could get the 2nd one done cheaper elsewhere, it got sent to both extreme sides of the country to no avail, one cheeky blighter offered to bin it for me to save the return postage, he was obviously after the rare parts within.Kicked myself and sent it to the IoW people who repaired it and 14 years later its running fine, lessons learned as the politicians say (at no cost to them), one lesson being a clever looking website means the square root of sod all.Thanks for the heads-up re the ECU. I have replaced mine - for some reason, about 5 years ago, the car suddenly stopped revving over 3000rpm. I matched the serial number with one for sale on Ebay from Lithuania of all places. It worked (as the vendor promised it would), and I was a happy bunny again!"

 Personally I would god forward a handful of years and get the E39 M5, better in every way as a drivers car, and about half the cost (i am a little biased)!)For me this E500 for me sits on the fence of being a useless car with current prices: too valuable to be driven as daily and not fun enough to be driven for sake of it, whilst not good looking or rare enough to become a ""museum piece"" show car. It isnt a homologation special, it doenst have a special engine, it has an old slush auto box.... I will swim against the current here and say I have not interest in this car.

 I can’t decide if I like it or not. They’re a very odd, slightly awkward looking car.I've never liked the way it looks to be fair. It looks like a 5 year old has designed it(I'm not sure if that was deliberate/the plan by Alfa though). Being left hand drive was always going to limit it's appeal in the UK as well I think(although my dad had a LHD 5.0 Mustang for 10 years mostly without issue/he did moan about struggling to see that easily when overtaking stuff in it)."

 When I was quite young my parents explained to me what are called the facts of life. When they had finished, my father said to me ""one more thing, if you see a car that you like and it has an Alfa-Romeo badge on the front, look at it, admire it, but do not buy it.""His advice has stood me in good stead over the years.That was probably ""sensible"" from a prejudiced stance, and then you missed out on the essense of what makes a car utterly compelling as a fun, all immersive driving experience. A BMW for example, simply would not come close to offering the same level of excitement and pleasure of driving. Having owned three Alfa's, my personal experience has been that none of them, from 1975 GTV, 155 Twinspark and the 147 GTA caused me any real trouble compared to my BMW 3 series which was not only a bore to drive, but had more mechanical problems. I’ve had Modern era BMW, Mercedes, Audi,Peugeot, Ford, Vauxhall, Honda,Mitsubishi, Subaru.  I now have Alfa Romeo - nowhere near the most unreliable car I’ve ever had (Audi A5 by a mile if you are wondering!)."

 Can I ask about SS and higher earner's additional benefit. I understand that between 100k and 125k of earnings for every £2 over 100k £1 is lost from personal allowance until the point that 12.5k allowance is fully eroded at 125k (or there abouts). When the personal allowance is lost you pay 20% on the 12.5k so 2.5k to pay in additional tax at 125k.So if quoted a car that is net 500/mnth upto 100k, (tusker not providing a net sum for sums above 100k), at 125k is the sum as easy as the net amount of 500 /mnth less (2500/12) 208 so the actual net 'cost' of car could be said to be  292/mnth?  Or have I got it wrong?Edited by Durhamlandy1 on Thursday 15th February 22:32
My understanding is the easiest way to work out the Net cost is take 62% from the monthly gross reduction (quoted on the tusker quote summary) and then add the BIK.  This gives you the actual effect on take home pay.That's what I did.they typically show the NET amount at 40 and 45 percent.BUT it is a higher rate in the 100-125 rate, equivalent of 62 per cent, so use that.£1,000 gross is equiv of £380 and then the BIK to add to that.I also assumed the cost of insurance and took that off as well to get the 'hire cost' of the car."

 New to this thread, apologies if this has been covered somewhere before, but not time to go through all 68 pages.Has anyone done a personal / business lease, then SS without going through one of the many (expensive it seems) schemes? We are a small business, just looking at one or two cars possibly, don't need the 'extras' that some seem to charge, so I don't see why we can't lease direct from any lease company at a better rate, then just do the adjustments on PAYE, like we do with pension. Am I missing something? Unfortunately, most info online seems to be from companies offering schemes, which doesn't help.It's worth checking out Drive Electric - they offer a salary sacrifice scheme that compares very well to Octopus and Tusker, and you can tailor the scheme to take only the bits you need, things like early termination insurance can be dropped.https://www.drive-electric.co.uk/business/services..."

They definitely fluctuate on ours. 18 months ago a Taycan was £650 net and now is a few kid shy of £1400. Assume it’s a mix of available deals, residuals and insurance costs (as they need to price it to cover all qualifying employees).After a test drive I wasn’t interested 18 months ago and I’m not interested now. Only decent deals are Tesla Model Y and the MG hot hatch. I wanted a Fiat 500e or electric Mini (for Mrs S rather than me) but PCP or PCH are massively cheaper. I guess the only exception would be if you were young and insurance ran into thousands per year - which was the main reason I had company cars in my 20s.

But I think now the Honda-e is too expensive for its range, which is presumably why Honda are no longer making them.

 Well, that p***ed on my chips.  I've regularly said that changes are never made retrospectively, they usually aren't. When the huge jump in VED for vehicles over 225g/km emissions was announced on budget day 2006, it only applied FROM that day, 26/03/06. But here, cars registered between April 2017 and 2025 that are currently £0 due to being zero emission will become 'standard' rate, currently £165 p.a. From 2001 to 2017, they become £20 p.a. which seems miniscule in the scheme of things, not just the amount but because there are very few pre 2017 zero-emission cars, relatively. All those electric vehicles over £40k list will be paying a LOT of VED for 5 years.... they can afford it. Edited to add: Us motorcyclists get a raw deal, again. I have to pay £101 for a >600cc bike already, and if I go electric, it will be £22 per year from 2025! So, a 125cc stinky one will be the same??  Commercial electrics get a right clobbering, up to £290 p.a.Edited by sixor8 on Thursday 17th November 13:40
But it says cars in Band A which pay £0 will move into Band B and pay £20 - This will effect all of the <99g/km diesels as well as the electric zero emitters so probably a decent amount of vehicles."

If according to the government 50% of cars will be electric by 2025 (I very much doubt that) then where's the loss of fuel duty coming from?I would imagine they mean 50% of new car sales, which sounds just optimistic but just about plausible not 50% of cars on the road, which sounds impossible! If 50% of new cars are EV by 2025, 80+% of cars on the road will still be ICE at that point. But yes, I'm sure they're already thinking about the best mechanism to recoup the loss of fuel duty."

I relish a good long trip in it. Here is the thread on my latest: https://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&...My £1,200 H plate 300E was the best though.

My perfect combo would be smoke silver which is my favourite colour on old merc's and dark brown MB-Tex. Lovely car and nice thread to read.

Has anyone here had one and run one relatively regularly? (ie not quite as a daily but using it as a main car). Best 2door shape Merc ever made imo, and a soundtrack to die for...Yes you're correct, I picked up a couple of cheap ones ( 420 SEC's ) 2 years ago when I was away on holiday £2400 for both, bought them both unseen mainly as a parts bin but they were better than I was expecting and both were and are running well even now but are in reality small project cars but not worth me doing them.I've had in the region of 25 SEC's and still have 4 + the 2 above ( 420's ). A 420, 2 x 500's ( 1 x series 1 and 1 x series 2 ) and a 560.Every now and then they pop up but I haven't seen a sensibly priced one without needing a 2nd mortgage to sort it. Some 560's command well into 5 figures with some beginning with 3!They are the same as the 4 door in reality, the way they drive and the spec and comfort. They just waft away, back in the 80's and 90's they were considered powerful cars but a VW golf is quicker now. What I have found when driving mine is that there's some sort of sense of occasion driving it, the car feels very stately, very smooth, can never describe it properly or work it out.

 Yes you're correct, I picked up a couple of cheap ones ( 420 SEC's ) 2 years ago when I was away on holiday £2400 for both, bought them both unseen mainly as a parts bin but they were better than I was expecting and both were and are running well even now but are in reality small project cars but not worth me doing them.I've had in the region of 25 SEC's and still have 4 + the 2 above ( 420's ). A 420, 2 x 500's ( 1 x series 1 and 1 x series 2 ) and a 560.Every now and then they pop up but I haven't seen a sensibly priced one without needing a 2nd mortgage to sort it. Some 560's command well into 5 figures with some beginning with 3!They are the same as the 4 door in reality, the way they drive and the spec and comfort. They just waft away, back in the 80's and 90's they were considered powerful cars but a VW golf is quicker now. What I have found when driving mine is that there's some sort of sense of occasion driving it, the car feels very stately, very smooth, can never describe it properly or work it out.

Regarding your last point, I did exactly that with my 740i and generally have a pretty can-do attitude with buying cars, but Mercs are completely new to me and I do really love my E38 so I'd want to make sure I don't do the wrong thing jumping into an SEC.

 There was a 560SE - lhd only as you say, and made in tiny numbers.  1,200 global sales vs nearly 1m total W/C/V 126 built.  It really is the sweet spot - monster engine and the more agile swb chassis (and more elegant).  If you don't mind sitting on the wrong side, one for sale here...I was getting all excited - that really is a bit of me and I am only considering retiring the wonderful Lexus because LHD is really useful for me.  But 39 thousand of Europe's finest caused a bit of a gulp, and the SOLD banner provided some relief.  At 25 grand, I'd probably have bought that."

 Do any of you threadists have reader's threads on your older Mercs?I had convinced myself I wanted an LS400 for commuting - fauxMerc looks with reliability - but the more I look at them the more I want an older Mercedes.I've had a W202 and a W203, both sold on to family members, but I think maybe a W124 or W123 is what I need as a daily driver. For me the W202 is probably the last of the proper classic styled Mercs saloons that I love.You've had a lot of really good advice already, and there is a lot of MB experience here to tap into.  I've had a 124 estate and a cabrio, a 190, a 500 SL (R129) and a 560 SEC.  Some of those cars are now owned by other threadists.  I have loved them all and still have a 1973 350 SLC: https://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&...I'd echo that a 123 might be a challenging daily but a 124 is very do-able, even now.  Do buy carefully though, they need love as they get older and buying a neglected car will cost you.  Northbrook's thread is well worth following, and you'll see from r129sl's threads that preventative, proactive and regular maintenance is key.  As others have said, buy carefully.  But - also as 0a and others have said - they are terrifically rewarding cars to own and drive.  I now daily drive (and do regular long road trips in) a 2002 Lexus LS 430 and am a big fan, but there's no doubt that driving an old Mercedes offers considerably more cred than a Partridge-esque fat Jap.  On the plus side, the LS gives one the coveted green digital clock and the DNA link with the uber-desirable SC430."

My dad owned 5 or 6 of them, can't remember exactly how many off the top of my head and I've kept them on. Some beautifully engineered machines and some I'd describe as immaculate, some decent, some good, some average and one or 2 are especially crap.They get serviced every year properly by my "" the man "" who is retired, but now only solely works on my cars on behalf of my dad with whom he was best friends with. They all have a valid MOT where needed, they all get driven each month at least by me or some of my close mates and family. They are all insured and taxed.It costs me a lot of money every month keeping up with it all and time too.I've probably unwittingly created a bit of curiosity by this. I wont be doing threads, I've no interest in it, prefer to read than write but this is for anyone who loves mercs like I do.Sidenote on 124's - We are between us trying to kill a 1995 124 E220 at the moment but no matter how we bad hammer it, it just wont die and refuses to fail an MOT, refuses to break down and even on soft off road stuff the suspension will not snap or break. Four of us are trying to kill it by driving it ( not crashing etc ) and the winner gets the logbook and gets to keep it and they have to keep it too!!! We've snapped a poly V belt and had one puncture and one light bulb fail in roughly 18 months of torturing it! We don't service or do anything to it at all. It is properly road legal and not in a dangerous condition etc.Anyway I'm off for a trip away for the weekend for my anniversary with the woman."

I was a bit too slow off the mark to get a new Honda e:Ny1 from the Brindley group. They put up an offer on Friday of a £44k list price car with £179 deposit and 23 months at £179. Honda pay the £8k deposit. By yesterday afternoon, they'd all gone.  6k miles per year. Balloon payment £27k, yeah right like they'll be worth that after 2 years. It gets average reviews, not as good as Kia or Hyundai EVs (equivalent models) but at £179 p.m. I'm sure it's acceptable.  Word is, they had lots of black cars to shift, all other colours were extra and its now £229 p.m.Now the little E has been withdrawn, I think it's their only EV product in Europe, so the zero emissions mandate will probably mean many others having to heavily discount.ETA: l found out about it on the leasing deals thread, plenty on there got in quicker than me.Edited by sixor8 on Tuesday 27th February 07:11"

I think the reviews are probably right that it's not the best EV but for regular non car folks it'll be like most cars i.e. a bit average.  She's unlikely to care as it'll do the job.It's not really a £45k car but a £37k one due to the £8k discount.

If the weather is good get the bus either north to Corralejo or south to Caleta de Fuste - neither are fabulous but either is a hell of a lot better than Puerto del Rosario even if all you are doing is going somewhere for a drink and to swim in the sea.Arrecife in Lanzarote is slightly less grim than Puerto del Rosario, but that isn't saying much. Most people seem to take a stroll around the 'puddle' which is a small tidal area with some dinghies and with a few bars around, because frankly there isn't much more to see and really unless you are hiring a car there is nothing to see on any bus routes.Funchal is probably the pick of the bunch as there is quite a lot to see and do in the town without needing to venture any further."

I'm already forgetting what we did . Fuerteventura was pretty dire - especially as we were there on a windy Sunday. We caught the #12 at Gran Ganaria and wandered around as advised. Pretty straight forward.Arrecife ... it was okay enough for a stroll - and I don't think we were docked long enough for a car rental. Funchal was lovely - very clean. First time visiting Madeira, and I think we'd like to return. We did an excursion which included a trip on the cable car, a descent on the wicker baskets and then a wander around the botanical gardens. We quite enjoyed this. We did an excursion at Las Palma too, but it was overcast and windy so we didn't get to see the views. We might want to visit again in the future. What was very noticeable in most of the port cities was how vibrant the 'high streets' are still. Not only cruise ship passengers, but locals out and about - with normal shops still trading. A stark contrast to the boarded up UK high streets. The cruise itself had a very budget feel to it. I'd rate it as only 'okay'. If we were to go on another one, maybe we'd spend a little more and choose something a little more upmarket. It wasn't cheap though - certainly if you add all of the additional spending. It was good in terms of having activities laid on that we could coerce our 12 year old daughter to participate in - normally she'd want to be locked up in a hotel room with a phone/tablet.Unfortunately I seem to have returned with a cold.Edited by Chris Type R on Sunday 14th April 09:14"

A stark contrast to the boarded up UK high streets. I suspect part of that is weather-driven - warm and sunny makes you want to be outside, unlike the average UK weekend.  Part is cultural - Spain still feels a more social country, probably helped by being able to live more of their life outdoors, and by having less of the 'hustle culture' that's invading the UK from the US.  And part is tourism helping keep it all going - e.g. Stratford upon Avon still has a very busy town centre (less so on cold / wet autumn/winter days), but interestingly there the big stores have all closed down and it's 80% restaurants, cafes and niche or tourist-tat shops.

 All this stereotyping stuff is such bullst. You can apply a bad stereotype to any car you like if want to.Ferrari: Chav lottery winners and footballersBentley: Orange people and footballers Lambo: You like to drive around Knightsbridge revving the tits off it.Aston Martin: man child 007 wanna bee.Rolls Royce: Gangsta rapper.Range Rover: Drug dealer or rapper.All of these are un true for 99% of owners and most people don't think that way about brands. You can twist anything to have a bad image if you want. On the flip side you could say nice things about all of the above as well.

I have driven many BMW's over the years, petrol, diesel, M Cars, X5...2 Series Active Tourer (Let's not dwell on that one) and every time got out of them wondering what all the fuss is about. There was one exception though the E46 (had to look that up) M3 CSL. They are a good car, but so are many others on the road. Do BMW make the best handling saloon on the road today? Do they have the best build quality? Best reliability? I don't think today you can say yes to any of those questions. Back in the 80's (yes I'm getting on) they were a class above but they were priced that way. Order a 3 series in the mid 80s and you had to pay extra for a radio. Not today.So I cannot see why there is such love for them."

Say it were a 2 year old Nissan Leaf, that no one buys for the tech, and you just want to use for the local 50 mile commute.  It wouldn't matter to you if the entire world had moved on in a few years.Or you could be tech savvy, and don't want a car that doesn't have the latest wizzy bits.  You don't just do a short local commute and need something as efficient and rangey as poss.  If it's the later rent it.  If it's the former, buy it.Just my 2p"

My budget aligns closely with the original poster's, though it's easy to exceed. I've done some research on overall costs and compiled a list of cars below, including ownership expenses over 12 and 36 months.I've based the EV charging rates on my current Octopus average tracker rate, rather than opting for a dedicated EV tariff with potentially higher daytime rates. For comparison, a lower kWh rate of £0.07 would amount to £105 for the year.Insurance costs are nudging the Tesla out for me (mid 50's with clean licence).Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated."

If you love something like a Honda-E (life is so short, why overthink your purchase!) then get it as long as you are comfortable that it may take longer to sell in x years time given the minority of used car buyers who would be looking for something like that."

So, PCP looks an appealing option even at 8 or 9% APR. What would you do? Finance or cash?I'm leaning towards the ID3 or the e208 currently.A finance deal doesn't avoid the cost of depreciation, it only avoids the cost of unexpected depreciation.  The financier will have an expected residual value for the car at the end of the deal and will charge you the difference spread over the term, to cover their costs.  The benefit is that if depreciation turns out to be steeper than they expect, it's their problem not yours.However in this case we're talking about buying a car that has already suffered heavy depreciation from its new list price.  So they aren't that expensive to buy in now, and there's no particular reason to expect a further big loss of value.On that basis I bought an e-C4 for £14k last Nov outright.  I'm aware it will depreciate being a newish car, but if it's worth half that in 3-4 years time, I'd be ok with that.Old Leafs and things are still useful as local runabouts, so I don't see these sort of cars becoming entirely worthless."

 That's the crazy thing - why isn't this angle pushed? The long running thread on PH about petrol price madness and when will it end? - The title itself suggests a significant number of people think the price of fossil fuels will come down... when will the penny drop that it is only going one way and that as a nation we need to get the majority away from it to avoid people being unable to afford to move? The fact we're so well positioned in the UK to take advantage of renewable energy and gain wealth just adds to the bizarreness of it all Not many would have grasped the concept too readily until the last couple of years when they've experienced first hand the financial instability from excessive exposure to the USD and the oil market but the real reason is that it's been easier while money was worthless and slipping around to pitch the fluffy polar bear stuff and have people buy in. Interestingly, post Uxbridge there appears to be an interesting swing away from that failing pitch and an acceptance of the reality that people would club a thousand baby seals for some nectar points. 2050 is a burden but in contrast to our economic peers who failed/chose not to de-industrialise back in the 20th century and face that immense cost and upheaval now, along with our far, far easier path to renewables (note our perfect geographical position, perfect geology we really should have been pitching economic freedom from the USD and Oil to the poorer people in the U.K. rather than patronising, scaring and ignoring them. The latter part the Conservatives appear to have finally listened to and are switching to using in a vain attempt to not get a deserved kicking at the upcoming GE. On this thread alone you can see the instant pushback against 'stop burning stuff' because of its preachy, patronising sales pitch and its wilful ignoring of those less fortunate than themselves.  They could carry the exact same message but sell it as dollar and oil economic freedom and the financial stability that comes from that and get support from the very people who rightfully push back against the patronising twaddle of religious loons and grifters.

 In time non dealer EV specialists capable of battery swaps etc will increase in number, the subsequent competition will start to pull prices down. It could take quite some time though as there is already a significant skills shortfall as not enough people working on cars are trained to deal with the high voltage systems.In the mean time, if battery swaps are too expensive to be justified by the value of the EV in question, all that will happen is that EV will lose value far more rapidly as it approaches the ten year/100k mile mark. The market will make a risk/value judgement which will determine the used value of the cars. If a battery swap was in the future far cheaper, such cars would maintain a greater value for longer.As it stands even body shops have been slow to get staff trained to deal with high voltage EV systems so it's not surprising that we don't yet have several competing battery swap shops in each town.One things for sure, if hundreds of thousands of EV are being scrapped each year when they could, with an affordable battery swap be worth £10k, that massive amount of potential value will attract businesses to look at how they can both realise that value and profit from doing so. Manufacturers could also help by signing up national auto repair centre chains as approved partners, with training etc. But really no one is going to do anything much in that direction until there are hundreds of thousands of EV's appearing each year that are old enough to provide regular custom for such services. It's all just a bit new at the moment.Indeed. We know this is very likely to be the case at some point in the future but the precise point being made is that people are asking for numbers but getting words.  Case in point being that your post, which I grew with pretty much entirely fails to answer the question being asked. It does not contain a single iota of relevant data.  That's the point being made.  As EVs come off their consumer debt cycles they start to be acquired by people who have a different way at looking at value and money and further down the line at the level PH refers to as sheds you have millions and millions of car owners that we absolutely know cannot afford to replace a battery pack, cannot afford for a car to deteriorate rapidly and statistically are the most reliant on their cars and covering the higher mileages. It's all well and good saying that certain things should happen in the future but we can already see with quite robust clarity from factual financial and demographic data that there is somewhat of an issue looming.  And some people asking for clarity serves as a warning for those who hear as opposed to those who don't wish to. Read back, the point I was making was that no dependable numbers or stats exist yet, and for that reason, buyers acquiring the cars towards the (potential) end of battery life will therefore be willing to only pay a small amount - limited buyer confidence will cause the cars to depreciate faster beyond a certain age.That sounds terrible for the cars 2nd/3rd owners who might lose a chunk due to the car ageing... but once running costs are factored in for their ownership, there may well not be very much in it Vs ice depreciation plus running costs for the same period.It's also a likely a temporary problem as we will (hopefully) learn that most EV's don't require a battery swap until they're approaching the age that value would be extremely low for any car, which makes the risk of financial loss very low. We need thousands of each make and model of each EV to pass the 10 year/100k mark before we can get any worthwhile data. People may ask for it sooner... but plainly they can't be give figures which don't yet exist.No one actually needs to take a risk thoigh, ice sheds for the masses will be around for at least another 20 years, more than enough time to sort battery swapping costs etc."

 And lets be right. The percentage of ICE cars that need a full replacement engine rather than infrequent relatively cheap repair part within 20 years must be very low. And if when so, in regards to 'normal' run of the mill stuff - Astra/Focus etc.. its a very cheap job (hundreds not thousands) to replace an engine with a good used unit from a salvage. And they do go on for thousands of miles more.It's quite possible to repair/refurbish a battery as well, but we're only talking about battery replacement, so we should only talk about full engine replacement."

Would you also use a tiny engine in remote controlled plane to benchmark how long your car engine might last?Yes, if it was the same type of engine.My cars are multi-cylinder four-stroke units. Model aero engines are little glow plug engines, usually single cylinder, which are completely different technology.My phone's battery is the same technology as the hybrid car I am looking at.Electric/Hybrid cars are not for you. Buy an ICE."

And here is its battery, such a scary beast, in all its glory.30 million cars travelling 240 billion miles averaging 7 miles/kWh would bring the total grid demand to just 35 TWh, a little over 10% increase in today's overall UK demand.Now think of the colossal savings that brings to the amount of charging and grid infrastructure required. The future is ALL about energy efficiency.The world's best hydrogen fuel cell car weighs more than the car above, has the same amount of interior space, yet it can only achieve just over 1 mile per kWh.Try the same thing with the Mirai rather than the Merc and now you need to find 200+ TWh of electricity.Simply ridiculous idea.This. I've mentioned it before in other EV discussion threads, the efficiency of EVs barely gets mentioned. As said above, if 7m/kWh were the norm, batteries could be much smaller and lighter.I'm old enough to remember the average fuel consumption of a typical 1.6 Cortina being about 25 mpg.We wouldn't accept that in a Focus, or whatever the equivalent is today, yet people seem oblivious to their EVs only managing 2 - 3 m/kWh."

This is why old Jag's drop in value like a stone, because all sorts of mechanical issues are likely and any number of them could immediately exceed the value of the car.In general the same can be said for both EV and ICE cars, but in the case of EV, the potential cost to replace a battery is currently particularly nerve wracking as the simply isn't data to suggest how likely it is that it will need replacing at a given age/mileage, there is also no established third party network to do the job at an affordable price.As for the future of EV's, and to an extent all modern cars no longer catering towards banger drivers... I agree. I think the powers that be are very happy not to cater to that slice of the market."

When you look at how many finely machined components there are to go wrong in a typical engine and (frequently automatic) gearbox, it's undeniably more complex. I'm surprised that batteries suddenly go downhill, because all the real world degradation curves I've seen show faster degradation at first which then stabilises. I've seen some theoretical curves which show initial degradation followed by stabilisation and then a faster (but still linear) decline close to end of life, but I haven't seen any of those for real world data. Maybe we don't have enough high mileage cars to see it yet."

 It's a mistake to look only at the lifetime in miles or number of charge cycles.Time is often a bigger killer of batteries.Also the 'wear factors' inter-act.Temperature matters, fast charge and discharge isn't ideal, as a battery gets older, its efficiency suffers so there is more heating, and as its capacity falls, every cycle becomes a deeper discharge, faster in terms of c-rate.Telsa and others are keen to tell you about cars which have done a few hundred thousand miles, and that's great.But they've generally done that mileage in a small number of years.It's also a mistake to assume that a 2024 battery will degrade in the same way as a 2014 battery does.Obviously we can only have real life examples of 10 year old batteries that were manufactured in 2014.Here is a more recent Tesla study based on over 500 cars. https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/study-real-life-tesla...There is nothing in there that hints that a 10 year old battery on 70,000 miles is about to expire.It all points to reaching at least 125,000 miles, regardless of age.I believe that the trend will be for the degradation curves to flatten as time goes on due to technology and QA improvements.The  deg v age chart there seems to suggest it's unlikly a 15 year old car would have lost more than 20-25% of it's range on average. Realistically that's scrap age for a lot of cars right now, and certainly a brand new EV bought today that could do 250 real world miles, would still be perfectly useful if it can do 180-200 miles when it's 15 years old."

 I'd never heard of a RHD until Mike Brewer mentioned it on WD, but he is known for getting his facts wrong. The conversions you mention also used Fiat parts for the Lancia conversion i believe!?RHD conversion was also done by John Whalley. They had to use steering rack from a normal Delta as the Intergrale had its own. I owned one for a while in the nineties. It was a very nice car but after buying it I regretted going for a RHD conversion. Even more so now because when we drive back to the UK (in our LHD car) I don't really have problems a....except for car parks of course, where I make sure the wife is with me to deal with the ticket machines!http://www.whalley-integrale.uk.com/"

 Most of us can only go on what we read - but what people generally say about the 8C is actually pretty consistent.It has a bone-hard ride but wallows in corners - more than one person desribed it as feeling like a muscle car.It's engine is lazy and does nothing unless you stir it (Evo joked you'd need a downhill slope to get close to it's claimed 0-60)The gearbox is a horrible/lazy flappy-paddle effort which changes gear when it feels like it.It's not built that well - yes, it's an Alfa but it cost over £100K and bits falling-off is less acceptable at that price The driving position is less than ideal (usually blamed on RHD conversions - what the excuse is here I've no idea)It's horrendously impractical - not a massive concern to most people but still...These may all be untrue but they come up time and time again so I'd surprised if there's not a seam of truth running through them - and reality is that the cars mostly seem to be taking up trader showroom space and not road space.I don't remember reading much of the above when the car was launched. I just had a quick check on Autocar, Car and Evo reviews I found (available on the net) and they were generally quite positive, although it was recognised that dynamically the Alfa wasn't the best car available. Which reviews are you referring to that are so much more negative?Anyway, my point is more that car journalists generally drive cars to the limit (often on a test track) and are also paid to write something interesting and different about each car they drive (they wouldn't last long if all they could say is ""yes, another great car""). For the average driver, who uses a car normally I am sceptical whether there is much difference (dynamically) between an 8c and a F430 and that the the difference in aesthetics, noise, perceived quality and brand snobbery would play a much larger role in whether the Alfa or Ferrari are preferred."

 I'll never understand why so many people are put off buying a vehicle because the steering wheel is on the other side of the vehicle. Get a mate to come with you when you pick it up to keep an eye on your driving and give you a poke if you start to drift into sitting behind the right hand tail lamp of the car in front on the motorway. Be prepared to bang your left hand into the door a few times early on when you think of changing gear, but really, it's a couple of weeks if you drive daily and you'll never look back.The reason why I mentioned I wouldn’t want an 8C in this country (due to it being LHD) has little to do with not being physically able to drive it (I drive LHD on the continent all the time)If i were in a position to own one of these, I would be the person that used it LOTS and then I would just be annoyed every time I needed to enter or exit a car park or toll booth, if I wanted a sly McDonalds drive through, when I was exiting a slip road but most importantly that I wouldn’t be able to safely pick my overtaking opportunities on single carriageway roads.It's all the above that have stopped me pulling the trigger on an E30 M3 and a Mercedes 500e and a V8 engined Alpina E36."

Which reviews are you referring to that are so much more negative?You won't actually find a huge amount written about the 8C because it seems the press only got to drive it on Alfa's ""own"" track - not that many journos have driven the car 'properly' (in fact the only one I could find online was Top Gear!!)From Evo's first drive thoevo said: The delivery isn’t explosive and you’d need a peachy launch (and maybe a downhill slope) to match Alfa’s 4.2sec claim for the 0-62mph benchmark, but the 8C has long legs and it’s easy to believe the claimed 181mph top speed (in tests at Nardo it actually reached 186mph). However, all is not quite as the hard-ride and wonderfully rorty exhaust would have you believe. Push harder and the body control starts to unravel, body- roll building quite rapidly and getting more exaggerated as each curve unfolds.

 As a handy urban runabout, I quite like that. But, Manufacturers; please please please stop with the iPad controls! And apparently a complete lack of instruments in front of the driver, unless there’s a hud.Personally I think touch screen is less safe.  We become familiar with the locations of certain button, knobs etc so there is no need to take concentration away from the road.  Touch screen with layers is much less intuitive imo. I do really like the HUD  and voice control maybe a better option.Not only location familiarity, but the difficulty of hitting a specific part of a screen when the car is moving about is incredibly distracting. What is an effortless tap when the car is stationary becomes very hit and miss without deliberate concentration. I don't see much (if any) difference in the level of concentration or distraction involved whether using a touch screen when a car is in motion, or interacting with a hand held mobile phone. Both are far more distracting than pushing a physical switch or button which can be done by feel, and which has a physical presence that is much easier to connect with when the car is moving about.Touch screens in cars are a cost saving measure primarily. All those instruments, lights and physical buttons, and all the wiring that connects them can be replaced with a single, relatively cheap OLED panel (or two) and a vastly simplified wiring loom. Extrapolated over a production run, this represents a significant amount of money.By removing any instruments from in front of the driver, there's another cost saving in that both LHD and RHD markets can be catered for with the same parts.Touch screens are fantastic things, just not in cars, IMO."

I think the Honda e and the Ioniq 5 are great examples of designs that provoke strong emotional reactions and associations. They’re both quite retro, but you’re quite likely to equate retro to cool, or to naff and dated. In recent years I feel like Volvo have moved away from homely Nordic design to more minimalist restrained Scandi design. It’s sleeker and more modern, and that’s going to resonate with some people and not others. Both have character, it’s just that your appreciation of that character is dictated by your own personal tastes."

 Or acceleration! Manufacturers should spend more time trying to make an EV that has a higher range. Sure, most people won't need to drive 600 miles in one go everyday but it's nice to know that your fridge on wheels won't need charging for 3 weeks since you're only doing 10 mile journeys everyday with everything switched on (lights, heating/ac, radio etc).The range is largely a function of the battery capacity.  The longer the range the more the cost and weight.  Battery technology  is improving and will double/ triple over the next few years.  For most people doing typical day to day motoring the range is perfectly adequate.  For the relatively few that need a longer range then the best thing is to wait a few years.  By 2030 when it starts to matter the range will equal the ICE equivalents.I know why it is where it is but I don't want to plug it in for 8 hours. I want to plug it in for 3 minutes and then have full range available."

 OK, I'm out Little on PH surprises me anymore but you being repeatedly told (by someone who doesn’t have an EV) that your EV is broken because it doesn’t achieve what the manufacturers say it will, nor what a motoring magazine’s contrived testing says it will, is elite even for here.Mrs C and I have done 5000+ EV miles in the past couple of years in all weathers, and never once encountered col range issues like the TRM is describing. Does that not entitle me to an opinion?As for the ""contrived"" testing, I don't accept that unless you can find a better way to compare multiple cars like that in a short space of time. I thought their test covered the major real-world scenarios in cold weather, and would have expected the sort of significant range issues that TRM is describing to become apparent. The only car that performed anywhere near as badly as his was the Ora Funky Cat, which tells me that something isn't right with his Polestar. I simply don't accept that idea that he's presenting his experience as ""the real world"" when it's so easy to refute it."

 We have a C40 Ultimate and it doesn't get anywhere near its claimed range in real world driving, and its even worse in the cold weather. My wife's family are 160 miles away and she can't quite get there on a full charge, when she stops to recharge there is always a queue and as soon as she plugs in people are knocking on the window asking how long she will be. On anything other than local driving it is basically a pain to use. Needless to say we are getting rid of it.For balance we have a C40 Core so the lowest spec and single motor. Last week drove to Disneyland Paris and we got just over 200 miles with 10% remaining. We never queued once for a charger and the only issue was on our first stop two chargers were down, there was another 3 available and the next one worked fine. I was also very impressed with the charging speed. By the time we had taken the kids to the loo and bought some snacks, the car was ready to go again.Edited by J1mS on Friday 9th June 10:08"

 Almost everything hereinabove smacks of peacockery and codpiece. Real men don't feel the need to brag about it. A real man's car, surely, is a saloon or at a push a fixed head coupé. It is quiet, discreet and unassuming. It is ultra high quality and unquestionably reliable. And, of course, it is fast. None of the many cars presently on sale meets all of these criteria with the possible exception of the Maserati Quattroporte, which is somewhat spoiled by being unavailable in a tasetful specification and associated with those vulgar and excessive coupés.Cars which best represent the breed are:(1) Mercedes-Benz 500 E. But not with big wheels and blacked out windows.(2) Aston Martin V8 Vantage, Prince of Wales spec. Gunmetal Grey Metallic preferred.(3) Jaguar Sovereign Series III V12.(4) BMW M5 (E28 only, though). Not a red one.(5) Mercedes-Benz 300 SE L 6.3.(6) Mercedes-Benz 450 SE L 6.9.(7) Any front-engined V12 Ferrari with a manual transmission up to and including the 575M (but emphatically not the 599 which really is only for secretly gay Arab princes or men who wish they were secretly gay Arab princes), so long as it is neither red nor black nor upholstered in red leather. Fitment of an after market exhaust immediately disqualifies the vehicle from manly status. The manly Ferrari is a difficult one to pull off. As it were. A silver 412 upholstered in brown leather and fitted up with the 5 speed manual is the epitome of the man's Ferrari.I thought the OP wanted manly, you've gone for 'old manly'."

Fiat seem much closer to the mark with the 500e - both in size and range, albeit not price."

  We had an i3 a few years ago and she loved it but the problem is those pesky IC cars and the value they offer. We looked at EVs a couple of years ago but in the end came home with a heavily discounted brand new A6 Black Edition for less money. The A6 has space, comfort, relative performance and reliabilty. . ok , in the 4 years since you bought your A6, how much has it lost in depreciation?  My i3 cost me £16,200 4.5 years ago, with just 376 miles on the clock, ex-dealer demo. Today, it's still worth around £15,000,  I've never owned a car that's depreciated so little!  Add in the tiny 2.1 pence per mile total running costs and so say ""ICE offer value"" is frankly, simply not true ime  :-)ok, ok, i bought when not many people wanted an EV, and now people do, but given the constriction of supply of EVs, i think depreciation is going to remain low on them for a while yet?"

 Sight unseen, don't support any politically motivated battery car stuff. No more tolerance. Battery cars have only one goal: To limit individual mobility.So a device for personal transportation is being pushed to limit personal mobility by the government or some shady cabal ?A Tesla can, in the right circumstances do 300 miles on a charge, new battery tech is coming, can still buy ICE cars.Where do people get these ideas from, dont inflict your persecution complex on the rest of us.As for the car, as a middle aged bloke I should hate it, I dont, it looks pretty good and the range would be fine for me most of the time.But I can see how chaps of a similar ilk, maybe owning a 12 year old Passat diesel will say it wont go far enough, which is true but its not really a substitute for a diesel Saloon is it, yes its pricey but guess what, some people can afford it and can countenance spending all that on something nice even if it isnt the most for the least money."

 To be honest for 98% of the year this would work fine as an only car for us because we almost never do 100 miles in one day and we have a garage so could be charging it when not in use. However it would mean having to rent something else for the other 2% which could be a pain. If I were marketing this type of car I would think about having that facility ie owners get access to rental car for up to two weeks at preferential rates and they can be booked easily and delivered/picked up.I think this is the thinking a lot of people would go through. For those few times (2%), maybe something like Zipcar would be a solution.But then, we won't all be living in a world of whitegoods- on-wheels until it's time for fun, otherwise who would buy the truly mega cars?"

With an EV I can fuel it at home or anywhere with electricity, one of the most plentiful easiest things to get in a modern society.  I can even generate it at home if I like.

 My mother's Honda Jazz has less miles after 11 years than I put on my primary car in a year! For her all the mechanical gubbins are simply things that go wrong and many of us know the pitfalls of ultra low mileage cars - ICE like to be used. SO while of course this car is not aimed at me in any way - for my mother it is utterly perfect. The only issue is the price which seems high for what it is but then I am suffering from 'sticker shock' at the moment on all cars. Yes, it would suit my mum too - a second car in a retired family, that never really goes out of town. Except that her current ten year old runabout cost her two grand. I can see the attraction if you live and work in London, but not until every lamp post has a charging port, because very few people in London have a driveway. Another good point earlier about rental cars, that companies selling small city electric cars should have a deal to be able easily rent something for the weekend at a good discount. I had a thought the other day (and a good lie down after) that this whole charging at home (and from lamp posts etc. idiocy cos like that will ever happen) is a complete red herring. We don't fuel our cars at home (actually I live in a farming area but let's park that one) so why, especially in urban areas, would we need this just because the car is electric. The real issue is delivering a usable range (pick the number) which I shall say for the sake of argument is 200 miles that is achievable in 5 minutes of charge. Then build charging stations (convert petrol stations) and voila. And I think this will come - I'm convinced the speed of tech change will allow something along these lines very swiftly - until then electric cars are really not very democratic, if you can't afford a driveway you can't have the car? but once really fast charging is available for most peoples 1 week travel? Job done!"

The interior is a bit Lagonda and will age terribly though.. And replacing mirrors with cameras is such a form before function move....it puts me right off. Fair enough on a motorway cruiser, pointless on a 90 mile range city car. I quite like the interior materials though..But it's just too much money for something with such limited use. I don't think it's desirable or interesting enough to justify the price. Electric cars shouldn't still have this stupid premium. It's an 18 grand car without the batteries."

So it can be done can't it ? Think the range will kill it despite being super desirable. The lack of composure on B-roads realistically nobody buying it will give a toss. Nobody drives these things like magazine/journalists do anyways. But range ? People will compare it, and when alternatives are DOUBLE the range of this one.. why would you."

I don't post very often (to say the least  ) as you'll be able to tell from my stats <--This thread got me thinking though; it's a bit different to the usual lottery winning dreams... what 10 cars 'MUST' I own; realistically? The first 5 were easy, the next 5 required some thought and then I found it hard to stop! Anyway...1. DeLorean DMC-12, manual, black interior. Always wanted one; will have one as a keeper.2. Caterham 7, not a full-on hardcore model, maybe a Roadsport. Fulfilled a dream when I bought my Elise S1 and the Caterham would fill the void left when I traded it in.3. TVR Cerbera, for the noise.4. Ferrari of some description, budget permitting, something like a 360 Modena F1. Another keeper once I could afford one.5. BMW Z1. I can't explain it; just think they're cool. Although with a DeLorean on the list and considering I have an RX8 currently, maybe I have a thing for strange doors?6. Original Mini Cooper. Wanted one of these as a teenager, still do today.7. Porsche 944. Classic.8. Lotus Esprit. I fluctuate between the early ones and the end-of-the-line powerful ones.9. Honda NSX. Remember seeing my first one as a teenager and thought of getting one instead of the RX8.10. A modern Morgan, even though I'm not sure about the headlights.In an ideal world there would be more... E-type, XJ220, McLaren F1 etc but that's never going to happen (keeps fingers crossed for lotto win).My dream list changes almost daily and I'm off to Tanzania next week for a couple of weeks; bound to come back wanting a knackered old Land Cruiser!Thanks for reading.Edited by TitaniumTim on Thursday 2nd September 16:16"

Owned one (2007 4.3 coupe), loved it, but big bills at 30k to 40k miles: I spent a lot getting my fully histories, two owner car sorted over the 10,000 miles I had it, and stuff went wrong every month. Mostly consumables though, so if this car has had clutch, brakes and suspension done recently, OK. But absolutely every part on these cars costs an enormous amount - more than Ferraris for some stuff (£600 for a single coil spring, anyone?), as you will find on the numerous threads on these here. And specialists charge almost as much labour as dealers: floating around somewhere on the AM forum is my hilarious (think thousands) quote to get the brakes replaced. When you start replacing things like engine mounts and suspension arms, as you will on a high mileage car like this, have lots of cash ready for parts, and have a local garage do the work.And the electronics are made of chocolate. Woe betide you if you need to replace a module somewhere. I did, and I wept.I'd have a convertible 4.7 version again, though. I'm stupid like that. Gorgeous looks, noise and drive.

I remember thinking how cool the pop up sat nav looked at night! I wound down the window and gave the driver a massive grin and a big thumbs up and when the lights turned green he thanked me - what a sound, a sound that will stay with me for the rest of my life.

Mine was very low mileage, about 30k at the time, but I think I was the 7th owner (so it had had about 1 a year at the time). Servicing costs was not excessive and the only 2 non service items were new brake pads and a new rear bumper because the old one sort of had bowed somehow (you couldn't really see it unless you looked and the light caught it). Nothing went wrong with it for the time I had it.However, as much as a tried to like it, I never really got on with it. They do look fantastic (mine was black) but it lacks something - 2 turbos in my opinion ! So it went after 18 months. Maybe the V12 would have been better for me ? But I can't afford one of those.

They need to be used regularly but otherwise mine has been very reliable. Bamford Rose and other independents are fantastic with these cars. Driving mine takes a bit of effort (heavy clutch etc) but the noise, handling and confidence it inspires is fantastic. Buy on condition and history not mileage. Use it regularly, forget depreciation, keep it clean and serviced and you will enjoy every trip except being stuck in traffic. If you can get one with the lighter clutch then even better. People are interested in the car, not you! I happily let dads and lads sit in and rev the engine, it makes me happy that other people appreciate a nice car.

 As her mileage is so low, wouldn't a PHEV be a better option?It would always run on battery except for the once-a-year trip which would then not have any range/charging concerns.Not sure how it would compare price-wise: possibly cheaper? And more likely to be able to fit a tow-bar?While I see your point, her current car is now well over a decade old, so she keeps her cars long time. Regulations here (Benelux) have been cracking down on PHEV's year after year.Another point of consideration for her is that she can charge on a couple of locations on a weekly basis (not at home or at work), which she would utilize. A BEV with +150km range will allow her to bridge it for a couple of weeks, a PHEV with 30km would struggle.In the end she really wants a BEV and I can't blame her.But to follow on the PHEV path, are their any interesting small-ish PHEV's?Peugeot has a couple iirc?Sorry, can't help with that and her charging options would rule out the PHEV anyway, as you say. Plus it's just struck me that using a PHEV in battery-only mode for long periods may not be good for the reliability of the ICE."

I've driven a new Corsa which I understand is the same chassis beneath and it did have horrifically crashy suspension - hopefully the Peugeot is tuned differently! But otherwise really quiet and refined cabin. Only problem with Peugeot's is their obsession with forcing you to steer with a fat bottle cap which you must peer over as it obscures your view of the dials. This plagues / ruins all of their models, they'd be great cars otherwise."

They are the same car beneath the shell, it’s not the most economical EV and the range is not what they quote but I’m happy with it for the most part."

Really comfortable seats - in the front at least, quite sporty.  Stick it in sport mode, its nippy enough, handles okay - well, the steering is dead and inert like everything else, but you are low down and it does that magic EV trick of surprising you how well it goes around a roundabout.Downsides?Doesn't seem to have a real charging scheduler - all you can do is delay charging to a set time - then it charges to 100%.  The Zoe timer starts and stops, making it very compatible with cheap overnight tariffs.No heated seats optionWife prefers to be higher up - and therefore prefers the Zoe....Overall?

If the car is to become part of the trip, it has to have character - which means it needs to be more flawed than almost all the suggestions on here.I'm with these two. If your definition of the best road trip car is the best car in which to cover vast miles in comfort without feeling like you've gone through much hardship then the answer would be an S class Mercedes or similar. I'd rather do it in something daft, anything sporty would do, even if it is flawed. The three European road trips I've been on have been in a Mk2 Golf GTI, a Corrado and a rented Fiat 500. The Golf and the Corrado were very flawed machines for long distances, they weren't comfort orientated but the journeys were brilliant and the cars made it an event. The Fiat was much better at covering miles with little fuss but the journey was about the scenery along the way, the car was a bystander.If I was going on another I'd take my TVR if I could afford to feed it petrol or if I could choose something then probably something like a classic 911 or an oldish Ferrari, modern cars don't really do it for me."

 Few things here. RRS D300 is my own personal choice of family car, I'm not saying it's the best out there, I just like the look, I was keen to find a '23 model car (without the speed safety nonsense and still with manual heater controls and actual buttons) and have a good local dealer. The other issue today is if you're looking for a diesel in 2023/24, there's very little choice beyond LR product available today. Re being a farmer and making this a business purchase, that would be great if you could actually make a profit from farming! The farm struggles to make a profit most years, so the last thing I need is yet another cost to set against the farm's measly output. Pitching for a long-termer could have worked but they are generally only for 6 months and there's often compromises to consider. Mr Clarkson has never accepted a long-termer during his career in motor journalism, simply on principle and I have always admired that.Then the terms of my finance deals on my own personal cars will (and always will) remain private. I used the PCP deals taken from the LR website in this video as a simple way to show the differences in monthly cost between the various examples I used. There's no way I would ever choose a Disco 5 as it's as fugly as the X5 is and I wouldn't be seen dead in one! I hate them with a passion but have always admired the Disco 3 and 4 as being proper workhorses but, again, I've no desire to actually own one.Thanks, never thought the D5 was that bad!!"

There are a few factors that I feel people are running with that are overlooked. This is only for someone (like Harry) who is buying a brand new Range Rover and you live in da countryside. Yes I can agree with Harry he uses the RR for long journeys and that is also why I have my ye olde 2010 Q7 Tdi.You could also be doing the same man maths on a 2023 992 Turbo being over supplied or depreciating like a stone but that is another discussion but the same distorted platform of supply and demand being set by the supplier of the product in Britain, not the Government. Why didn't Harry test his own hybrid Range Rover knowing his own case use. The UK government specifically made an EV tax break and did not set a limit or cap on it. Many other countries have set a luxury tax upper limit so you don't get more off the more you spend. I also think Harry is distorting his own ownership as being your ownership, pointing to 12 sports cars in a shed as the antidote to speed as though this is the general public. Most people own 0.7-1.3 cars per household and most people don't drive as a hobby. I would also question the idea that these luxury EVs or a Hybrid are all lemons. All of the factors that Harry points out on the used EV market, over supply, dealers only wanting to sell new cars, not used ones means that a bargain can be had not because the car itself is poor."

 So choosing the lower number wasn't random? you implied the two car solution with your issue re towing. You've got to start thinking this stuff through at some point. You're approaching middle age and still making the same basic errors. Where did I imply purchasing two cars?Donkey, perhaps start by reading people's posts and stop compiling an MDAL against every single poster. It would make discussions a lot more straightforward. Add your last point to the list too.Or have a think about what you write, like genuinely think it through to the end. Need one car for towing.  Buy a car that cannot do those towing duties was your view.  Now, spend just a little bit of time thinking your point through.  That's right, there's that need to tow issue unresolved.  Come on. You must engage brain on this stuff before spouting.  Even the Jehovah's Witnesses plan their stuff and prepare before knocking on doors to suggest lifestyles that don't fit.  You spend most of your days driving up and down motorways so use some of that spare time to formulate so coherent thoughts or just looking around and attempting to come to terms with the world outside not being uniform or identical to your particular world."

LPG seems to be dying off. I can't plug in a car at home, so unless I move house anything I get will have to be ICE or a non plug in hybrid.The absence of private purchases of new EVs really is merely a function of pricing.  The used market shows where private individuals are willing to transact.  Used EV values are being defined by the private consumer and it's very refreshing to see.  But at the same time new prices keep being defined in the media and others by their RRP which is a wholly fabricated number, it's not a real 'price'. In the case of EVs the true 'price' is the net of BIK. So EV depreciation isn't actually as great as being made out.  It might be more accurate to contrast the 'monthly' between the two actually very disperate markets.  Conversely, we aren't being forced to buy EVs.  Manufacturers are being forced to sell them and now the ZEV Mandate is in place to ratchet that pressure up.  Manufacturers will have to do more and more to encourage consumers to choose EV over ICE.  They'll be doing snide things like trying to raise the price of ICE and backing ULEZ schemes but ultimately to reach the volume targets required they'll have to shift more and more generic, affordable utility boxes.  And we also have to be pragmatic. Car users without easy offstreet charging potential are of zero relevance between now and 2035.  They aren't the low hanging fruit over the next decade and no one cares whether they switch to EV or not.  The target market is the larger segment who do have easy home charging.  It's the largest segment, certainly among new and nearly new.  The third party infrastructure only needs to be expanded to cater for their needs.  You can't sell a product to people who either cannot afford it or who cannot use it.  Nearly 70% of U.K. households have private parking for at least one car.  Of the 30% that don't a reasonable number don't even own a car at all.  That 30% of households simply are not target customers and no one is interested in trying to sell to it as it's not remotely viable.  And that segment has an abundance of ICe choices to choose from.  Lord knows why Harry kept referring to the EV switch as a Revolution. It's no such thing and never has been.   The RRS diesel Harry has just bought will still be on the road in 2040 and being used by someone and it'll be someone for whom the use case and cost align to be the favourable means of transport. In short, don't have easy home charging then EVs aren't being aimed at you any more than new EVs are being aimed at people like me unable to take advantage of things like BIK etc.  Used EVs are what are being aimed at someone like me but that market is barely much more than a year or two old and while pricing looks OK I still need to decide whether used EV makes my life easier or better than used big cc ICE.  Which it doesn't, fundamentally for the same reasons as Harry.  Used shopping car however very massively does.  When the current shopping car I have finally needs replacing it will categorically be with an EV and that EV will simply be used until it becomes next to worthless."

Living in Canada in a downtown I have still not  bought an EV but have cars for towing and very long distances r driving abs so on.  The charging infrastructure is just not there when I set out on a multi thousand km trip.  I can find places on highway but adds huge time.Thus no long distance EV and not for towing. I use a Cayenne V8 for the latter.This leaves shopping and local city trips where performance and range are irrelevant. What matters in parkability and resistance to being left outside in very cold winters.I do have a driveway and can put in charging which solves the winter issue but the current range of EVs here consists of vehicles that are too big and too expensive.The solution for many years has been a Smart ForTwo diesel that never goes on highway and has done 21000 miles since I bought it in 2004. Not sure there is any “should” here.  I thought Harry made the case that worked for him personally, and in my case I will eventually get something like a Fiat 500e whenever the Smart dies.Edited by RDMcG on Sunday 11th February 14:38"

Saturday 27th November 2021,https://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&f=247&t=1961946,Charging - can someone explain it?,Won't work. The car needs to communicate with the charger before it will accept charge - there's a lot of electronics behind the female socket of a home charger to achieve that communication between car and charger. What you have linked to is just the socket component of what would become a charger.The 3 pin cable you already use has the same electronics in the 'brick' mid cable.You need a 7kw home charger installing. I'd do so sooner rather than later whilst grants remain. A 7kw charger will fully charge almost any EV overnight with ease.

Takes an age if you are sitting watching it (like a kettle) but plug in at night and set it to charge from midnight to 7am for the cheap rates and you'll get up to an extra 70 miles every day.We average a similar distance (30-50 miles) per day and it's not been an issue for us and our last 2 cars have been less efficient than the Fiat.

 2025 Porsche 718 Boxster EV  - Latest spy shots of the interior. The interior pics also reveal 252 kilometers of driving range, meaning 157 miles. The slightly curved line under the 252 on the digital instrument cluster indicates a nearly full battery..Doesn't look to me like the battery gauge is showing a full charge (not seeing a % doesn't help) based on the charge line design being symetrical (Germans like symmetry) I'd say the full range is closer to 300-350km, though that dash and charge graphics look different to the Taycan.All the photo shows is that the cars current charge has a range of 252km left, based on the driving style at the time."

May or may not still be the case, but introducing a sports car as EV only would be a ""courageous"" move, to borrow a euphemism from Yes, Minister. To repeat the Taycan experiment would be a clear demostration of learning difficulties. Not they are not great, but 2 very close colleagues have them, and it's a whole different new Porsche ownership experience to my own. Both are extremely happy to have them on reduced tax salary sacrifice leases, because the leasing company is almost definitely going to catch a cold when resale time comes. Whatever is in the range, I'll be really surprised if the electric version isn't the ""flagship"", with the highest performance."

The electric Cayman & Boxster are just a more concentrated 4 cylinder sized issue for them.I’m sure it will appeal to the many, just not any of the purists and long term owners. Also do they have a plan b for US sales, they seem less interested in electric cars and would want range as a buying point, if the US is an expanding sales market it would be suicide to go down an electric only model range."
Thursday 30th December 2021,https://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&f=247&t=1966990,Honda E?,I had my Personal independence payment increased to include the mobility component a few months back and I have thought here and there about exchanging my allowance for a Motability car but ultimately decided on the whole it was cheaper to keep and run my current privately owned car. I am about to have to embark on some expensive maintenance including a new timing chain etc so I've been thinking again about going with a Motability car.I can not believe that the Honda E (base model) is available with no advance payment and also you get help with having a home charger installed. For £76 or whatever a week I think that's an incredible deal but I've never owned or even driven an electric car. I like the Honda brand and I think the E looks good outside and inside.I don't do long journeys but I hear some reviews saying the range is very poor and the infotainment UI is bad. Wondering if anyone has experience with one and if it makes for a suitable first foray into electric vehicle ownership?

For no advance payment you can get the Honda E, MG ZS 45KW, Leaf 40KW, Mini Cooper S 33KW or Hyundai Kona 39KW. The MG name doesn't conjure up anything for me and I just see it as a Chinese electric car which I guess it is, the Hyundai Kona is very ugly. The Mini Cooper has a much more powerful motor and a few more miles range than the Honda E though. I think I'd probably have to try the E and the Mini before the others.

Whilst they were playing catch-up for ICE, they have been producing arguably superior vehicles in their own markets at higher volumes than anyone would do in the UK (or indeed Europe).Whilst the MGs are indeed rebadged Chinese vehicles (from SAIC, who make and sell millions of cars every year), they seem to know what they're doing with EVs.  Quite a few interesting 'Fully Charged' reviews seem to back that up.The other brands that aren't here yet are going to be very interesting.  The Ora Cat looks to be a good competitor in the Honda E space, and is coming to the UK next year, but I'm looking forward to seeing the likes of Xpeng bringing their models over (if they do).I can't help but feel like we, as consumers, are paying for the traditional fossil-fuel brands to evolve their technology, whereas that's not particularly the case with the ""new"" car companies that have set out to make EVs.  Granted there are various moral and social concerns around EVs, not lease the manufacturing of anything in China, but it will be competition that makes everything affordable for the masses."

There are Teslas made in China, alongside 29 other makers.  The reality is that companies who made the batteries, like BYD, have found it's rather simple to just make cars instead, when that's where a lot of the cost/profit/complexity is.The basic maths of it is that there are 1.4 billion people in China, which is double the total population of Europe currently.

The range issue isn't an issue at all so long as it's 'enough' anyway.You get about £62.50 or so a week for your mobility needs, so you can use it for public transport/taxis etc or you can forego the money and select a car instead. Some cars need an advance payment, say for example £1500 for a 1 series BMW but quite a lot of cars don't need any down payment. Any optional extras or paint finishes have to be paid upfront too. The main thing is that you really literally only need to add fuel, screenwash etc. Insurance, servicing, road fund license, breakdown cover and even tyres are all included. It's worth mentioning that Motability itself is a charity but the money for the cars comes from an individual's benefit entitlement. Considering disabled people used to have to drive those awful Tridents /plastic pigs, I think it's one thing successive governments can be proud of.Range really is not an issue for me, the longest journey I do is from Luton to Stevenage & back which is 30 miles all round. I could probably charge a Honda E once a week and be good for mileage. Seems the popular opinion thus far is that if the range isn't an issue then it's the one to have. I just watched some YouTube videos of that Mini Cooper hitting 60 in around 6 and a half seconds thoughI think the E is certainly the trendiest and funkiest of them all, and I know some don't like it but I think that interior is pretty sweet. Just hope the seats and my spine can manage to strike a deal"

I know the Honda E has fully independent suspension just like it was on my old Civic, I always found that to be a fantastic in terms of ride and handling. I don't like firm riding cars because 99% of the time my driving is purely for necessity, it's not worth a sporty suspension for that rarest of opportunities to enjoy driving.Can I ask how you found the lack of door mirrors? are the mirror screens an easy transition? I've seen reviews say the cameras repel rain well enough and the blind spot detection is good.I'm going to book s test drive in the new year but I'm glad I've asked for advice from PHers to rule out any immediate deal breakers.

The entertainment system is one of the best on the market, only rivalled by Volvo really. It fully supports Android Auto and Apple Carplay if you prefer to use those systems too.It's very easy to drive, especially in one pedal mode. It's easy to park, with an incredibly small turning circle. It's comfortable. I have some mobility issues and find it easy to get in and out of. The screens that replace the mirrors are very good, you need to turn your head less for the side ones. I find that a rear view mirror often needs to be adjusted as my body compresses a bit in the evenings, but with a digital one no adjustment is needed.The only issue you might have is no arm rest, but you can buy one as an extra and have the dealer fit it. Oh, and the boot is very small too, make sure your equipment fits in there (or use the back seats).As for range, 80 miles in all conditions, more like 100-110 in the summer. Obviously only you know if that is adequate for you. For longer trips you can of course charge it up in about 30 minutes on a rapid charger, which you can find at every motorway service station and many other places. The Zap Map website is good for checking chargers on the routes you frequently use, and A Better Route Planner will allow you to see how practical your journeys are.Personally I had a Nissan Leaf 24 and 30. The 30 has about the same range as the Honda E and it was fine for me. Even the 24 was no problem, in fact I loved that car."

The interior mirror I didn't like in video mode but it selectable as a conventional mirror.As other have said the weak point is the range, it was below 100 miles within minutes and its hard to get away from what seems to be a very rapid move  towards empty.   One general point to make is that the whole EV experience is very dependent on the app and software.  It has taken every manufacturer, including Tesla, a couple of years to work out how to do it and to educate the dealerships.  I would avoid owning the first EV from any manufacturer or dealer for at least two years unless you really enjoy the early adopter/beta tester experience."

Some of the features were gimmicky eg the video rear view mirror.   It drove perfectly well - the usual recipe of swift, silent and gregarious in a small EV. The collision avoidance stuff was awful and the main reason I sold it; driving in the cut and thrust of slow moving rush hour traffic, it would regularly insist you were about to crash, slam on the brakes and disable the controls for a few seconds - which felt very long when you were then stuck across a junction or roundabout.   Intrusive to the point of dangerous. In summary - just not as good a user experience as the faultless I3.

So that left me with a two seater sports car, a large dog and a partner who uses a wheelchair. I need a runabout till the Audi replacement arrived.I was looking at shed of the week type estates that used to be around the £1500 mark.....that were now £5000 or so given the sillyness of the used car market so on a whim I looked at cheap EV leases.After going to a broker and about 6 cars in asking about lead times and availablity we changed tack and asked the broker what was available in stock for immediate delivery. Mazda MX-30's was the answer, so having googled them and figuring out the range was around 100 miles which seemed to be putting off most people - we ordered two.As a daily driver, shopping car, dog car, town car, going to the gym car I just can't fault it. The dashboard bleeps at me a lot for reasons I'm not sure why as I've still not bothered to figure out how to turn it all on or off.The funky door designs are a revelation for disabled access. The front doors open 90 degress wide and provide huge access, the seat height is ""bum"" height so you just slide in and out. Very easy to use, nice specification as standard.Go and try one, it might be perfect for you. With the added bonus that there's likely to be stock you can have at short notice.I did check and at least one model is available on Motability with £0 down, the others are no more than £500 up front for extra bits, but if you ask me, the less alarms and assistance systems that you have the better.

She was then late for another arrangement and so left the car to sort itself out.The following day I discovered the problem and found that the drivers door would open from the outside, but the car was dead.I pulled out the thick drivers manual and couldn't find anything about a dead battery.I phoned the Kia dealer from whom we had bought the car and was told to charge the auxiliary battery ... I was also asked if the car had a ""re-start the battery"" switch ? If it has, I can't find it. So I opened the bonnet from inside the car and found that the auxiliary battery was reading 4v ... and I therefore put this on a 5amp charger. Some hours later I came back to the car ... it did appear to be charging, but the battery voltage was still around 5 volts, so I phoned the dealer and asked to speak to a technician. Apparently this was not possible and I was advised to arrange to have the car recovered ... which I guess could have been complicated since it was locked in Park and plugged into the main battery charger.I figured that either something had discharged the auxiliary battery (or this had failed) ... but why wouldn't it charge ? Maybe the charger was sensing a fault ? Or maybe there was a discharge equating to the charge current ? So I decided to remove the battery to charge it but at the sane time I decided to find, collect and fit a new replacement battery. There was one at dealership 20 miles away ...Once connected the car sprung back into life ... and incidentally the old battery still appears to be holding a good charge ... 12.7 volts as of  now and not touched since charged fully following the lock-out.So I tried to get in touch with Kia Customer Service asking to speak with a technician with whom I could share my experience. No interest, ""talk to your supplying dealer"" was the best they could muster. Then i receive a questionnaire asking about my experience with Kia Customer Care ... which I of course panned ... and following which I have heard nothing.Since this time amongst family and friends I have discovered two other Kia owners who have suffered similar problems being locked in or locked out.How will this problem ever be solved unless the manufacturer will communicate in order to analyse the issue and coordinate at least an action plan to deal with the immediate consequences and then an owner-fix which does not involve recovering the car at great expense, inconvenience and possibly collateral damage ?So, have you been locked in your Ev ?

 As others have pointed out, I don't really see why it would be anything to do with it being an EV. The doors work the same! In my TVR T350 it is possible to be locked in due to the contact points having rust or moved out of place due to flexing of the body. There is a button to open the door which triggers a motor to unlock. However, there is a manual cable which you can pull to open the door (it's an emergency cable because once used it takes a bit of fiddling to reset the cable).In my other cars it's always been a mechanical function. You pull the door handle lock and it opens the latch.I wouldn't know whether keyless entry cars would have the same issue as EV though."

I've had to jump 2 EVs (and a PHEV actually) because of dead 12v batteries. You need the juice to close the contactor.Looks like the reason you've got stuck is that the 12v battery had died. Surely this can only be because the battery is faulty, of the dc dc battery charger is dead.We had an eNiro die at work, probably because something was left on in the car. Battery was down at 7v. Jumped it and it started, then measured 14v on the battery, so it was charging. Is this the case in yours?I'd definitely be changing the battery. It's well within the realms of a DIY job."

And why wouldn't the battery charge on the car ? Which brought me back to the idea of some very heavy load that dropped the voltage so far and was taking the charge from the 5 amp charger ?Maybe disconnecting the battery completely to replace it was actually the cure in that it force-turned everything off ??Edited by ChrisW. on Saturday 5th August 12:30"

Is an MG4 a nicer thing to own/drive than a Sandero? Yes - at least by £75 a month in value terms. And whilst it's not part of my buying decision.. I suppose there should be some extra value attached in terms of it being better for the environment.The £75 'extra' is itself not really a true cost anyway as the car itself will remain of higher value than the Sandero at whatever point it's sold. Also cheaper servicing, zero road tax currently and soon likely to be still lower than ICE road tax, less brake wear.... Almost certainly less lifetime repair costs in most instances too.

And beyond political desire, it's perfectly normal as times and technologies change for the price of things to go up/down. Cars are taking a jump in cost, EV's more of a jump than ICE.I don't believe those that can only afford a very old EV with limited range will really need anything else as a necessity. So long as you can get to work, get the kids to school and reach the local hospital etc then that's the necessary job of a car done, and a 13 year old Nissan Leaf bought for cheaps will in all likelihood still be perfectly capable of that. Obviously it's 'nicer' if the car can do 200 miles on a charge and doesn't have worn out seats and shot dampers... But getting the nicer things in life does tend to come at a cost which will rapidly exceed the means of the lowest income households."

You could put the worlds most powerful electric motor in a car, and on a quiet run to the shops probably wouldn't be much less efficient than a very small one. I don't think the cost of building them would be much different either. Certainly not compared to the differences required in ICEBut between you and reality is a bunch of salespeople designed to function in the last century and buyers for that matter.They are selling a consumer product and they are pretty much telling the producers what performance figure to put on the packaging that will sell the product but not destroy the future sales of incrementally faster cars.There are currently massive downsides to electric cars, and the power figures need to balance that. Which is why to convince joe public to buy them they are all coming out a bit faster than the previous iteration of ICE, plus an extra power figure on top to make joe forget about the problems of charging, range anxiety and general blandness."

For my daily, I wouldn't give a st that it could do 5s to 60. What I do give a st about is that I could plug it in once a week and do a commute everyday.I guess they're trying to make EVs cool by being Porsche-beating (insert your own brand).I'd rather have an EV that did 8s to 60 but had a 1000 mile range. The range needs to be much bigger than a diesel to take into account the moronic time it takes to charge up even the best EV. 20 minutes is stupidly long. A boring diesel can get a 600 mile range in 5 minutes... including the time it takes to pay.Add the fact that it now costs the same to charge an EV in a public charging bay as it does a family hatchback or you have to put up with an 8 hour home charge overnight.

Especially in the early days of EVs when Teslas were marketing their cars. They had to have a selling point over ICE cars and acceleration was an easy selling point to make. Over in the states with lower gas prices, I guess there was less of a difference in cost per mile when comparing petrol and electric so I guess they went with acceleration as the main selling point.Carwow seem to just do drag races as filler between car reviews. I used to watch them but got tired of it after awhile. Now other manufacturers and review channels also give airtime to other more practical aspects of EV ownership which is probably more important to the general buying public."

A powerful electric car, therefore, doesn't lose range by virtue of simply being powerful with the corollary that a weedy electric car doesn't gain range simply by being weedy.  There isn't anything in particular to be gained by making electric cars less powerful, so companies generally don't.  A better motor might cost a grand or two more, per car, but that's not really a problem when consumers are prepared to pay that.  People will either want the additional performance or will be ambivalent to its presence.  A much harder sell would be a very slow electric car that doesn't go any further than a fast one and costs almost the same.  Vauxhall's appear to have had that problem with the electric hatchbacks."

The downsides of all that power are so minimal that you might as well 'let em ave it', for any drivers that happen to like it. for most drivers, it's just bloody useful to be able to dart rapidly into a gap on a busy roundabout etc.Bigger batteries equal more range. The size of the motors fitted only determine the speed at which that battery can be depleted. Drive a 500hp 2 tonne EV in the exact manner you would drive a 200hp 2 tonne EV, and the range will be about the same - allowing for aerodynamic and rolling resistance differences of course.There IS a weight and cost penalty when you get to a dual motor EV's, because you're dragging around the weight and cost of an extra motor. But such cars are performance models and are supposed to appeal in terms of speed and power. Even then, the actual range impact of the extra motor weight is very little if driven gently.

 There IS a weight and cost penalty when you get to a dual motor EV's, because you're dragging around the weight and cost of an extra motor. But such cars are performance models and are supposed to appeal in terms of speed and power. Even then, the actual range impact of the extra motor weight is very little if driven gently. IE a TM3 single motor might cost £6.5 to do 200 miles, a TM3LR dual motor might cost £7.50..Or to put it another way, you can increase the range by about 15% by avoiding the dual motor 4WD version. I'm fed up with reading ""the new fandangomobile has a skateboard battery, and the option of either one motor and 2WD or 2 motors and 4WD, with the top model having 500bhp and a 0-62 time of 3 seconds"". How much cheaper, lighter, more spacious and more economical would it be if it wasn't designed and developed to cope with the demands of the top model?"

 It's much, much easier to make a 1000hp EV than it is to make a 10 miles per kwh EV. With EV powertrain typically having over 85% efficiency, miles per kWh is dominated by vehicle losses.Aero drag is the big one. Significant improvement requires even lower drag coefficient, smaller frontal area and slower speeds. Or in other words, very slippery small cars going slowly. With these fundamental changes, 10 miles per kwh EV is definitely achievable. But you wouldn't like the product or using it. Better to go by train instead."

Extra weight and cost of the wheels, tyres and brakes is driven by requirements of high speed. Just limit top speed and all is cured."

How much cheaper, lighter, more spacious and more economical would it be if it wasn't designed and developed to cope with the demands of the top model?You're looking at this from an ICE point of view. You should ask questions and gain a better understanding ahead of deciding you're 'fed up' with something. I don't know why the power of a car you have would make you fed up anyway??There's nothing to be fed up about. Whatever EV you might buy, isn't going to cost you more because it's quite a bit nippier than the ICE equivalent. All EV's have invested more than enough in the suspension in order to handle the cars weight, the extra power doesn't add any additional burden - unless it's a performance orientated car, in which case of course you can pay more for a better setup.You don't need to upgrade the wheels or brakes (on an ICE you need to upgrade the brakes, but on an EV the brakes receive so much support via regen it's not required - unless the car is crazy fast or designed for track use). Tyres are normally the same across the range of power outputs for a model of EV, other than on the top models which sometimes have performance tyres - even then it's typically an option.If you buy a new EV and it has 250hp instead of the 160hp ICE equivalent, you really won't be paying a premium for that additional power, it's just a by-product of EV design."

Just the safety aspect of putting too much performance in the wrong hands.Has ever been thus.  There's not a suitability check when buying any car not matter what powers it. IME performance EV's are incredibly easy to drive slowly, far more so than ICE.  You just need some control over your right foot and a modicum of self control."

 Booked a Fiat 500e with Wiber in June, 2 days £30. Cheaper than a taxi.I ended up cancelling as OK did the same price but fully insured - there are lots of horror stories about Wiber from those who didn’t take insurance. I actually upgraded the Fiat to a Cupra Born as I needed longer range and more room (must be returned on 70% charge, something they don’t tell you until you get there).For most trips we’ve been using Record, they seem very efficient if you go for full insurance and fill your details in beforehand. It took 5 minutes to sort out collection which in Ibiza on a Saturday in July is pretty good going."
