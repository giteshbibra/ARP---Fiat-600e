We will receive our new fiat 500e icon 2 months ahead of schedule, so I'm not very prepared.  Will the car come with a charging cable?

Do I need a home EV charger or can it be plugged into an ordinary house socket?

If I do get an EV charger, which one should I get, there are so many out there?

I have ordered a fiat 500e icon on lease which will come in march, i had ordered a 208 gt premium petrol but they have had a recall on the car and delivery will be god knows when and i need to make sure i had a car for when my current lease went back end of march to start/mid april.

So i took the plunge as i wanted a EV (i do not drive far tbh) and this car was really the only one i could afford at the time i ordered it about a week ago.....other cars have prices raised ALOT and alot of cars and petrol ones have 8 weeks delivery some i have seen 6 months wait lol.

Anyway for the time being i will not be getting a home charger as the prices of them are ridiculous, i am sure they are charging way way over the odds for them, 700-1200. there have been a few for 549 etc but these are with the grant off WHICH if i tried to order now would be too late anyway as they do not have slots for instillation before the grant ends and so id be paying full price....literally can not afford it, plus i am pretty sure we would need something upgraded with the main fuse too.

I plan on using public chargers, there is a pub near me that has a free 50kw charger long as you are in the pub, me and my friend meet once a month for fee and usually in there atleast 3 hrs talking so it should give decent range, and there are others locally that you pay for but still cheaper than petrol.

i do not mind using a granny cable at home for inbetween tbh.

anyway the question is what cables come with the car, as in the description it just stays ....Charging Cable - Mode 3 

would that be the 7kw one where you can either plug it into a home wall charger and public chargers that are 7kw, do you get the granny cable at all as i do not fancy paying £170 for one.

many thanks"

I have bought a Fiat 500E Icon 2022 - it is also my first car.

I have a few questions:

How easy is it for a fiat 500E to get stolen? What things can I do so it makes it harder for anyone to steal? Do I need a Faraday pouch?

Secondly, if anyone has a baby/child, have you put a baby seat in the back and how has it been for you? (I'm thinking to have a baby in a few years and my HP will last for 3 years so there will be some overlap before I get a diff car so may need to put a baby seat in) 

I also don't have a drop kerb and with some manoeuvring I can use my neighbours drop kerb...how badly would the car suspension get damaged if i drive off without using my neighbours drop kerb?

Do you have any other general advice for first time car owners?

Thank you in advance"

I was wondering if anyone had any advice.  I collect my Fiat 500e this weekend, it comes with a free wall charger (The EasyWallBox be Engie).  However I am struggling to get anyone to Install it.

It can be plugged into a standard mains outlet for 2.3KW, or installed properly for 7KW.  It has a DPM sensor for monitoring the load on the main fuse.

Ive got a call with Western Power (I am in South Wales) to takes us off a loop and upgrade our fuse to 80A (From 63A), and so far I have had two installers say they cannot help as they are not 'accredited' for that charger.  I contacted Fiat and they said to contact Engie, Engie said they do not keep a list of installer and instead just sent me the Installation manual for installers.  All the other installers ive contacted have either not responded to their ""contact me"" form, or don't answer the phone

Has anyone had any luck getting this charger installed?

I appreciate that most people would just get a podpoint or something installed instead of the Fiat one if they had to buy one."

Watch the full length video to see the best places we visited on the beautiful islands: 

My verdict on the charging situation on the Orkney Islands: mediocre.
Especially when you compare it to the situation in Shetland where charging is much easier and more rapid chargers are well distributed.

In the Orkney Islands, however, you are better off taking the electric vehicle only on the Orkney mainland.
Stromness, Kirkwall, Finstown, St Margarets Hope and Dounby have some rapid chargers (and they work!). And a couple of 22kW chargers on the mainland.
However, the other islands have no chargers at all! Not even a slow charger...

Saying that, we took a day trip to Westray with a fully charged battery, which was not a problem thanks to the short distances on this island. I suppose you can do the same with the Isle of Hoy.

After all, we never had charging problems, never range anxiety, never an almost empty battery. So on the mainland it wasn't too bad if you get yourself organised and don't wait until the last minute/percentage to recharge.

Follow our road trip live. We travel until the end of September 2023:

Looks like I was the first to try it, as it only had 8 miles on the clock!

In general the car is a real quantum leap over the old 500. I always loved the look of the old 500, and actually bought one in 2009. However I sold it soon after as it was pretty crap to drive. This new electric model improves on the old car in pretty much every conceivable way.

Positives:

Looks great in the metal.
Finally a good driving position in a 500! Lots of adjustment in the seat and steering wheel. You can sit noticeably lower compared to the old 500.
The central display in the La Prima I drove was responsive and crisp, wireless CarPlay worked faultlessly.
Radar cruise and auto lane hold worked very well.
Performance felt decent. Nippy away from the lights.
Amazing turning circle!
I didn't have time to fully test the efficiency, but it seemed pretty good. Range was stated at 160 miles at 100% when I first got in, I drove for 13 miles at a stated 4 mi/kwh on a mixture of motorway and town driving and got back with 7% used and 147 miles left on the GOM. 

Negatives

Although the interior looks great, there are a few bits where the materials feel cheap.
The ride was generally good, but it tended to thump over serious bumps. Nowhere near as bad as the old 500 though.

Overall I really liked it! It's a pity I couldn't keep it for longer to really see what the efficiency is like and what it's like to live with. I'd also be interested to see what deals are available, at the right price it could be a really compelling package!"

(plus the recent charging situation for the Isle of Skye)

Part of my 143 day EV photo tour with the Fiat 500e was to the Isle of Lewis and Harris.
I've summarised my experience and advice on EV charging in the Outer Hebrides (plus a quick recap of the situation in Skye).

If you want to watch the video of this part of the tour, you can do this here:


Or you can read the blog:








						Photo Guide for Lewis and Harris, Outer Hebrides, Scotland
					

Both Lewis and Harris, part of the Outer Hebrides, make a great road trip for your EV and are particularly fascinating to see through a camera lens! If you want to find the best photo spots on Lewis and Harris, look no further - I've listed them all for you! From sea stacks to historical sites...

With photos of chargers etc.

Charging your electric vehicle is not always easy in the Outer Hebrides. There are only two rapid charging stations in Lewis and Harris (50kW), one in Lewis (Stornoway) and one in Harris (Tarbert). At Stornoway we faced hour-long queues, especially when a ferry arrived. We have often decided that it makes more sense to charge on a slower 22kW charger but use the charging time to eat or do something else.

In Tarbert it was a bit easier. When we were on the island (July 2023) charging was still free, but we were already seeing a new charging point that was about to go live. And once that's online, it won't be free anymore.

There are a few 22kW chargers across the island. If you drive a lot, I would recommend planning your charging stops accordingly.

Some are located next to the village cafe and I think it's only fair to contribute to the community by enjoying a cup of coffee or tea or even by having lunch there while charging.

For example, we did that at the Uig community center which is great when you want to go to the Mangersta Stacks.
And in Breaclete, which is very convenient to visit Great Bernera with your electric vehicle.

If you want to see North Lewis there is a charging station near Eoropie Beach which is great for visiting the beach but also Butt of Lewis, Port Stoth etc. However, nothing to do at this charging station, it is located on school grounds (albeit open to the public), so waiting for the car to charge at 22kW is no fun.

Luckily our Fiat 500e only takes 2 to 2.5 hours (on the fastest charge setting) from empty to 100% and we usually stop when it's at 40% and we know we won't have a rapid charger. In 1 to 1.5 hours we're done with a full charge and usually combine this with a packed lunch (picnic tables are all over the island).

But I know some cars don't pick up the juice that quickly and I've heard of some Zoe drivers taking two hours to charge 20% at those charge points - that sucks!

In Harris there is a 22 kW charger down South in Leverburgh, next to the ferry terminal.
But to be fair - the distances in Harris are so short and sooner or later you will be back in Tarbert with two 22kW chargers and one rapid charger, which will suffice.

One piece of urgent advice: check the ChargePlaceScotland app regularly to make sure the charging point you are trying to charge to is working! They seem to go out of service on a regular basis and it's no fun being stuck in a remote location with no e-juice and no alternative charging point!

Don't forget your CPS RFID card, the old charging stations don't accept charging via app (if you have mobile phone reception anyway...).

Another tip, if you are catching the ferry from Tabert to Uig on the Isle of Skye on the way back, make sure you fully charge your car in Tabert - the charging situation in Skye is dire, when we were there there was NONE RAPID CHARGER at all and only one 22kW charger with one socket in Portree.
The nearest charging points are all near the Skye Bridge as you exit the island.

All other EV chargers are out of order and we have met some EV drivers who have cancelled their stay in Skye and turned around due to the poor charging situation.
Skye got a really bad reputation for that, and while people usually love Skye, mass tourism, inflated prices and the lack of working charging points seem to be changing that at the moment.

It almost seems like a method of trying to get rid of EV drivers. Is this a way to reduce overtourism?!?

So charge to 100% in Tarbert or you won't be able to drive through Skye to get home!!!"

Bit confused about charging.

Should I always charge to about 80% and maybe once a month charge to 100% to balance the battery, is this necessary.

Also, I intend to drive in range mode but I've heard it's best to drive in normal mode every so often to help the brakes.

I have had my Nissan leaf since 2016 (type 1 charger) from new and had a pod point installed at home when I got the car.  

I'm getting a fiat 500e in a couple of weeks which obviously is type 2.

I've been in touch with pod point who have told me the tethered cable at home can't be swapped over due to new regulations and I need a whole new unit with a data cable.  The installation is not straightforward (but can be done as I already have a pod point)

A few questions

Is it illegal to still have a very old pod point {about 7 and half years old) which doesn't have the data cable.  I'm not bothered about viewing it all on my phone.

Can I just buy a type 1 to type 2 adapter and put this on the end of my tethered pod point cable at home.

Will this be detrimental to my new car in anyway.

I'm probably going to have to pay anything up to £1500 because the installation isn't straight forward.

Not sure whether it's just best to get a whole new unit installed with the data cable or stick with what I've got and buy an adapter???  This would save a lot of money.

Any advice welcome, thanks"

First time poster and EV owner here. My better half has just gotten her license (auto only) and decided to opt for the Fiat 500e 24kW.

We currently rent our home and may be looking to move in the next year or so. Ideally, we’d like a home charging solution since the range on the 24kW 500e isn’t the greatest and I don’t want to be sat in our local station car park every day!

Having a gander online I can see things like PodPoint’s are around £700 but with the £350 grant this will obviously work out cheaper. However, I’m reluctant to pay for a charger that I’ll own and add value to a house that’s not “mine”, only to move in 8 months time and have to fork out for a new charger again, this time without the grant (since it’ll have been used).

So, I know that Egg isn’t the cheapest solution as it’s £30 a month not including the exorbitant cost of electricity at the moment and I understand owning our charger would be a cheaper option long term BUT given our current circumstances described above, does this seem like a decent short term option or is there something better I should be looking at?

Apologies if this is a noob question, this is our first foray into EV’s and so I’d rather ask people with knowledge than try to figure it all out on my own with no idea what I’m doing.

Long version

Contemplating the future of my e208, I had a shock when I checked how much it would cost to insure a new driver using a comparison website (figures below for newly qualified driver in middle of suburbia nowhere special, clean license, 8000 miles driving per year). Unlike most of my previous small cars, I won't be selling it or donating it to someone looking for a cheap first car.



AgeCheapest quoteSecond cheapest quote17£3500£725021£2800£300025£2100£2200

(ps, I know these figures can be reduced a bit by various hacks such as having an older named driver on the policy).

But the 208 is insurance group 26. Figures for the Seat MII (insurance group 12) are more reasonable, and it's got a useable range. Unfortunately VW group are no longer making these small EVs so will soon become rare, and the lowest insurance group I could find for a new car with a reasonable range was group 17 for a Fiat 500e 42kWh. Nice looking car, but insurance might still be too pricey I suspect.

My questions are:
1) Are there any new cars coming soon with a reasonable range (eg 100 miles + winter range) and reasonable insurance (eg group 10ish or below)?
2) (not completely serious, but intended to promote discussion...) If someone invented a 'Stellantis Sport Mode disabler', could we get the e208/Corsa-E etc more sensible insurance quotes for its natural second and third hand market?"

I'm Änder from Luxembourg, aged 44 and last week I ordered a Fiat 500e Cabrio after having felt to get an electric car for a certain time now. The Fiat will be my main car, replacing my 2015 Renault Mégane Coupé-Cabriolet with a Diesel engine and more than 100k km on the counter.

I like to go on hikes in my country, especially the Auto-Pédestres. Their name comes from driving with a car to the starting point and then walking marked circuits, there are about 200 of those in my tiny country.
Seeing whole forest parcels dying these last years, I thought I better switch from burning oil products to electric power, which can be produced in a much cleaner way after all.

I hope I'll find the answers I'm looking for here and maybe make some interesting contacts."

Looking at the website you get a wall box that is essentially a neater way to use a 3 pin plug ( not bad but not ideal) as our dumb Rolec charger is nearly 6 years old I'm thinking of upgrading however there isn't any costs cited and dealership doesn't have details. 

Has anyone enquired? I know 6 years ago my install cost me £249 after the grant. I assume it'll be far more today. Also my concern is whilst 'smart' is neat. Dumb also means the energy providers can't tax use (which Im assuming will be enviable) as it's invisible to them so reluctant to give the Rolec up.

Been looking purely on a simple criteria.

1. Range must be 150 miles+  real world
2. Cheapest insurance
3. Purchase price under £20k for mileage under 30k miles.
4. Must have at least 50kw Rapid charging specced.
5. 7kw AC charging but 3.5kw might do.

Considerations so far.

VW E-UP  37kwh
SEAT Mii - 37 kwh
Skoda Citgo - 37 kwh
Fiat 500E - 42kwh
Peugeot E-208 - 50kwh

Rejected so far to expensive on insurance

Nissan Leaf 40kw
BMW i3 - 33kwh
Corsa-E  50kwh
Any Renault Zoe 40-50kwh
Mini Cooper S 33kwh

For owners of old petrol/diesels that do high mileage, there is definitely a benefit in switching - and leasing costs + running costs of a new EV can be less overall, eg for someone that dives in excess of 10k miles per year there are a few smaller EVs (VW eUP, Nissan Leaf, Fiat 500e, Renault Zoe, MG5) that can be leased for around the £250pcm mark, but deposits required are still hefty (£1k-£2k). 

But.... Many people buy older used cars, often for a few thousand / few hundred pounds. 

What brand out there could segway into a cheap, popular EV? 

Easyjet? MegaBus(BEV)? Aldi? 

Given the huge interest and limited supply of electric cars, it will be many, many years before we get to address this used EV & affordability issue. Maybe decades."

So I have a Kona and love it, the other half loves driving the Kona because of the electric, but doesn’t want one as it’s to big 😅 we were considering a Zoe (she has a Mazda 2 at the moment) but really like the style and quirkyness of the Fiat 500e!

It’ll be a 2nd car so it’s not doing long journeys, but what’s the backseats like for kids? YouTube reviews seem a bit mixed with some people saying it’s fine and others not. We have a 5 year old (in a high back booster) and a 12 year old, but realistically 90% of the time the 12 year old would be in the passenger seat and just the 5 year old in the back (there might be the rare occasion where one of them has a friend in the car as well but that’s a really specific circumstance not the norm). If it was all 4 of us we’d be using my Kona, but for when the other half is doing school runs and the odd trip to town etc, what’s peoples thoughts on the 500e? Anyone here have kids and use the back seats? How do they find it

I do totally understand, the Zoe is going to be more practical… but the 500e is a characterful little car!

Thanks!"

But Tesla is not the only name in town. Since most EVs have Level 1 (adaptive cruise control), I will just attempt to list the ones that have Level 2. No one in Europe (or the world for that matter, sans Japan) sells a Level 3 and above cars.

Level 2 (Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Centering), incomplete list:

Audi E-tron
Ford Mustang Mach-e (hands free)
Fiat 500e La Prima
Honda E
Hyundai Ioniq
Hyundai Ioniq 5 (hands free, lane change assist)
Hyundai Kona
Jaguar I-Pace 
Kia Niro EV (higher trims have even more autonomous features)
Mazda CX-30
MG MG5 LR
Nissan Leaf (called ProPilot)
Porsche Taycan
Tesla: all Tesla models are legally Level 2
VW Id3, Id4
How well these autonomous features work in practice varies a lot. Jerkiness in steering and braking under ACC are very common problems. Also L2 in heavy rain/snow are pretty much unsolved.

Now for pure speculation on the current major players, 100% my opinion:

Argo AI: This company has backing from both VW and Ford (each has 40% share) and it is already running a level 4 Fleet, and will soon be charging money for their Robo taxi service. VW also wants to sell this self driving as a service.
Aptiv aka Hyundai aka Motional: They're still betting on Robo taxi but undoubtedly the tech will drip down to your Ioniq/EV6 eventually.
Toyota: I'm still disappointed about Toyota's bet on Hydrogen, which could turn out to be another environmental disaster. But they've been investing heavily in self driving tech, and have announce significant spending in EVs. They recently bought out Level 5 (used to belong to Lyft and have a very significant UK presence)
Tesla: The elephant in the room, with the most publicity. They also have the most number of high profile crashes. But thousands of drivers swear by it.
There are of course many other ventures not listed here (Waymo for example but they don't sell cars, they sell a service). If want a car with good autonomous assist in the near future that's not a Tesla, my bet will be on ArgoAI's ventures aka Ford/VW. The technology seems most matured and both companies are committed to EV (for the VW case it's a matter of survival)."

I've been in touch with Hyundai and Kia dealerships and done quite a bit of research on these vehicles, but am struggling to really differentiate these cars from one another.

The 2019 Kia Niro EV is expected to be delivered to select Texas Kia dealerships in early 2019, as per my conversations with several dealerships. The 2019 Hyundai Kona EV, on the other hand, was not going to show up in Texas at all...and multiple dealerships had told me that I would not even be able to order one to be delivered, so I figured my decision was made for me.

BUT THEN

I saw this article: Hyundai Will Satisfy U.S. Hunger For Kona Electric that says that, although California and other ZEV states will be the only states that receive deliveries of the car, Hyundai will ship the 2019 Kona EV to dealers in non-ZEV states if there is a ""sold order"" in place.

So it looks like I have a choice again. I'm ultimately planning on test-driving both vehicles (out of town weddings are a good a time for a test-drive as any, right?), but wanted to see if there was anything else any of you had heard, seen, read, experienced that would lead you to recommend one vehicle over the other?

I've been in touch with Hyundai and Kia dealerships and done quite a bit of research on these vehicles, but am struggling to really differentiate these cars from one another.

The 2019 Kia Niro EV is expected to be delivered to select Texas Kia dealerships in early 2019, as per my conversations with several dealerships. The 2019 Hyundai Kona EV, on the other hand, was not going to show up in Texas at all...and multiple dealerships had told me that I would not even be able to order one to be delivered, so I figured my decision was made for me.

BUT THEN

I saw this article: Hyundai Will Satisfy U.S. Hunger For Kona Electric that says that, although California and other ZEV states will be the only states that receive deliveries of the car, Hyundai will ship the 2019 Kona EV to dealers in non-ZEV states if there is a ""sold order"" in place.

So it looks like I have a choice again. I'm ultimately planning on test-driving both vehicles (out of town weddings are a good a time for a test-drive as any, right?), but wanted to see if there was anything else any of you had heard, seen, read, experienced that would lead you to recommend one vehicle over the other?

Thanks in advance, appreciate the help!"

I am the very happy owner of a zippy Fiat 500e, my first EV, wonderful to commute and drop the kids off at school 5 min away.

I settled on keeping my good old and reliable ICE Dodge minivan to pull our motorcycle trailer for week end outings. It really is oversized for this usage and I was thinking of replacing it with a RAV4 EV with a hitch.

But... range and range reduction with the additional constraint of the (relatively light) trailer with 3 dirt bikes on it. I would be lucky to get a total of 60 real miles (guestimate) total for the full equipage, which really puts us right under what is needed to go to the nearest track and back...

But, pulling a trailer means that I can add things onto it, like... extra batteries for the Rav4 EV and may be get to a point where, even with the extra weight, I could extend the range sufficienty for our escapades.

Before getting into efficient frontier calculations (I wil need to research the data first), I wonder if anyone here has experience with adding extra batteries to their EV.  

Looking forward to learning.

Thank you,
E"

Having spent far too many hours of my life sprinting down country lanes and nipping across roundabouts I have to wonder...

Where's our hot hatch battery electric vehicle?

Surely this could/should/would be one of the key ice-breakers in terms of EV adoption.  Get people in a small(ish) EV with good performance and decent range... but most importantly compact and quick, and I'm sure you'll win ever more hearts and minds.

Am I mad in thinking this is a market that could really, really benefit from BEVs?  I mean they already claim them as city cars, the hot hatch is only one step beyond that surely?"

I already have an 2021 Audi ETron and a 2022 Chevy Bolt EUV that the kid is driving, and I’m looking for a third cheap used EV as a spare car. I initially made a large list that included the i3, Soul EV, Leaf, Fiat, but after driving them all I’ve narrowed it down to a 2017 Mercedes b250e and, because I like the Bolt EUV so much, a 2017-2018 Bolt EV Premier. Both have pros and cons. I don’t care that the Merc only has an 87-mile range, as it will only be used for errands around town so the extra range of the Bolt is not meaningful to me. Obviously, the interior and the ride quality of the Merc is way better than the Bolt, but the Merc will be more difficult and costly to repair as time goes on due to the fact that it was a limited specialty vehicle. I don’t even think that all Mercedes-Benz dealers can service a b250e, even here in Southern California. The Bolt would be much easier to maintain, and I actually like the exterior look of the Bolts more than the boring Mercedes. The Merc has better tech than the Bolt. Lastly, Mercedes can be had for a few thousand dollars less than the Bolt EV….here in SoCal used EV prices are still inflated.

Question is as per the subject - which of the popular EVs at the moment has what they call ""one pedal driving"" - from what I gather this means that you can set the regenerative braking to such a level that the car will completely stop on its own if you are driving smoothly and anticipating the stopping distances correctly?

Also - does this mean the brake lights come on automatically when you have this enabled as soon as you take your foot off the accelerator?"

A family member might want to buy my low mileage 2015 Dacia Duster diesel car, so I'm seriously pondering what to get now. Whilst I love my gadgets I also dig functionality over style, so what some might see as an ugly duckling, is not necessarily ruled out.

If I kept the diesel as a second vehicle I've been seriously tempted by the Twizy as a fun run around but if I'm selling the diesel, I'll need a far more capable vehicle. My only issue is my driveway is barely the length of a car, there's no gate and it's a busy main road (Southampton's very own Piccadilly Circus), where school children walk past every day. This means any car parked on the driveway needs to be reversed on as reversing out into a busy road is a no-go. This also means any electric car cannot have a charge port on the nose, as the darling little feral, pint sized crotch goblins will snap the plug and charge flap whilst walking by, the moment I turn my back!

So, I'm needing a short list of EVs which have side accessed charging ports. Budget £15-30k ish. Not that interested in PCP or finance unless I can get a discount then pay it off in full soon after, as I usually own a vehicle until it becomes a liability to keep repaired. New or nearly new / ex demo etc. The ones I can think of right now are:


Peugeot e208
Peugeot e2008
Vauxhall Corsa -e
Vauxhall Mokka -e
Citroen E-C4
Citroen Berlingo Electric
Mini Electric (bit small but it is cute)
BMW i3 (do like the styling, but worried BMW aftersales will be costly and painful)
VW ID.3 (do I really want to be a software beta tester for what might be Windows ME on Wheels??)
VW eUP and the VAG siblings (bit small, only 3kw charging on AC I seem to recall)
Skoda Enyaq
Smart For-Two / For-Four (excluded as they don't do DC rapid charge)

Tesla, even 2nd hand sub 30k, are off my shortlist as I can't be doing with a company who are so anti right-to-repair and have questionable build quality.

So, what cars have I missed, if any?"

So I have a Kona and love it, the other half loves driving the Kona because of the electric, but doesn’t want one as it’s to big 😅 we were considering a Zoe (she has a Mazda 2 at the moment) but really like the style and quirkyness of the Fiat 500e!

It’ll be a 2nd car so it’s not doing long journeys, but what’s the backseats like for kids? YouTube reviews seem a bit mixed with some people saying it’s fine and others not. We have a 5 year old (in a high back booster) and a 12 year old, but realistically 90% of the time the 12 year old would be in the passenger seat and just the 5 year old in the back (there might be the rare occasion where one of them has a friend in the car as well but that’s a really specific circumstance not the norm). If it was all 4 of us we’d be using my Kona, but for when the other half is doing school runs and the odd trip to town etc, what’s peoples thoughts on the 500e? Anyone here have kids and use the back seats? How do they find it

I do totally understand, the Zoe is going to be more practical… but the 500e is a characterful little car!

This is VERY MUCH in the line of thinking of the EVangelists.

i probably wouldn't get a leaf. Winter range is poor and it's chademo and the charge speed is poor. Build quality is better but the infotainment etc and interior is like a museum. Also they don't have steering wheel reach adjust until late 2020 so earlier ones can be uncomfortable.

Corsa is ok but let down by poor software and often useless dealers. Still miss the headlights as they are excellent. It is fun to drive too.  I checked my old one  and it's showing a recall so that's at least the second it's had in only 2 years. Outside warranty I think it could be bothersome as too many owners seem to have had problems.

Zoe ZE50 is more efficient but has poor NCAP safety. I'd check out its failings. if it's just rear passengers and you don't have them then it won't matter. I'd try one. Certain ones have the 5 year warranty not the lesser one. They're a safer buy. There's been some silly cheap ones about."

Long version

Contemplating the future of my e208, I had a shock when I checked how much it would cost to insure a new driver using a comparison website (figures below for newly qualified driver in middle of suburbia nowhere special, clean license, 8000 miles driving per year). Unlike most of my previous small cars, I won't be selling it or donating it to someone looking for a cheap first car.



AgeCheapest quoteSecond cheapest quote17£3500£725021£2800£300025£2100£2200

(ps, I know these figures can be reduced a bit by various hacks such as having an older named driver on the policy).

But the 208 is insurance group 26. Figures for the Seat MII (insurance group 12) are more reasonable, and it's got a useable range. Unfortunately VW group are no longer making these small EVs so will soon become rare, and the lowest insurance group I could find for a new car with a reasonable range was group 17 for a Fiat 500e 42kWh. Nice looking car, but insurance might still be too pricey I suspect.

My questions are:
1) Are there any new cars coming soon with a reasonable range (eg 100 miles + winter range) and reasonable insurance (eg group 10ish or below)?
2) (not completely serious, but intended to promote discussion...) If someone invented a 'Stellantis Sport Mode disabler', could we get the e208/Corsa-E etc more sensible insurance quotes for its natural second and third hand market?"

Unless you consider the Fiat 500e C. I would expect that it would be in the same segment for the target audience looking for a small design based convertible.

But, the cost difference (and real life range) is huge, you can pick up a brand new 500e C for about £29K and most people will easily get 160+ miles of range from it, whilst you will struggle to get more than 110 miles from the Mini e convertible.

            Yes something's have gone up more than inflation but many things have gone down.

The big things like housing, average house price in 2010 £178k and now £264k spot on with inflation. Ford Fiesta Titanium in 2010 £15k and £22k when it was discontinued again spot on with BOE inflation.

Other items, 2010 Samsung 40"" FHD TV £699 today £219. Most electronics have reduced in price like for like and are generally better spec and lower power consumption. But people want a 65"" OLED TV. Lifestyle creep.

Other things that people buy without thinking. You weren't popping via the Costa Drive-thru in 2010 because the first one didn't arrive until 2011. Part of lifestyle creep.

But there are definitely things that consistently outpace inflation like council tax which you can't do anything about.

People want better things I get that but many people feel worse off now because they aren't looking like for like.

You are missing the tax burden increasing which squeezes real take home pay. 
And then there also student loans adding a significant cost for many who effectively pay a higher rate of tax than the rest of us and again the threshold is frozen so even if they get inflation level pay rises they take home less in real terms. 

The big issue now is housing costs which have escalated significantly for those who cannot afford to buy as well as mortgage costs. You have a number for housing there but the data we see most often shows the multiple of earnings required to buy and it’s got a lot higher. That’s caused a rental crisis for many."

I’ve got to admit I have a lot of sympathy for them. They have spent a lot of money committing to electrification and the U.K. government keeps moving the goal posts around. Now they are going to be fined for not hitting sales quotas that are probably impossible to meet.

Net zero and EV adoption seems to have become a polarised political issue and instead of worrying about what state we leave the world in for future generations (Read the Reform flyer that comes through your letter box)  it’s much better to blame high energy prices on new technologies in response to abject nonsense from our highly informed press and social media outlets.

Given the onslaught of nonsense I don’t know what the solution is (as anything will be made out as an attack on normal folk). I don’t think it should a stick and I’m not sure about state sponsored tax dodging either. But the incoming changes to ULEZ seem bonkers to me. As does making VED the same as for petrol and diesel.

We have a green strip on our number plates, give them some perks, like access to bus lanes and free council parking. Maybe apply some sort of cap to fast charging prices. Run some public information campaigns about EV’s.

Post some ideas, mine might be stupid but perhaps there might be some good ones that an MP might see and something happen; rather than car manufacturers needing to be propped up with tax money to stay."

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years.

One of the challenges is that there is so much more choice now; Mini, ORA Cat and 500e are obvious choices and they can all go further for the odd journey if you wish.

We are thinking about having a fun small EV for mainly city use and I would really like a Honda e. But we had a 500e for two weeks in the coldest week in the winter and still managed to get over 120 miles on the motorway. Whilst it is rare we would want to do that, the peace of mind which comes with it is valuable."

            I'm not sure what to make of this thread - I buy an I-Pace, learn that JH has got one, and immediately feel that I've put my money into the right car, and then JH comes back to the forum and says he wants out of his !! Is it because I've got one ?

Personally, I've only had ""outside"" interest in two cars I've owned - the Ampera, and the I-Pace - the former getting the ""what the hell is that"" looks, the latter causing men to stop and drool as they walk past the huge 22"" wheels, the black ""Jaguar"" badges and tell their equally excited wives - ""look, it's a Jaguar"". No way would I give this up for anything even remotely normal - and any car that a YT, anti-EVer leases and moans about wouldn't hold any interest for me either.

and last but not least, are you really willing to lose £50K on the Jag, to throw another £50K away on another new EV that could get on the same price crash ladder ?

I’ve had two, still got the second till Oct when it goes back,  would happily have another.. it’s a brilliant car. There are some issues eg very slow DC charging by today’s standards, infotainment software issues, efficiency not brilliant. But that said, a very hard act to follow."

I have ordered a fiat 500e icon on lease which will come in march, i had ordered a 208 gt premium petrol but they have had a recall on the car and delivery will be god knows when and i need to make sure i had a car for when my current lease went back end of march to start/mid april.

So i took the plunge as i wanted a EV (i do not drive far tbh) and this car was really the only one i could afford at the time i ordered it about a week ago.....other cars have prices raised ALOT and alot of cars and petrol ones have 8 weeks delivery some i have seen 6 months wait lol.

Anyway for the time being i will not be getting a home charger as the prices of them are ridiculous, i am sure they are charging way way over the odds for them, 700-1200. there have been a few for 549 etc but these are with the grant off WHICH if i tried to order now would be too late anyway as they do not have slots for instillation before the grant ends and so id be paying full price....literally can not afford it, plus i am pretty sure we would need something upgraded with the main fuse too.

I plan on using public chargers, there is a pub near me that has a free 50kw charger long as you are in the pub, me and my friend meet once a month for fee and usually in there atleast 3 hrs talking so it should give decent range, and there are others locally that you pay for but still cheaper than petrol.

i do not mind using a granny cable at home for inbetween tbh.

anyway the question is what cables come with the car, as in the description it just stays ....Charging Cable - Mode 3 

would that be the 7kw one where you can either plug it into a home wall charger and public chargers that are 7kw, do you get the granny cable at all as i do not fancy paying £170 for one.

many thanks"

It can be plugged into a standard mains outlet for 2.3KW, or installed properly for 7KW.  It has a DPM sensor for monitoring the load on the main fuse.

Ive got a call with Western Power (I am in South Wales) to takes us off a loop and upgrade our fuse to 80A (From 63A), and so far I have had two installers say they cannot help as they are not 'accredited' for that charger.  I contacted Fiat and they said to contact Engie, Engie said they do not keep a list of installer and instead just sent me the Installation manual for installers.  All the other installers ive contacted have either not responded to their ""contact me"" form, or don't answer the phone

Has anyone had any luck getting this charger installed?

I appreciate that most people would just get a podpoint or something installed instead of the Fiat one if they had to buy one."

Owners of the most polluting cars can expect to pay more than twice as much as cleaner cars. There are now 26 different charges to park for an hour in Lambeth, depending on a car’s tax band and whether there is a diesel surcharge. The cost of a parking bay near Waterloo station in south London now ranges between £6.30 and £13.23 an hour, with payment made by an app.

For the last few years we've adopted a x1 ICE and x1 BEV vehicle strategy. We now use the ICE (VW campervan) for longer trips, weekends away etc, and the BEV (Tesla Model 3 initially then most recently a Model Y) for most day to day and local driving, which accounts for 80% of our driving. We did use the Tesla for longer journeys (south Wales to Scotland or France as examples) but more recently have found charging wait times and subsequent longer journey times to be a regular annoyance. Hence why we default, for now, to the ICE for longer trips. That should be better in a few years when the charging infrastructure has caught up.

We concluded last week that as a result we didn't need a Tesla to cover mostly local day to day driving for the next few years. So, on something of an impulse, we decided to swap it for a smaller, less expensive BEV with lower range. The e-208 won, picked one up a few days ago. £24k for a e-208 GT in Elixir Red. Registered Jan 2023 and with only 300 miles on the clock. So, basically a new car for a considerable discount off list. Further research tells me this is one of those 2022 models (range 225 miles) being cleared before the arrival of the refreshed version with slightly more power/range. Suits us perfectly though.

First impressions are very positive indeed!

Things I like more than the Tesla experience:

The e-208 looks lovely, nicely designed inside and out.
The drive in the e-208 is more refined. Much better suspension. And quieter.
More comfortable seats.
Apple Carplay is available.
Digital cockpit - good to have dials in front of me again.
Some buttons for simple controls.
Auto wipers work.
Door handles (inside and out) that I don't have to explain to people how they work.
A glovebox I can open without navigating a touchscreen (OK the glovebox is tiny )
Being back in a small hatchback is nice, much more town and car park friendly.
Insurance is less than half the price of insuring the Tesla

A few things that the Tesla wins on:

Range, obviously, it was a Model Y Long Range that could comfortably do 250 miles.
Ability to set a maximum state of charge, I used to set the Tesla at 80% max when charging overnight. Quite surprised I can't do that on the Peugeot.
Speed. Even the LR has ridiculous acceleration. I'm no boy racer though so can take it or leave it.
App just worked. Less steps to get it connected to the car and just leave it. Mobile as car key also good.
Heated seats. Didn't get them on the e-208, I gather they are an additional option.
Dog mode in the Tesla was regularly used.
Storage space, Model Y is obviously much bigger. But the e-208 boot is big enough for our spaniel so fine.
Frunk to carry charging cables

Overall, very happy with the change, always had a liking for little French hatchbacks and the e-208 seems a very good example of exactly that. It really is good to drive and pretty quick too."

Just got a new job which will involve 3 x 40 mile commutes per week so looking at an EV as I don't fancy putting the miles on (or spending that much time in) my Clio 200 track toy.

Wife will also use the EV for her 10 mile commute on the 2 days I don't use it.

So basically the car will just be used for lots of short journeys, so range isn't really a concern, however the more the merrier of course. About the furthest I could ever see me taking it would be to visit family 50 miles away. I have other cars I would use for longer journeys.

Considerations:

I can charge for free at work (just off a 3 pin plug however, but I'm there 8 hours each day)
I will be charging off a 3 pin plug at home also (Have access to 2 other cars so not mega worried about getting into a situation where the car cant be used because it hasn't finished charging)
Rural commute, avg speed 50mph.
Budget 10-15k but am flexible. Want something that isn't going to kill me in depreciation.
Warranty would be nice, but surely these EV's are reliable? Wishful thinking probably.


Things I would really like (although none are deal breakers):

Ability to pre-heat the car remotely.
Small footprint so I can park/charge it in a typical UK garage.
Folding mirrors to help with the above point.
I'm a bit of a geek so would like the ability to remotely connect to the car to check state of charge etc (not sure if this is even a thing).

So far the main consideration was a BMW i3 or i3S... because I am at heart a petrol head, and would love something that has some fun factor... however from looking around today I see EV's do seem to be plunging in price. Some very low mileage/new Zoe's seem to be available for under £15k, as well as many other options I probably haven't looked into.

Would love to hear people's thoughts/suggestions."

I'm Änder from Luxembourg, aged 44 and last week I ordered a Fiat 500e Cabrio after having felt to get an electric car for a certain time now. The Fiat will be my main car, replacing my 2015 Renault Mégane Coupé-Cabriolet with a Diesel engine and more than 100k km on the counter.

I like to go on hikes in my country, especially the Auto-Pédestres. Their name comes from driving with a car to the starting point and then walking marked circuits, there are about 200 of those in my tiny country.
Seeing whole forest parcels dying these last years, I thought I better switch from burning oil products to electric power, which can be produced in a much cleaner way after all.

I hope I'll find the answers I'm looking for here and maybe make some interesting contacts."

Range, obviously, it was a Model Y Long Range that could comfortably do 250 miles.
Ability to set a maximum state of charge, I used to set the Tesla at 80% max when charging overnight. Quite surprised I can't do that on the Peugeot.
Speed. Even the LR has ridiculous acceleration. I'm no boy racer though so can take it or leave it.
App just worked. Less steps to get it connected to the car and just leave it. Mobile as car key also good.
Heated seats. Didn't get them on the e-208, I gather they are an additional option.
Dog mode in the Tesla was regularly used.
Storage space, Model Y is obviously much bigger. But the e-208 boot is big enough for our spaniel so fine.
Frunk to carry charging cables

Overall, very happy with the change, always had a liking for little French hatchbacks and the e-208 seems a very good example of exactly that. It really is good to drive and pretty quick too."

Concerned about range since it would be our only car without a backup for longer trips. We have a driveway for installing a charging point, which would suffice most of the time. 

However, we often need to travel longer distances (150-200 miles, usually at night) to reach airports to visit family abroad with our young kids. This is as likely to be winter as any other time of year.

Wife's colleague says she had issues finding working charging points coming back from airports with a Citroen EC4, but unsure if it's exaggerated. 

How is life with an EV in the UK, especially Northern England? Availability and reliability of charging points?"

Went to check on car. Zappi light was Blue and not Red indicating a fault. 
Unplugged and plugged in again. Seems to start charging but then car ""clicks off"" again after about 5 seconds with same notification.
Issue with Zappi?? Had just been charging my wife's e-208 without issue.
So tried the Hyundai 3 pin granny cable. And exactly the same thing again. Car clicks off and stops charging after a few seconds. Although looking at dash.- No charge being taken on. Don't get the usual display of kW under the battery %, before it stops trying to charge. When car in ""Ready Mode""- dash display shows ""Check Electric Vehicle System"" with an orange warning light/triangle when it clicks off.

Everything else in car still works as normal including the power seats, and no other warning lights. So does not look like a 12v battery issue. Took car for a quick spin around the block. No problems. No warning lights. Came home. Plugged in but same problem on plugging in again. Been a brilliant car up to now and loving it but unable to charge is going to be a major issue!
Will call Hyundai in the morning. Looking at these forums this could well be the ""ICCU failure"" apparently afflicting many Hyundai/Kia and Genesis cars? At similar ages also.."

I was thinking about the use of Heat pumps in EV's yesterday and something occurred to me.

A heat pump is a great idea for reducing energy consumption of the heater - a COP (coefficient of performance) of 3 to 4 is typical for a heat pump, at least when the outside temperature is above about -10C. This means you get about 3 to 4 times the heat output compared to electrical input.

So a resistance heater (like the one in my Ion) which is 5kW when going flat out uses 5kW of energy, a heat pump could produce 5kW of heat from as little as 1250 - 1600 Watts, which is a major win.

Of course there are drawbacks too - a resistance heater is simple and bullet proof, while a heat pump is just an A/C system going in reverse so has all the same failure mechanisms - such as failing compressor, gas leaks, potential damage to the evap/condensor from road debris etc...

Also below about -10C they get less and less effective and may need the assistance of a resistance heater at very low (Canadian winter) temperatures, although probably not a big issue here in the UK. These trade-offs are well known, but another one occurred to me:

How do you defog the windscreen effectively in really wet/humid conditions around 5-12 degrees if you can't run both the heater and A/C at the same time ? In a conventional ICE or an EV with a resistance heater you can run both heater and A/C at the same time - the air first passes through the AC and is cooled, removing moisture and then passes through the heater to be warmed up again, resulting in warm, dry air that will remove even the worst fog like a magic wand.

Although it saps the battery badly I sometimes find myself forced to run the A/C and heater together (on low) in my Ion to keep the windows clear of fog, and of course its second nature to do this in my ICE where the heater is ""free"" and A/C has little effect on range.

But if you have a heat pump system in your EV do you just have a single dual purpose evaporator/condenser behind the dashboard that switches roles (by reversing the pump) depending on whether you want heating or cooling ? In which case it is impossible to both cool (to remove moisture) the airflow and then heat it up again at the same time ?

Or is there an ancillary resistance heater that you can turn on at the same time that the heat pump is in A/C mode, but at great energy expense ?

I'm interested to know how you find defogging your windows if you have a car with a heat pump system and whether there is indeed a range sapping ancillary resistance heater that needs to be put into action to both cool and heat at the same time... or whether you just find it more difficult to defog your windows in wet, humid conditions..."

            I don't really know about Stellantis but Tesla LFP battery are recommended to be charged to 100% at least once a week. Tesla going even further saying that you should plug the battery (the car) every night and leave it to fully charge. Considering the fact that almost all manufacturers get some or all of the batteries from CATL I guess that the battery is almost the same. The difference here comes with different BMS used by different car makers.
The same as the petrol coming out of Grangemouth...the base is the same, just the additive are a wee bit different.
        
Click to expand...

The simplest way for a BMS to balance the cells is simply to bleed off energy from the highest cells through a resistor at high SoC. This is how most BEV BMSs work. The main problem is that they typically balance very, very slowly. As in tens or hundreds of mA. This is why LEAF packs become unbalanced despite the BMS best efforts.

I guess LFP packs have extremely slow balancing so need to be left at high SoC so that the balancers can do their job.

More sophisticated fully-active balancing technologies exist but I know of no BEV that uses them.

Mercedes BEVs have an additional balancer at the bottom end which adds energy to the lowest cells.

Not sure how others do it they keep their cards close to their chest…"

So basically the car will just be used for lots of short journeys, so range isn't really a concern, however the more the merrier of course. About the furthest I could ever see me taking it would be to visit family 50 miles away. I have other cars I would use for longer journeys.

Considerations:

I can charge for free at work (just off a 3 pin plug however, but I'm there 8 hours each day)
I will be charging off a 3 pin plug at home also (Have access to 2 other cars so not mega worried about getting into a situation where the car cant be used because it hasn't finished charging)
Rural commute, avg speed 50mph.
Budget 10-15k but am flexible. Want something that isn't going to kill me in depreciation.
Warranty would be nice, but surely these EV's are reliable? Wishful thinking probably.


Things I would really like (although none are deal breakers):

Ability to pre-heat the car remotely.
Small footprint so I can park/charge it in a typical UK garage.
Folding mirrors to help with the above point.
I'm a bit of a geek so would like the ability to remotely connect to the car to check state of charge etc (not sure if this is even a thing).

So far the main consideration was a BMW i3 or i3S... because I am at heart a petrol head, and would love something that has some fun factor... however from looking around today I see EV's do seem to be plunging in price. Some very low mileage/new Zoe's seem to be available for under £15k, as well as many other options I probably haven't looked into.

Would love to hear people's thoughts/suggestions."

I moved to Cornwall in 2006 from Harlow, Essex, and since then I have noticed that cars are, in general, much older here. There is money here: more so since covid (a lot of people moved here after). But I do feel that in deepest Cornwall... Redruth, Camborne etc, money is tight and there are very few EVs owned by natives. So with that in mind, installing EV chargers could be seen as spending money for the holidaymakers and not for the locals and to an extent I'd agree with that.

Yes, eventually the less well-off places will catch up regarding EV ownership but I suspect that Cornwall will be one of the last places to do so in the UK."

Click to expand...

No, a 50kw charger will be limited to approximately 50kw.
Driving an ID3, all you really need to remember is that to get the best charge speed you need to arrive at the charging station with low % SoC (as low as you are comfortable aiming for) and outside of mid summer you need to have been driving for a while at a decent speed (to build up some heat in the battery). A couple of hours at 70 is usually enough for me. The algorithm that determines allowable charge speed seems to be quite complicated though, there is no point using a single curve to try to predict what you should expect. The absolute maximum possible is about 135kw, after which it will retain above 100kw to 29-30%, gradually dropping. But if you plug in at say 25% you will never see more than 80-90kw. Of course this is often absolutely fine if you are getting a coffee etc.
If you see a charger advertised as 150kw in my experience you will get what the ID3 can take (as discussed above, some are limited to 250A which would be about 105kw in an ID3, but most aren't, and in an ID3 that's pretty good anyway). If you pick a 120kw charger though, it's highly likely to be limited to 200A, which is about 80-85kw in an ID3. If you have arrived at very low SoC hoping for 120kw that would be annoying."

Ended up keeping my current car (Volvo XC60) and buying a second hand iD.3 for the wife which both of us use.  I must say I am enjoying more than I thought I would do. The software (despite being still in 2.4) is not THAT annoying (to me) and I do enjoy how the car rides and handles along with some small clever features. I have adaptive cruise, but no lane centering which is the only feature I wish it had (my Volvo has it). I am not saying it's perfect (no car is)

Anyway I am now thinking I should look at the Megane again to see if there's been any update to the specification list and to my surprise the waiting list for a new one is only about 2 weeks with quite a few available for immediate delivery. Pretty much everything else at the moment has a waiting list of several months.

Hence my question. Is it an own goal by Renault UK for specifying a lesser car for the UK?"

            I'm close to purchasing a used Corsa-e Elite Nav (20 reg) in a few days and wanted to get some input from current owners. The car I'm buying is around £15k for 8,000 miles. I was supposed to pick it up on the weekend when they found an issue with the on-board charger, which I suspect is a recall. They're replacing this but mentioned there is a slight delay in receiving the part. Which led me to hop onto this forum and read some worrying things about electric Corsa's! The car is left with 1 month's warranty, however the Vauxhall dealer are providing with another year on top. I've placed a refundable deposit to reserve the car. Is there anything I should be aware of? Since many people in this forum are talking about selling theirs after approx. 3 years which makes me question the low prices on the used market! Any advice would be appreciated.

I own an Elite Nav 2020 for 2.5 years now.. in the first year the wireling loom had to be replaced because the rear wiper wasn't working (lol..). In the second year I kept getting multiple ""Electric Traction System fault' errors which I could easily get rid of by turning the car off and on again. Unfortunately the last time I got this I had to get the car towed because the error prevented the car from going into drive mode. The cause of this.. a faulty A/C compressor which was not covered under warranty so I had to pay 1.5k euro.......... This has been replaced and I havent had any issues with the car since.

It's a really nice car if there are no issues. :')"

1. My wife does a 100 mile round trip commute at 60-70mph. Will the car need charged to get back home? At this time of yea our Zoe uses around 40kWh to make that journey.

            Hi -

Question is as per the subject - which of the popular EVs at the moment has what they call ""one pedal driving"" - from what I gather this means that you can set the regenerative braking to such a level that the car will completely stop on its own if you are driving smoothly and anticipating the stopping distances correctly?

Also - does this mean the brake lights come on automatically when you have this enabled as soon as you take your foot off the accelerator?
        
Click to expand...

I thought all EV can do that?
at least on my old i3, there are no setting, only 1 level of regen, only way to adjust the regen is my right foot. (i.e. no cruising available)
As soon as I lift the pedal the car slow down, and when the regen force pass certain point the brake light turn on. It will come to complete stop if I time and judge correctly. Will not hold the car if the decline is too steep."

New member here looking to get my first EV.  I've already posted over in the Renault Zoe section as that's what I'm considering (budget is £13k so it will have to be a used / secondhand one).  Just something small for my wife's commute to work (a 30 mile round trip) and some local journeys.  We'll keep an ICE for longer distance stuff and for me to use. 

This seems to to be a very knowledgable place and I'm keen to learn (yesterday I had to look up ""granny cable"").  I'm new here but not to forums -- I'm also on tz-uk and mwr for watches quite a lot and very occasionally in the Fedora Lounge (vintage clothes), the Shaving Room (traditional razors, soaps etc) and PistonHeads (cars).

I normally drive a Zoe but it's going off the road today, possibly for some time, for a repair. I've been offered a Fiat 500e as a replacement, It's possibly the 42kWh version, but I don't know if other sizes are available - the garage quoted a 160 mile range but the Fiat website says ""up to 199"".

I'm just wondering if there's any ""gotchas"" about having a different car temporarily, eg.

1. My wife does a 100 mile round trip commute at 60-70mph. Will the car need charged to get back home? At this time of yea our Zoe uses around 40kWh to make that journey.

2. Does the Fiat have standard (type 2) home charging? We have a Zappi at home.

3. Is the Fiat CCS for fast charging?

Anything else we should watch out for?"

            No, A Leaf, in e-pedal mode, which is selectable by push-button, brings the car to a complete stop using regen and friction brakes automatically.

Any other definition is not one pedal driving.

As it happens, I prefer the set up in the Lexus 300e which uses regen which is set with paddles to slow the car to ""creep"" if you wait long enough and then when you touch the brake, you are in auto hold.  Also the Adaptive cruise is much more refined in the Lexus.

Have a watch of the videos above they actually show the cars in the regen mode coming to a complete stop (without the driver touching the brake pedal)

I've just added the Tesla video above too where you have the choice of creep, roll or to a complete stop when you lift off the pedal.

The only thing it won't be called is e-Pedal for other manufacturers as that's a trademark of Nissan. Hyundai calling it i-Pedal. BMW/Tesla don't seem to have bothered to trademark a word to call it. One Pedal and Stopping Mode."

I've just had my faulty Zoe swapped (by a Cinch driver - so basically BCA) and I asked him about this. He said he'd suggest it as it's a good idea.

My replacement car came from a Cinch Depot in Corby, so it looks like Elmo have finally branched out from just one depot in Upper Heyford/Oxfordshire.


Here's my experience of the ""swap"" - I've written pretty much the same on the Onto forums as people there are complaining they are getting damage notifications post-collection that they weren't expecting.


He was here for an hour - and quite literally spent 30 minutes detailing the entire of my new car (102 miles on the clock) and then 30 minutes on my broken car, again detailing it to perfection. I had to sign off on all the damage they’d noted, agree to it etc. He took measurements of every single nick, scuff, dent, mark and whatnot. The photos are crystal clear, and he’s taken a long, up close video of each car as well.

I’ve already been emailed both condition reports, within minutes of them being completed.

I asked the driver who had asked for the detailed reports, and his response that it was Elmo who had requested it (and always do now)."

The screen mirrors do work really well but if you're a certain age the driver's side one can be just in the area of vision that is in the needs reading glasses distance. I did get used to it but it did make by eyes weird at times.

Ride is also quite firm but it corners flat as anything. Power steering is clever and weights up at higher speeds but it does mean the car sometimes feels weird when you change direction. 

Road noise seems quite intrusive in a way I wasn't expecting. It's definitely  louder inside than the Corsa.

Turning circle is fantastic. Stereo is so good I almost ignored all the other negatives. 

Steering wheel is also kind of sweaty compared to the cheaper feeling Corsa one. 

Boot is very shallow which I didn't grasp. I thought it was shallower horizontally but taller (like the Soul EV). It's very shallow in height but a bit longer in depth. I did have the measurements but somehow they didn't translate to my brain. 

Range. Hmmm. Did 30 odd miles and it had about 60% battery or so which isn't any good as my usual trip is 55 and all year so it wasn't going to be quite up to it. It was quite efficient at times and once you'd been going for a bit and were bimbling along at 30-40 it did go up quite a bit. Over all was 3.3 miles per kWh on the mixed run. Think the Corsa would have actually done better. With a tiny battery you have to be much more efficient. It needed to have been Kia efficient as I'd reckon one of those would have been about 4 -4.5 miles per kWh doing the same.

One pedal mode is quite good but even on max death the regen feels weaker than I expected. It was weaker feeling than the Corsa which is quite weak. The Leaf had very strong regen in B mode and also with E Pedal. That was neck snapping in comparison.

Other issue was with reversing onto a sloping driveway. It didn't like it. Mine slopes down and it seems to upset quite a few cars. The corsa I just stick in reverse and it creeps in reverse with the brake on happily. I turned off the one pedal in the Honda and it didn't seem to want to creep so you hit the gas, it lurches off you hit the brake and it's at a dead halt so you are making a right hash of a simple thing.  

I'm glad a drove one as it's been one of those cars I haven't stopped obsessing over since they came out."

use it for another year or two for journeys that actually need a big car

So I have a Kona and love it, the other half loves driving the Kona because of the electric, but doesn’t want one as it’s to big 😅 we were considering a Zoe (she has a Mazda 2 at the moment) but really like the style and quirkyness of the Fiat 500e!

It’ll be a 2nd car so it’s not doing long journeys, but what’s the backseats like for kids? YouTube reviews seem a bit mixed with some people saying it’s fine and others not. We have a 5 year old (in a high back booster) and a 12 year old, but realistically 90% of the time the 12 year old would be in the passenger seat and just the 5 year old in the back (there might be the rare occasion where one of them has a friend in the car as well but that’s a really specific circumstance not the norm). If it was all 4 of us we’d be using my Kona, but for when the other half is doing school runs and the odd trip to town etc, what’s peoples thoughts on the 500e? Anyone here have kids and use the back seats? How do they find it

I do totally understand, the Zoe is going to be more practical… but the 500e is a characterful little car!

Thanks!"

I have had my Sync.24.7 charger installed on my driveway at home and am very happy with it. However, I have stumbled across a problem regardiing the charge cable.

Once the cable is in place and charging has commenced the cable is locked into the car and the wall. Once the charge is complete and the led flashes Yellow to indicate so, the tether unlocks from the wall. if you remove the cable fromthe wall you can then remove ot from the car, without your keys and with the car locked.

My charging is usaully complete at 2am therefore  after 2am anyone can remove the cable and walk off with it without any problem. These cables cost around £100 to replace and I doubt it will take long before the light fingered members of our society will work out that if a yellow flashing light is clearly displayed then the cable is there for the taking.

I have contacted Sync EV.24.7 regarding this issue and to date have not received a responce.

Please tell me there is a setting that I'm missing to secure the cable post charge that will  ensure  the cable can not be removed so I can turn off my alarm setting for 2am and sleep through the night."

We've tried the Fiat 500 E and Mini Electric but the current favourite is a 2021 Zoe.

We've been over to the local Renault dealer who have a few low mileage 2021's for sale. So far we've had a quick spin in one of them to check the driveablility, boot space, seating setup etc. but we're going back for another test drive with a reserved car this weekend.

We've had the Tesla since new (6 years) so familiar with the EV experience & have home charging. Living north of the border we're also familiar with finding/using public rapids & have a ChargePlace Scotland card so that side of things should be covered. I'd be interested in any tips/things to look for on a nearly new car, e.g. checking software is up-to-date, battery health (unlikely to be an issue on a newish car?), included accessories (do Renault typically provide a granny charger or Type 2 cable?).

We've had a look at a couple of YouTube reviews so are aware of the lack of side impact airbags but other than that the Zoe looks like an excellent value-for-money proposition. I've also seen this really helpful thread (apologies, there's probably a neater way to link to it!):

            Hello all,

I've been somewhat absent from this forum for the last few years and feel a little guilty for returning with much in the way of questions and little in the way of answers. In my defence, my 2016 R220 Zoe has been a sterling car aside from the PEC replacement early in its life, so it has kind of faded to the back of my mind as other aspects of my life have come to the fore.

Anyway, to get back on topic, the lack of range in my R220 combined with the awkwardness of planning routes to take in 22kW AC chargers has led me to contemplate moving on to a ZE50, which leads me to my questions...

Aside from:

Crackling when charging
BMS update
Preconditioning issues (I know this was a thing, but I can't seem to find any related threads on this forum. Perhaps I'm just not using the right search terms.)
Timed charging issues

Is there anything else that I need to look out for on a 2020 Zoe?

And what of the 2021 Zoes? Were all of these issues fixed by the time 2021 rolled around? I'm wondering if there's any advantage to spending extra money to get a 2021 Zoe and (hopefully) avoid any ""teething troubles"" that affected the early ZE50s.

Any help or advice would be appreciated and, if you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read my verbose post!

Pete

No intention to buy with finance, this will be a cash purchase from my savings. I am an active retiree, just sold my Nissan Leaf 40kwh that I have enjoyed over the past two years. My driving is mainly local up to say 60 miles return, with longer journeys a few times a week of up to 160 miles or a tad further. So basically help me with my options. Your views and opinions will be valued.


So, first option another Leaf. Possibly a secondhand 62kwh E Plus at 26k. But I have owned a Leaf for over two years now and really fancy a change. How about an ID3 ? Yes, but new they are £35k for the poverty spec Life model and £35k is close to a price of a secondhand high mileage Model 3. Maybe bust my budget and buy an early 2019 Model 3 then, but with all my funds spent to the max then I would be living off bread and water…..

Then there is the new Cupra Born, priced from £34k new. Better spec than the ID3 at a cheaper price. How about a used early Model S, seen some of these on Autotrader priced at £32k. But that could be a risky purchase with no warranty. If anything went pop then with no cash funds left I would be up shit creek, in a leaking  boat, with no paddle. Lastly, here is a wild card. The Peugeot e2008. Drove a 2020 GT line model a few days ago,priced at £29k. Absolutely loved it, lovely interior, good ride,loads of kit,in many ways I liked it better than the ID3.

So, help me decide…."

We have a self catering cottage in Ayr, on the West coast of Scotland. For some time we have wanted to install a 7kw charger for guests to use. However, being a small unit, we are not sure we can absorb the onging charging costs (we are of course happy to pay out the installation charge etc). At present, there doesn't appear to be an affordable solution which would allow guests to pay (just to cover the charge of the electricity) via the EV charger/app. I should stress we are NOT looking to make money, just cover the ongoing electricity costs.

Do you look to your holiday accommodation providers to offer EV charging? If so, what or how do you pay? Is a daily rate feasible. - bearing in mind we have folk staying for one night or multiple nights. How would you see it working and what would work for you?

So I have a Kona and love it, the other half loves driving the Kona because of the electric, but doesn’t want one as it’s to big 😅 we were considering a Zoe (she has a Mazda 2 at the moment) but really like the style and quirkyness of the Fiat 500e!

It’ll be a 2nd car so it’s not doing long journeys, but what’s the backseats like for kids? YouTube reviews seem a bit mixed with some people saying it’s fine and others not. We have a 5 year old (in a high back booster) and a 12 year old, but realistically 90% of the time the 12 year old would be in the passenger seat and just the 5 year old in the back (there might be the rare occasion where one of them has a friend in the car as well but that’s a really specific circumstance not the norm). If it was all 4 of us we’d be using my Kona, but for when the other half is doing school runs and the odd trip to town etc, what’s peoples thoughts on the 500e? Anyone here have kids and use the back seats? How do they find it

I do totally understand, the Zoe is going to be more practical… but the 500e is a characterful little car!

As I said a while ago, It was never going to be £25K for the longer range CAT with current PICG!  Maybe with the old £3500 PICG they could have done a lower spec one at that price. It was inevitable the first model would be higher priced, but I thought they would try to keep it below £30K.

My partner placed order for a Corsa-e back in late January. A few weeks later we were passing by so went into the dealer to ask about any updates, who said we have a build date on an early week in March and delivery expected early-mid April. All good. Back then the estimated delivery on the Vauxhall online store was around 7 weeks too. So that matches.

Last week the dealer called telling us the batteries are made in Ukraine and the factory has been bombed so now we don't know when the car will arrive, 'but it might be September'. Now, I don't think the batteries are made in Ukraine but maybe another part, but anyway.

Looking at Aston Vauxhall, they list a current estimated arrival time of week 38, which is September. The Vauxhall online store gives an estimated delivery of 25 weeks for all trims, which is also mid-September.

So the fact that any order made in late January has the same estimated arrival as one ordered today makes me wonder if something has gone wrong and the dealer didn't actually order the car. Surely if there's such a backlog a car ordered today should be arriving well after one ordered in January.

Unsurprisingly, the kind of deal I got on the Ioniq doesn't exist any more, either as a lease or a PCP. (I've asked about extending the lease but the terms of the renewed contract are not favourable.)

After some basic calculations (fuel economy, insurance and projected running costs), the savings I'd make over the course of a year at today's electricity/petrol prices using an EV instead of an ICE with decent economy (~50 MPG) are wiped out by the extra cost of leasing/PCPing another EV.

Unless I'm missing something, buying a used ICE would seem to be the most economical solution.

Please feel free to point out anything I may have missed.

            Out of interest, where does the 3kg of CO2/ litre of petrol come from?
        
Click to expand...

I first came across it in various posts on this forum.

There are several carbon calculators from authoritative sites (eg US EPA and others) that give carbon content calculations for 1 litre of petrol (well, you need to convert from US gallons, and they call it gasoline...) which are around the 2.3-2.4kg range. But these values do not include the carbon cost that goes into refining oil into petrol or diesel. That adds about 30% for petrol and 25% for diesel. This means that burning a litre of petrol in a car accounts for about 3kg of carbon. Note; pedants will quibble over small percentages associated with the above figures, however it's a reasonable estimate IMO (I would also accept that minor differences are significant when multiplied over millions/billions of vehicles and miles... but for the purpose of illustration, these numbers are OK).

Having driven petrol and diesel powered vehicles for almost 40 years, i'd never realised that fuel was so carbon intensive (i'd guessed that the carbon cost was about 1kg/l based purely upon mass - i've a PhD in life sciences and have always been a bit crap at chemistry !). I suspect most consumers don't realise this, and some (most ?) won't care.

The thing to keep in mind about the 'green-ness' of electric cars is that their carbon cost comes partly from manufacture and partly from the source of electricity to power them. So, if you only burn coal to make 'leccy, there's not much carbon saving (if any). Electric cars are a little more carbon intensive to make than ICE ones (due to the battery), but this can* be 'repaid' once you start driving them using a 'mixed with renewables' electricity grid. There's estimates out there of how many miles you need to cover for different models to reach 'breakeven' and then start saving. For me, i'd surmise that my EV is saving about 50% of the carbon versus an ICE (modest...) and makes for better air quality. Plus, it's waaaay more enjoyable to drive."

My wife and I live about an hour north of Glasgow and have made the decision to switch to electric. We have a diesel Subaru Outback and a Fiat Panda 4x4 but they’re going soon -a Tesla is on the way within a month with something small for me to runabout in for work. It’s pretty mountainy where we are and I’m looking for something that can handle a 30 mile each way trip a few times a week - this commute has a 400m climb each way, single track wi lots of stopping/starting on the return leg. I’ve looked at a few of the less expensive options and I’m a wee bit unsure of how well they’ll do on the uphills and whether there’s any prospect of battery regen on the way down the hills ?

We’re all in on this change, it’s something we should’ve done some time ago but we cannot wait to get into it.

All the best

I think it is worth remembering the landscape when it launched. I was meeting with Honda UK at the time and there was very little in the city car category with a lot more range.  They had a very clear target audience of middle to high income drivers in cities, particularly London where it would be seen as a stylish 'accessory' as a 2nd vehicle. The kind of people who drive maybe 60-80 miles a week.

One of the challenges is that there is so much more choice now; Mini, ORA Cat and 500e are obvious choices and they can all go further for the odd journey if you wish.

We are thinking about having a fun small EV for mainly city use and I would really like a Honda e. But we had a 500e for two weeks in the coldest week in the winter and still managed to get over 120 miles on the motorway.

            No, A Leaf, in e-pedal mode, which is selectable by push-button, brings the car to a complete stop using regen and friction brakes automatically.

Any other definition is not one pedal driving.

As it happens, I prefer the set up in the Lexus 300e which uses regen which is set with paddles to slow the car to ""creep"" if you wait long enough and then when you touch the brake, you are in auto hold.  Also the Adaptive cruise is much more refined in the Lexus.

Have a watch of the videos above they actually show the cars in the regen mode coming to a complete stop (without the driver touching the brake pedal)

I've just added the Tesla video above too where you have the choice of creep, roll or to a complete stop when you lift off the pedal.

The only thing it won't be called is e-Pedal for other manufacturers as that's a trademark of Nissan. Hyundai calling it i-Pedal. BMW/Tesla don't seem to have bothered to trademark a word to call it. One Pedal and Stopping Mode."

            It's not just about the impact of an EV now vs the impact of an ICE now, though. I hope not too many people are under the illusion that if they run an EV their impact is zero, any more than if they have a magical '100% renewable' energy tariff. What it's really about for me is the direction of travel. In ten years time we almost all need to be driving EVs and we need to be generating much more of our electricity without gas, if we are to meet our climate targets. For there to be a chance of that, those of us who can, should be starting to drive EVs now, because we can't all change at once. Because I was in a position that I was able to do so now, I felt like I should. It's also about setting an example and showing people who are more nervous of the change that EVs are actually good cars now - the more there are on the road the better from that perspective. The immediate carbon reduction is obviously a benefit but I completely agree with you it is not huge.

Because the rest of the world is using renewables while we hobble ourselves?

The public at large are absolutely under the impression that if they suddenly drive an EV they are somehow carbon neutral. The EV will magically offset all their other middle class carbon use such as multiple holidays abroad and huge houses.

I remember working 2 summers ago when the climate protests were on in London - I had upper middle class patients call in on the way to ferrying their offspring to climate protests in their Rangerovers LOL - honestly the irony is so lost on them! - they had no idea!

Buy and EV but continue to consume all we can LOL!

Meanwhile we have shifted all our manufacturing to the 3rd world and east so while we may not be polluting our own back yard, the poor Chinese / Indian / Indonesian person can have the water table toxins..... but were zero carbon in the UK!!!!!!!!!! (just done mention our Amazon buying habits)."

            Nearly all cars EV or ICE used to loose 50% of their new list value at 3 years old 2019 and before especially pre 2009 with historical normal 5%+ interest rates.   GFC 1% IR 2009-2021, Covid 2020-2022 was an anomaly, 2023 and 2024 a return to mean.  

In fact after writing this, it occurred to me EV's have never been for sale in both a normal interest rate and depreciation period 1970's-2008.
        
Click to expand...

I'd have to disagree with most of what you said there.

Although cars historically have been generally worth 40-50% of RRP at 3 years old, no one paid RRP for a new car besides the blip of 2022 that saw some people paying more than new RRP for a nearly new BEV.

For German motors, a 15% discount on a new car was easily achievable. For Ford/Vauxhall/French/Italian cars 20-30% discount was easy too, for all but the niche cars like Focus RS, especially on model run-outs or when you had fields full of over produced Vauxhalls.

No one actually lost 50% of the RRP of their new car over 3 years, and those cars were generally cheaper to buy in the first place. 

Now we have BEVs costing a lot more than  their ICEV equivalents, having little to no discount and similar or worse retained values.

What do you consider ""normal"" interest rates? Normal/stable to me means around 4%,we saw base interest rates as high as 15% during a lot of the 80%, and 13 years of crazy low interest rates from 2008 - 2021. Mid 90s to mid naughties was pretty normal, but the 50 year period you cite has had some extended periods of extreme interest rates either way.

The prospect of buying a £40k BEV on PCP at or near RRP with an £18-20k GFV will be leaving people with a minimum of £650pm bill on 0% finance or maybe as much as £900pm on current typical car finance iterest rates. It wasn't long ago that people baulked at paying £400pm for a £32k Golf GTI.

The finance arms of the marques were making more money than the manufacturers for a long time. Right now, the only way of making PCP palatable is for the finance companies to be offering 0% APR."

I did 10 miles that cost me 10% yesterday, so that's pretty much the same as you're seeing.

            Must be a masochist! We're camping in our 27kWh Soul on the south coast of France as we speak...

It took us about four days driving to get from central Scotland to the south coast via Eurotunnel. We've got the tent on the roof so realistically only get 75 miles range.

So far it has been fine, having the small battery is definitely a compromise but at least we get plenty of breaks from driving! Pleasantly surprised by the Total 175kW chargers which actually deliver a peak of 65kW for our little Soul! (None of the supposed 100kW CHAdeMO from BP pulse ever gave us that - only ones in the UK that do are the Shell Recharge 175kW Tritium units). It means a 15 minute recharge mostly.

We have the Chargemap card, Plugsurfing fob, KhiWhi pass, Shell Recharge pass and IZIVIA card. 
Realistically you could probably get by with just the Chargemap pass and Shell Recharge.

The OP may come a cropper with the per minute pricing though, if they've only got 22kW charging.  Though there are lots of 22kW posts (non rapids) that charge a reasonable per minute rate.

It all depends on your perspective and the amount of time you've got for the trip.

Like many, we absolutely love the car but are slightly concerned about range. As Londoners, 99% of the time it'll be absolutely outstanding, however, we are a tad concerned about what sort of range to expect when we're doing longer journeys. 

They seldom happen, (1-2 times a year), but when they do, they're typically long and we're not on a jolly, but instead aiming to get from A to B as fast as possible. 

We currently have a C350e PHEV and have made the 1000 mile trip from London to Bratislava numerous times before with an overnight in Frankfurt. During our last trip I made a concerted effort to plug the car in at every services we visited and I'm pleased to say that across Belgium, Germany and Austria we were able to activate AC chargers without issue. Adding CCS and bringing Ionity into the mix means I'm not concerned about finding chargers as they're plentiful along the E40 in Belgium, the A3 that takes us across Germany and the route across Austria. 

What does worry me slightly is how often we'll need to stop... My test drive gave me a chance to loosely measure consumption at about 220wh/km in mild, 14-degree conditions doing 70-75mph, but I'm not sure what range to expect of the car with the heat pump running with thicker air to power through in 0-3 degree temperatures... Would 100 miles of range be achievable ingreen mode and at a reduced speed of 120km/h/75mph? 

Obviously only time will tell, but I'd be interested to hear the winter motorway range experiences of owners on this forum to have a rough idea of how many stops the trip will truly require, otherwise it may just be all too hard and require the plane!"

i probably wouldn't get a leaf. Winter range is poor and it's chademo and the charge speed is poor. Build quality is better but the infotainment etc and interior is like a museum. Also they don't have steering wheel reach adjust until late 2020 so earlier ones can be uncomfortable.

Corsa is ok but let down by poor software and often useless dealers. Still miss the headlights as they are excellent. It is fun to drive too.  I checked my old one  and it's showing a recall so that's at least the second it's had in only 2 years. Outside warranty I think it could be bothersome as too many owners seem to have had problems.

Zoe ZE50 is more efficient but has poor NCAP safety. I'd check out its failings. if it's just rear passengers and you don't have them then it won't matter. I'd try one. Certain ones have the 5 year warranty not the lesser one. They're a safer buy. There's been some silly cheap ones about."

I have a 4 mile commute that I could walk in less than an hour if I really needed to, and if it wasn't for the 80 mile family-visit trip I do once a fortnight (or longer) I probably would do just that and walk it.

Yet ... that still adds up to 6,000 miles. Plus the vey rare bits of shopping and an outing to a National Trust or such, I'm not particularly sociable so really next to no excess mileage above that, I can look to be doing about 7,000 a year at the moment.

For basically 'no miles a year' from my POV.

So my question of the hour .... why do people even bother to get a car if a 5,000 miles a year lease would cover their needs?

It's always struck me, and I feel it is as true now as when I said it in the age of 22kWh cars, if you do too few miles an EV is likely too expensive and not worth it, and if you do too many then an EV won't suit.

BEVs live in a range of 'golden miles', and as I have alluded to in other threads, not only on cost but also on CO2 grounds, right now this precise moment it makes more sense for me (personally) to stick with an efficient Euro 6 diesel. I'm not in that golden zone of miles that makes BEV a particularly sensible option.

I'm not wanting to debate the relative calculations, and for someone looking for a new car and in different circumstances they will have different needs and outcomes.

But the thrust of my thesis here is that anyone who only 'needs' 5k miles a year probably doesn't 'need' any miles at all.

I'd have said, these days with batteries as they are, if you are doing 12k to 15k miles a year, you'd be pretty dumb not to go for a BEV. 15k to 30k a BEV will pay in spades if it covers your particular mileage, or you probably could do with a PHEV to eek out the dino juice, or above 30k really it is an ICE for you. At 5k to 12k it will depend very much on your circumstances if you already have a car whether it makes sense to swap it out (like mine, short trips with occasional long, or regular 50 mile round trip commute?, ICE or BEV is usually fairly clear).

Do you look to your holiday accommodation providers to offer EV charging? If so, what or how do you pay? Is a daily rate feasible. - bearing in mind we have folk staying for one night or multiple nights. How would you see it working and what would work for you?

Have to say I had to go to Sofia for a meeting the Summer before the big close down and took a few days there and travelled out some distance. Although I travel a huge amount across EMEA-R and Far East for work and have been lucky enough to see most places, Bulgaria was off my territory. What an absolutely amazing country. And Sofia was great with one of the finest steakhouses I've been to anywhere. I had no idea the rural areas were so beautiful and honestly speaking it is on one of our theoretical routes down to Istanbul.

Thanks for sharing your experiences with the JB2. And how have you got on away from home charging? Do you have any examples and locations were you have used it and how easy (or not) it has been to date?

Also would you be able to drop by to the thread every now and again with your experiences? I think a lot of folks would be very interested in how you get on with it .... especially in a region on the baby slopes of developing infrastructure.

I’m glad you like it around here  Hopefully tourism will recover quickly after the health crisis gets resolved, one way or another.

I rely mostly on home and destination charging right now. Typical journeys this season are less than 250km.

My employers parking has two 22kW chargers available, but I carry the JB2 in case they’re occupied. I’ve got permission to use the CEE 16 sockets in the underground parking if needed.

I also have an adapter from CEE 16 to a Russian-style 25A socket that’s popular in old buildings here. It uses a combined PEN conductor (no separate earth pin) so it’s strictly for emergencies. It seems to work fine though.

So no actual experience to share yet apart from some test runs. But I feel well prepared 

I’ll share my experience with the fast charging networks in the region once we start doing longer journeys."

I have a 4 mile commute that I could walk in less than an hour if I really needed to, and if it wasn't for the 80 mile family-visit trip I do once a fortnight (or longer) I probably would do just that and walk it.

Yet ... that still adds up to 6,000 miles. Plus the vey rare bits of shopping and an outing to a National Trust or such, I'm not particularly sociable so really next to no excess mileage above that, I can look to be doing about 7,000 a year at the moment.

For basically 'no miles a year' from my POV.

So my question of the hour .... why do people even bother to get a car if a 5,000 miles a year lease would cover their needs?

It's always struck me, and I feel it is as true now as when I said it in the age of 22kWh cars, if you do too few miles an EV is likely too expensive and not worth it, and if you do too many then an EV won't suit.

BEVs live in a range of 'golden miles', and as I have alluded to in other threads, not only on cost but also on CO2 grounds, right now this precise moment it makes more sense for me (personally) to stick with an efficient Euro 6 diesel. I'm not in that golden zone of miles that makes BEV a particularly sensible option.

I'm not wanting to debate the relative calculations, and for someone looking for a new car and in different circumstances they will have different needs and outcomes.

But the thrust of my thesis here is that anyone who only 'needs' 5k miles a year probably doesn't 'need' any miles at all.

I'd have said, these days with batteries as they are, if you are doing 12k to 15k miles a year, you'd be pretty dumb not to go for a BEV. 15k to 30k a BEV will pay in spades if it covers your particular mileage, or you probably could do with a PHEV to eek out the dino juice, or above 30k really it is an ICE for you. At 5k to 12k it will depend very much on your circumstances if you already have a car whether it makes sense to swap it out (like mine, short trips with occasional long, or regular 50 mile round trip commute?, ICE or BEV is usually fairly clear).

5k? Get a bike ...."

Hi there, I have a 500e icon on lease and it was all going good untill a month ago I kept getting a onscreen warning saying something is wrong with the passenger airbag and the SOS assistance.

I called fiat and they said take it to my local dealer but I didn't have time as it's 16 mile away and I go to work. But then as of  a couple of week ago I was sometimes getting a seatbelt warning symbol and sound and it seemed to only happen when I was turning left lol....I tried to pull on the seatbelt in different directions and where it clips in to recreate the warning but it never happene donly when I drive and turn left.

And now I keep getting all those warning but no it says one pedal driving unavailable and to use the normal break...and yep in range and Sherpa when this wanting happens I take foot of accelerator and the car keeps going...no refen breaking

Just drove from work tonight and I had to drive 5 mile with all these warnings going off. I stopped my car twice turned it off but still happened.

I've had the car since may I think it is...end of April start of may.

And to top all that off last week lifting my boot lid I heard something rolling around inside my boot door/lid...where inside the boot you have that odd plastic that's coated in material covering the boot lid/door internals it sounds like sometjings come off inside there and rolling around when I'm driving or opening the boot.

I have a feeling fiat will tell me to take it to my dealer but it's under warranty but I need a car to get to work and back so it's not like I can leave my car with them longer than 4 to 5 hours as I start work at 3pm."

            First hand experience ... super stuff Bender and very much appreciated.

Have to say I had to go to Sofia for a meeting the Summer before the big close down and took a few days there and travelled out some distance. Although I travel a huge amount across EMEA-R and Far East for work and have been lucky enough to see most places, Bulgaria was off my territory. What an absolutely amazing country. And Sofia was great with one of the finest steakhouses I've been to anywhere. I had no idea the rural areas were so beautiful and honestly speaking it is on one of our theoretical routes down to Istanbul.

Thanks for sharing your experiences with the JB2. And how have you got on away from home charging? Do you have any examples and locations were you have used it and how easy (or not) it has been to date?

Also would you be able to drop by to the thread every now and again with your experiences? I think a lot of folks would be very interested in how you get on with it .... especially in a region on the baby slopes of developing infrastructure.

I’m glad you like it around here  Hopefully tourism will recover quickly after the health crisis gets resolved, one way or another.

I rely mostly on home and destination charging right now. Typical journeys this season are less than 250km.

My employers parking has two 22kW chargers available, but I carry the JB2 in case they’re occupied. I’ve got permission to use the CEE 16 sockets in the underground parking if needed.

I also have an adapter from CEE 16 to a Russian-style 25A socket that’s popular in old buildings here. It uses a combined PEN conductor (no separate earth pin) so it’s strictly for emergencies. It seems to work fine though.

So no actual experience to share yet apart from some test runs. But I feel well prepared 

I’ll share my experience with the fast charging networks in the region once we start doing longer journeys."

But Tesla is not the only name in town. Since most EVs have Level 1 (adaptive cruise control), I will just attempt to list the ones that have Level 2. No one in Europe (or the world for that matter, sans Japan) sells a Level 3 and above cars.

Level 2 (Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Centering), incomplete list:

Audi E-tron
Ford Mustang Mach-e (hands free)
Fiat 500e La Prima
Honda E
Hyundai Ioniq
Hyundai Ioniq 5 (hands free, lane change assist)
Hyundai Kona
Jaguar I-Pace 
Kia Niro EV (higher trims have even more autonomous features)
Mazda CX-30
MG MG5 LR
Nissan Leaf (called ProPilot)
Porsche Taycan
Tesla: all Tesla models are legally Level 2
VW Id3, Id4
How well these autonomous features work in practice varies a lot. Jerkiness in steering and braking under ACC are very common problems. Also L2 in heavy rain/snow are pretty much unsolved.

Now for pure speculation on the current major players, 100% my opinion:

Argo AI: This company has backing from both VW and Ford (each has 40% share) and it is already running a level 4 Fleet, and will soon be charging money for their Robo taxi service. VW also wants to sell this self driving as a service.
Aptiv aka Hyundai aka Motional: They're still betting on Robo taxi but undoubtedly the tech will drip down to your Ioniq/EV6 eventually.
Toyota: I'm still disappointed about Toyota's bet on Hydrogen, which could turn out to be another environmental disaster. But they've been investing heavily in self driving tech, and have announce significant spending in EVs. They recently bought out Level 5 (used to belong to Lyft and have a very significant UK presence)
Tesla: The elephant in the room, with the most publicity. They also have the most number of high profile crashes. But thousands of drivers swear by it.
There are of course many other ventures not listed here (Waymo for example but they don't sell cars, they sell a service). If want a car with good autonomous assist in the near future that's not a Tesla, my bet will be on ArgoAI's ventures aka Ford/VW. The technology seems most matured and both companies are committed to EV (for the VW case it's a matter of survival)."

You really can’t take 20-25 minutes out of the journey to charge on the way back?

You’ll likely be at around 30% when you arrive at your daughters place, if you can charge in the basement on the destination chargers you can work out what charge you’d leave with once you know how long you’ll be there and what power the chargers are.

You may find either you won’t need to charge at all to get back or require a very quick stop. If the chargers don’t work then the worst case is you’ll just need a slightly longer stop on the way home. 

You’ll need to charge to 80%+ dependent on how far away from your destination you stop on the way, you don’t know what the weather will be like on the way back etc."

So now I'm looking for a buyer for a car that was supposedly going to hold its value well seing as the limited edition was to be the only one with leather seats and black headlining until Vx decided to screw everyone that bought the Launch Edition and let anyone who wanted the same spec to have the Ultimate and to have a choice of colour.

I have had my Megane e-Tech Launch edition for a few months now and even though the weather is much warmer than when I collected the car in January, I noticed that the range is not really improving. I was under the impression that it would change based on several conditions, including the temperature.
Does anyone know if I need to do anything to reset the range? I cannot see an option to reset it but would really appreciate some help if someone knows what to do.

            I’m with you there (the 95% part). I idly spec’d up a Cupra Born yesterday, nice but flippin expensive, even allowing for the 77kWh battery on that particular spec.  Hmmm….

I did the same some time ago.
You have to have the 3 with the heatpump and the better whatever it was and pay for paint and whoops expensive hot hatch.

I should be taking delivery of a Megane Launch Edition late December or perhaps if there are delays a little later. The plan is to have 0 expectations of the Renault app and only use it to check the charge and perhaps pre condition if it's hot or cold.
So now I'm looking for a buyer for a car that was supposedly going to hold its value well seing as the limited edition was to be the only one with leather seats and black headlining until Vx decided to screw everyone that bought the Launch Edition and let anyone who wanted the same spec to have the Ultimate and to have a choice of colour. In old money, that is a damn swiz.

If the Megane goes pear-shaped I'll hang on for another year to see what else comes along but Vx have treated me very poorly as have the dealership and all deserve dysentry for Christmas

            I don't really think that this is clear cut and dry situation. Perhaps this was an issue at the beginning of the EV era. Today is a different picture all together. They are a few forums (Tesla mainly) with discussion about battery life and degradation. Over the pond they have virtually thousands upon thousands cars with over 300K on the clocks and average degradation for this sort of a mileage is about 12%.
I personally wouldn't be worried too much. For a start almost all EV manufacturers are offering 8/10 years and 100+K miles warranty on drive train and batteries. This is a lot more than any ICE car for a start... If the manufacturers are confident enough to provide this kind of cover for me this is indication that the expectations are for at least another 50/60K miles on top of the 100K offered as warranty.
Just drive the damn thing and don't worry too much.

You are right, except that charging is a frequently discussed, and pretty infected subject even on other forums, not just Tesla. I am on a BMW i4 also, and it can get pretty hot over there as well unless you agree with the mainstream, which is literally never go below 20% and never charge above 80%. Of course, that is nonsense, but there are many who believe that those values are some sort of brick wall. My logic says the same as your logic, even if my battery is degraded by 10-15% after 100k miles, that will take many years and if in say 5-10 years time my range will drop by 10-15%... well... who cares? If the range drops too much, i.e. noticeably lower then there is the battery warranty anyway."

I live in a rather good part of town and it was in a private drive for the night. Unfortunately, I have to park on the street most of the time and the car is bright orange. I learned due to gentrification there is a huge anti-tech sentiment here akin to San Francisco. I've bought a camera and switched up my insurance but that doesn't help for the damage already done. What on Earth could I do to prevent this from happening again? Is it safe to leave it at public charging ports? What if they do something worse like snapping the charge port while unattended?"
