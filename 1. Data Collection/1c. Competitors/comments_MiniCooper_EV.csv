The quotes 0-100 (or 0-60) was sandbagger by MINI with everyone from Bjorn to drive getting significantly faster (around 6.6s). Is the new one sandbagged - I think not based on the E getting the same result from a much heavier car. Secondly, I would love to know what 10/10s driving style is. If I am only managing to drive at 8/10, in my MINI SE, then 10/10 would be scary. Maybe it is the track tyres, maybe the warmer weather, but I have never driven a car that hangs on anywhere near as well.

2024-05-09T23:40:32Z,@sleekitwan,Qkut9gFNabI,"I agree with others, the whole character of the Mini has all but evaporated.  I feel a little like, since BMW were gifted the single valuable bit of Rover group they wanted - jilting Honda unpleasantly in the process - it‚Äôs like they‚Äôve gradually been ‚Äòprocessing‚Äô what was a very natural, organic product.  Here we are, well over 2 decades on, and it‚Äôs lost almost all its flavour.  Just imho.  I mean, who knows what Honda would have done, but this is literally a Mini in name only.  Maybe that works, for some people.  I don‚Äôt disparage electric cars in general, not being a fan of changing gears when the car can do it for me, they have a natural advantage to me.  I only know this: if EVs were the norm since 1950 say, to present-day, nobody would be able to convince a boardroom to buy or drive an ICE design.  It‚Äôs inconceivable, due to the environmental catastrophe alone.  But, noise, invisible toxins, etc etc, that‚Äôd blow it out the water anyway.  And that, is with today‚Äôs rather wimpish batteries.  

Breakthrough or not, the batteries are slowly improving anyway.  It‚Äôs where we‚Äôre headed, I think the war is already over, won & lost, but during the transition, I have no beef with other motive power units, and don‚Äôt think ordinary people ought to be punished financially for keeping their purchased vehicle for a decent length of time.  I drive an old Prius, and previously did indeed scoff.  I literally bought it based on just two main parameters: One, it cannot have the same lousy fragile automatic transmission, all the other used cars I bought have;  Two, I cannot afford enough battery power to make the car get really hot inside the cabin, after a cold or wet winter‚Äôs walk in the hills.  Those two things, swung the purchase.  EVs overcome the first also, but are squarely a problem for the second because nothing is much better as a boiler than a diesel or petrol/gas combustion engine.  A great boiler is 93% efficient, and any old ICE is 80% efficient as a heat producer.  We tend to forget only 20% gets anywhere near turning a shaft.  Take care all.",2024-05-09T23:40:32Z

There are plenty of us that don‚Äôt need or want electric cars with bigger batteries and therefore more range. It‚Äôs like reviewing a Lamborghini and saying the interior is pathetic as it doesn‚Äôt fit a family of 5 and 2 dogs. I‚Äôd love to see more smaller electric cars with smaller batteries but with quicker charging. If this new Cooper SE had a 30kw battery but charged at 150kW you could get 10-80% in around 10mins. That wouldn‚Äôt be an issue for long trips (if you ever take long trips) if you only had to stop for 10 minutes every 2 hours. Think outside the box. Cheaper. Lighter. Smaller.

2024-05-08T00:20:30Z,@PilliCooper,Qkut9gFNabI,"Many years of experience with Mini cars and as a Cooper SE 2023 owner, here's my comments and pros-cons list.
I will have to start with negatives because fairly, they ruined the iconic-retro design of their own. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the British market received numerous ""special editions"" of the Mini, which shifted the car from a mass-market item into a fashionable icon because of the Retro design understanding. And since the day Mini came out with new Countryman and the new Mini S/SE. Even the 2023 Mini cooper SE has the characteristic tounches everywhere exterior and interior! KEEP READƒ∞NG DOWN BELOW. !!!

My objective thoughts and pros-cons list :
Pros:
1- Bigger battery; had to be improved because even cars like peugeot 208e-500e had bigger batteries than the previous generation Mini Cooper SE. 

2- The chassis is lengthened; A longer chassis can provide more spacious interior and increases performance.

3- Growth of mirrors; I think it's counter-design, considering the iconic circular mirrors and iconic design language. However, for someone who is not very tall, larger and rectangular mirrors can be considered functional as they can minimize blind spots.

4- More options on Customization the Mini. Also great to see John Cooper Works exterior body kit so smooth...

5- More horse power means better perfomance! Great to see!

CONS; God! I'm furious and dissapointed the are too many of them! (OBJECTIVELY)
1- The black plastic artch trim has gone? Seriously? Those places especially if you live in cities will get tremendous amounts of small damages from other car doors and small physical contacts. Also where is the iconic design?

2- The taillights? What the hack you guys were thinking? The physical≈ü design had never changed since 1990's and you guys not only changed the shape, also ABOLISHED the Union jack Great Britan flag and instead put a triangular cheap material chinese looking lights.

3- ƒ∞nterior: The new generation automobile industry finds it right to express interior design in the most extreme way possible. But if we look at the cars that have reached the timeless design language. No matter what and what, you will not come across such a disgraceful interior design. The reason? The reason is that everywhere inside is made of a single material and they are trying to look as if it is a brand like Tesla. No my friend, this huge screen does not reflect the 1959 Central Speedo screen. There may be people who like it, but if everything is being completely electronic on a single screen, including the air conditioning controls, the car will be more anti-userfriendly and you will understand how useless it is after using it for a week. Also I don't think anyone has to like this stupidly designed ""futuristic"" steering wheel.

4- Interior buttons used to make you feel like you're in a spaceship or an airplane. This swisting and one-screen-everything buttons are definitely less charismatic than previous Mini's. More cheap material plastics being used and carpets everywhere making it like its only one piece carpet. Love to see and feels of the better quality materials on my Cooper SE! I love them.

I would be happier if I was able to see Mini brand not being gay and try to shine, wanting to be more popular, not following the stupid path started by other brands... if if if if.... Mini used to be Mini but not anymore it looks like. It doesn't feel like it. You also learn from your mistakes. No simplicity = No good.",2024-05-08T00:20:30Z

The original is faster ( quote the official figures and lose all credibility), lighter by over 240Kg, more efficient, better handling, better looking, better made yet this car seems to have the sun shine out its missing tailpipe.

The original will get better than WLTP every day of the week. That is 144 miles r.ange. Personally, range is the most overrated feature of any electric car.

Did you know that MINI apparently had to ease up on the traction control because it was so good people thought the car was slow or under powered? In reality it is faster than the new model.

The aesthetics are terrible In my eye, but I am biased so let's ignore that. Did you know the outgoing model has the same HUD? It isn't a new thing.

So many, in my mind, hideously biased comments about the old car, which is in every metric other than range, better. It was cheaper as well. In Oz it was the same price as the petrol with the same spec.

I have been watching FC for many years and this is the first time I have been angry about a review. The new MINI isn't an improvement, and in most cases worse. Please be honest otherwise it sounds like you have been paid to say things.

For those wondering, I have had an SE for almost 4 years and have also tried the new SE so I know what I am saying. Now I wish MINI well, and this car will no doubt attract a new audience, but it is in no way an improvement.

Charge Cars collapsed into administration on May 31 without a single one of its cars reaching customers. The automotive industry issued renewed pleas for electric car purchase incentives after new figures showed a decline in the vehicles' market share. Some 15.2% of new cars registered in March were pure electrics, down from 16.2% during the same month last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The survey of over 300,000 vehicles found electric models suffer 79% more maintenance problems than gas-powered cars. Meanwhile, plug-in hybrids fared even worse  with a concerning 146% more issues reported by drivers. 

Volvo XC40 catches fire and a child was rescued in a recent fire involving a brand new Volvo XC40 hybrid and raises concerns about electric car safety. The driver, who just received the car, managed to rescue his granddaughter before it exploded In a daring rescue, a motorist sustained severe burns pulling his 19-month-old granddaughter from the back seat as his brand-new hybrid car went up in flames and exploded. Seeing smoke, David Butler, a retired engineer at 67, sprang into action. His wife Anne, also 67, had turned back to witness the horror. The rear seat, where their toddler sat in a baby seat, was engulfed in flames, intense ""as if someone had poured petrol on a barbecue."" With a screeching halt, Butler scrambled to reach his granddaughter, Lilly. Much to his chagrin, the rear door of their Volvo XC40, which could run on both gasoline and electric power, refused to budge.Undeterred by the smoke and flames, he clambered back into the front seat and, with a determined reach, managed to unbuckle and free his granddaughter. ""Fortunately, I managed to feel for the seat release and dragged her out of the car,"" he said in a¬†Facebook post. ""As I did this, the hybrid battery exploded, igniting the fuel tank and filling the car with flames. I managed to get out but was on fire,"" he added. Road maintenance workers joined Butler in pulling his granddaughter to safety. He was rushed to the hospital with severe burns covering 60 percent of his body. Lilly, too, required medical attention.

A combustion engined mini can do long distance, the battery cannot. The petrochemical fuel cel dimensions and efficiency, based on the chassis size and battery that can be fitted, will always be an issue. If you can only afford ONE car, the MG4, is a good example. When theses EV's trickle down to the used marketplace, people have one choice as their only car. 70 miles an hour for 3 hours on a UK motorway, at 3.5kW/mile = 60kW battery. This is a benchmark for many people who do the longer trips on a holiday to the lakes, cotswolds, Cornwall, Scotland, Norfolk  (vis-a-vis). Depreciation will get people into better cars for sure - my 71 plate Zoe cost ¬£36k. I have one year of my PCP remaining and autotrader prices are ¬£10k - so trade-in will be lower, meaning we will just walk away and leave the car, requiring us to look again at other transport solutions - I'm thinking an older classic that is ULEZ free seen as EV's will now have to pay the congestion charge anyway....",2024-07-17T07:53:27Z

Otherwise all of the adjectives he has used to describe the new Mini-E can be applied to the old. I disagree with his perspective that because the old Mini-E was basically a petro conversion, that that somehow delegitimized it as a good if not great EV.

The first example he gave was ""the fit and finish was just so good"" -- well, the old Mini-E had that, too, so next? Pleasure to drive -- old Mini-E had that as well. Head up display? Well had Mini NOT copied Tesla, with a forward instrument cluster like the old Mini-E the new Mini-E would need not have to bother with a head-up display. Center display? Mini heritage had been no-nonsense instrumentation -- what does putting picture of kids, dog or cat have to do with driving? So most of the ""improvements"" IMHO were simply gimmicks that do not a great EV make.

Sorry but this argument: ""150miles is enough for everything"" doesn't work in each case. In the winter it is more Iike 100-120miles and after some years you start to pray that you will arrive. I have to drive often 450 miles per day to get to my clients at locations, where you can search for chargers. I own a little Skoda Fabia that takes under 4.5l/100km and it's just convinied. There are no chargers within a kilometer around my flat, so these cars aren't for everyone. To make these a real replacement, they have to go at least real 400 miles per charge but than the CO2 foodprint of the battery gets to bad. You maybe don't like to hear it, but those little 1l three cylinder engines are so efficent and low in costs, that it's not easy to get to the point, where the EV takes over in CO2 and costs. Look at something like the Corsa with it's 1.2l engine and it runs under 4l/100km
We should be a little bit more realistic that there is still a need for ICE powerd cars. No one needs big SUVs with 6l engines, but these small hatchbacks with a little 1L engine, they're not that easy to beat.",2024-07-16T20:00:38Z

I'm not a fan of either the front end (it's looking like a lexus) and especially the backend (which no longer looks like a MINI). And the back turn lights point in the wrong direction again!

2024-07-16T13:04:51Z,@lackoliver55,iUzFs6GEU9c,"Can't speak for the Euro market, but here in the States there's a well known issue with pricing. EVs initially had some tax incentives for being ""green"" (varies by state). But they were higher priced as a new technology, high cost of manufacturing, expensive batteries etc. Then state governments realized they were loosing a decent bit of bag from taxes at the fuel pump.

Fast forward a few years, and now manufacturing is a bit more dialed in, battery tech has become more efficient and pricing for batteries has gone down. But the governments imposed sly tax slaps on EV's to recover the revenue lost from fuel purchases. Ironically, the standard half ton pick-up (i.e. Ford F150, Chevy Silverado 1500 etc.) have become one of the most popular vehicles here, and price to power/price to weight of material sold is quite low (relative to modern pricing. Some of these top model trucks/SUVs go beyond $100k which is ludicrous) 

Depending on the state, there is a bit of a tax incentive on makers/dealers to sell vehicles below 25 mph because it increases fuel sales. Add-on that in many agricultural states (I live in Florida, for example) these standard pick-ups are categorized as a tool to assist in agricultural economy and are then incentivized even more. They are also socially/ideologically considered safer, so insurance is often less, and these models are popular so parts are readily available. etc. etc. etc.

Never owned an EV. The areas I live in are not perfectly fit for it in my use case. So I am not sure what taxes are put on electricity purchases at charging stations. I would imagine it's still a commodity when used as vehicle power. But maybe it's considered a utility purchase? I don't see why they wouldn't be able to tax charging stations like fuel pumps to at least make the vehicle value more appealing.",2024-07-16T13:04:51Z

Are big touch screens kind of cool? Sure. Are the an awful primary way to control the car? Also yes. This doesn't look quite as egregious as your Tesla for instance. Overall, a car I wouldn't mind owning tbh. At least it has two doors, so the doors don't have to be 30 cm long - these open properly and you have oodles of space to get in and out.

BUT.. the cost of the MINI has jumped from the low ¬£20k's at launch to the mid ¬£30k's and to replace my 2021 model with the new MINI would cost ¬£35k for an equivalent model. 
I used to own a 2016 MINI Cooper and wanted a similar five door electric (back in 2021). I was hoping this time, MINI would correct their error of omitting a five door option from the electric range (while still offering it in petrol?), but they didn't. The Aceman is a Countryman light, not a Cooper - and frankly looks awful. So I bought a Volvo EX30, which has five doors, is faster (nice but not critical) has Over the Air Updates (don't want to spend a day at the garage for a 20 min firmware update like I did with the old MINI), is only slightly bigger than the MINI, has a similar ride (but much better suspension) and costs less.
IMO as a MINI fan and EV owner, MINI need to add a five door Cooper and drop the price or up the range (one or the other) as the current options are poor value, when compared to Smart #1/#3, Volvo EX30, MG4, the soon to arrive Renault 5 and now the prices have dropped, Corsa E and Fiat 500e. 
The same was true of the Honda E. Great car at ¬£8k-¬£10k less, but just too expensive for what was offered.

it isnt a case of inadequate charging infrastructure, more a case of always needing to be conscious of where you need to stop next; and a short range also means those out-of-range trips are going to cost a lot more; home charging is so much cheaper than using even the cheapest Rapid charger.

I occasionally do a run to Heathrow (through the Cotswolds = ~120 miles); a 100% home charge costs me ~¬£3 for my remaining 26.1KWh of battery, then I need 3x 20-80% rapid charges along the way, that cost me ~¬£33+; if I had the newer version of my car, I could JUST make the trip on my initial charge - which would cost me ~¬£10.",2024-07-16T11:16:15Z

The joys of getting older!  But if you cannot do 150 miles on a motorway in a lot less than 3 hours (roadworks permitting!) then I suggest Bobby you are no longer particularly safe on motorways.

I suspect the range is actually closer to 190 miles in urban environments (under 4m/kw) but 150 miles on motorway at normal motorway speeds sounds about right.  But the Mini is not intended as a motorway cruiser, merely a city car so for that the range is fine.

You got to consider the Mini factor, about 100miles is about 90miles once you've really booted it! I loved my 'old' Mini Electric but with a fatal flaw of 90miles range, it really wasn't usable even for motorway commuting as you can't guarantee the destination would have charging and public charging is so costly anyway. I suspect with the newest mini ev, the range of approx 150miles would drop to around 130miles once you had abit of fun in it! Still not a usable range in my opinion, I think 200miles is an optimum range in the UK to get from A-B and back again without getting stung by public charging, which in some cases is more expensive than fuel... I think it should really be used to top up. I found myself regularly charging near empty at public chargers. I've gone back to petrol. But in the hope that public leccy will get less expensive and when EV's come down in price with an effective range of around 200miles :)",2024-07-16T10:11:41Z

Realistically, if you want to follow the advice about not charging beyond 80% and aren‚Äôt foolhardy enough to go below 10%, realistic range is about 70% of what you could get driving from 100% to 0%. That makes 400km more like 280km and then subtract a bit from that for adverse conditions/freeway driving and it‚Äôs probably closer to 220km - but that‚Äôs the maximum I‚Äôd do in 2 hours driving and I‚Äôll usually stop for half an hour anyway after 2 hours driving - so the SE makes sense over the E.",2024-07-04T08:07:29Z

This time of year the 140mile range is usual. 
It is by far the best frame for an EV. It's like a go kart. It beats the JCW mini around a test track on a video due to its acceleration and linear power delivery (no gears to change means no loss of power on acceleration). 
It's a really cool fun car packed with tech. The L3 is the top spec, but you get plenty of toys for that. The L1,L2 and L3 have the same power etc.",2022-04-24T17:53:48Z

2021-01-20T08:41:37Z,@js-hl5hv,4dnbnQI-P_E,"OK, so I have had my MINI for about 4 months and I can now see how Rory only got 98 miles. First thing is never, trust the range. Second,. never trust the range (technically only one point, but it was so important I thought I'd mention it twice - ok so I am a Red Dwarf fan). You have 20ish miles *after* the range gets to 0. Check out carwow's range test to see for yourself. Secondly, to get the actual battery percentage, you need to use the trip computer. When the segments go down, it is about 7% higher (eg. at a displayed 4 bars, or 50%, you could actually be at 57-58%). I regularly get 140-155 miles (depending on driving style) from a charge. This is in normal mode with aircon on. Take off a bit for the cold weather, as EVs don't like the cold and there you have it. 98 Miles becomes 125-130 miles *actual* range. About 10% down on my range due to the temperature. It was worrying me how anybody could only get 100miles per charge - believe me I tried once to get down to 100 miles, and failed dismally.

Even if it made the 145 mile range they claim that still wouldn't be very good given that similar priced competitors like the Peugeot e208 and VW ID.3 have ranges over 200 miles. The Mini-E has a 32.6 kWh battery compared to the 50 kWh and 49 kWh of the Peugeot and the VW and I think presenting the fact that you can charge it faster (because there's less to charge) as a positive point is daft.,2020-04-20T17:23:55Z

The Hyundai Ioniq had a 28kWh battery and could charge with 75kW DC. That means the battery is capable to charge with almost 3C peak. The Mini barely makes 1.5C so in comparison it charges slower than the old Ioniq.
Battery size and quick charging are 2 different things. What's important for EV buyers is to know how many miles you can charge up in a set amount of time. That's why if you have an efficient car that can charge fast, you'll get more miles in a set amount of time while still having a smaller battery that allows for better efficiency (Ioniq for example).",2020-04-19T07:46:24Z

You could tow a trailer with 10MWh of batteries (obviously not in the real world), and go 40,000 miles between charges, however it wouldn't handle, accelerate or be in any way fun to drive. The range, and I mean real range not the overly reported 100mile thing, is more than adequate for virtually all use cases. You will rarely be more than 100 miles from the nearest charger, so although annoying, you can still make road trips. For a city car, you get another 150 city miles each morning (yes, the real range) when you charge. Not many people's commute is that long I would guess. The trade off is that you will be driving the most fun EV available until you add another 0 to the end of the price. That is a trade off I am willing to take.

Historically, with maximum regeneration on the brakes, electric cars do better in towns and cities. This is due to the need to start and stop and brake more regularly, (thus generating more electric current from the brakes). I would love to see how many laps of a real track these cars can do. With the constant need for acceleration and intense braking, it should really put an electric car to the test.",2020-03-23T17:29:38Z

2020-12-07T02:09:12Z,@js-hl5hv,4dnbnQI-P_E,"@James Stewart There is a sweet spot for range. Too slow, and accessories (heater/aircon etc) start to be the major drain. Too fast, and air friction takes over. Power required for air friction is proportional to speed cubed, so going at 30mph will need 8 times less power than going at 60mph - but you get there twice as quickly. However, you will use twice as much energy for the accessories when going the same distance (because it takes twice as long). Energy lost to rolling resistance is approximately constant over a given distance. Regen helps, but you only get back a percentage of the energy - but that is infinitely more than ICE cars get :) In a warmer country, where the aircon is on all the time, I average about 250km (155miles) of total range (based on recharging at about 200km/125 miles and around 20% battery left).",2023-11-16T14:35:58Z

2020-03-22T17:43:39Z,@mtlsi,4dnbnQI-P_E,"@@AutoTraderTV Thx for your answer, but I have a comment. Mini is and was a fun car to drive, this is its USP against other smaller cars. So this so called real world test is a joke. You should be driving it in at least Normal if not in Sport. Who would buy a Mini and then use it in Green Plus? If they can get a cheaper electric car with longer range and drive it as a grandpa :). Or completelly hammer it and having more fun than in a Mini in Green Plus... Because they could do it since the range is longer and even without freezing :). 

Anyway, I like that you did this test and have shown that Mini has really, really, really short range, maybe next time first try to get into the shoes of a potential buyer and plan a test according to him. Such a test would probably be just ok for a buyer of for example Renault Zoe, who does not care for a joy in driving and his primary target is a cheap drive from A to B ;).

Sadly I agree with your last part, that is why I do watch majority of test only as entertainment. There are only a few on YouTube that directly state negative issues with the cars (and yes, the thing that rear window does not wind down fully was a bulshit negative already in 2000 when majority of cars got AC and not in 2020:)), majority of them are independant from car industry, that is why they can do an honest review.",2020-03-22T17:57:44Z

It's really 29kWH (ish), a standard leaf is 32.6kWH.
Might also be worth mentioning the charge rate it can handle topping it up, capacity isn't the only consideration as to it being quick to charge.
Nissan Leaf E+ can handle 100kWh.

They kept saying soon 2020 and this is all they can come up with a small 90 to a possible 100 if you don't run any of the heating and cooling system.  BMW should be ashamed of this offering. Idu why they don't do a skateboard design for the battery pack (instead of cramming everything under the backseat) an add a 60watt battery. I'd like to see BMW do that in a Mini Cooper Countryman ALL4 as all electric. I'll buy one just compete with the Chevy Bolt and Model 3 BMW/ MINI just compete with the range 259-300.,2020-05-22T05:21:56Z

2020-07-10T23:16:44Z,@kaya051285,4dnbnQI-P_E,"@@MsKewi-NYC It's not that simple. If you want to double the range the additional batteries would add about 220kg and required 100 litres of space. The heavier mass would make the car even less efficient and require stronger suspension and frame. Not to mention the additional cost of all of this

I'm happy with EVs with a real world range of 100 miles. Do I want more, yes but not if it costs significantly more. What's more important than range is the price point needs to fall for EVs

I'd much rather see car manufacturers offer mobile batteries we can rent. A 50KWh pack on wheels you collect and tow at the rear of the car which gives an additional 200 miles range for the few times you do more than 100 miles a day

A car like this would work fine for many people. I will soon be doing 17,000 miles a year",2020-07-10T23:16:44Z

Bjorn Nyland tested the mini and had a range of 163 km at a constant 120kph on the freeway. This is the worst possible scenario for any EV, and it is still more than 90/98 miles. Around the city (it is a city car) the range is more like 150 miles (that is what I am getting currently, so it isn't a guess). Oh, I also use the aircon and have the radio going (quite loudly). The only realistic way to get near that range is to only drive at 60mph on back roads, and power out of every corner, just like a car reviewer would do :)",2020-10-14T00:23:39Z

No, No, NO NO! Stop repeating this talking point promoted by makers of cars with small batteries. Those 36 minutes of charging only add an optimistic 115 miles of range to this Mini. Another small EV that gains, say, 160 miles of range in 36 minutes of charging is obviously BETTER IN EVERY WAY than this Mini, even if when you unplug it's only at 60% charge. (I think the Citro√´n √´-C3 would achieve that.)

Why do you refuel/recharge a car? To get where you want to go. Nobody is holding a gun to your head forcing you keep charging until the EV reaches 80% charge. The Mini driver who feels superior because they hit 80% faster than another small EV will eventually realize they have to recharge again 45 miles before the other driver.

For the 1,000th time, time to charge to 80 or 100% is NOT an important metric. What matters is how long you spend charging to add a given amount of miles. That's a graph, not a sound bite, but there's no excuse for focusing on the wrong thing.",2024-07-16T20:30:20Z

2024-05-08T05:13:54Z,@medman36,RAtwyLFvmcc,"Lovely lively video, to start with. I think they did a decent job of keeping the character of the mini. Ot looks ""healthier"" than previous itterations of the ice minis I've seen on the road. Although perhaps stylish and characterful, Buildwise to me, they still look fragile and anaemic on the outside.
Interior wise I'm not sold on the design and aesthetics. I do like the originality of the round screen. That is definitely different and refreshing even compared to the competition and Tesla. I'm not sold on the sounds and will likely turn it off most of the time. If sound cancellation was part of the audio package I would consider it.
One pedal driving looks good on first impression, it even has full stop feom what Ingather from this video. What I have noticed recently where this mini and other EVs go wrong in my view is that the rear space and boot space is too much of an after thought and then to me this mini version and its value is quickly lost. I don't think for the specs and total package this cooper is valued correctly and price wise. I would value it no more than 20000 euros max. To me more thought could have been put into improving the rear passenger seating area and provide a far better sliding or folding bench configuration to let the owner choose seating position for more legroom or more flush bootspace design. Most journeys are without occupants and I use the rear seating area mainly for storage. It is only an odd occasion I transport people in the back these days. I think most electric cars can use a more playful compromising design of a transforming rear bench seat that can move around front to back on sliders or a near flush origami folding of rear bench or seats to accomodate a more non sound reverbing rear boot space. I think that would accomodate a more fitting multifunctional use of the rear bench sitting area/space in the 21st century. Ideas, for example, the id2all and idbuzz, are putting forward. And I have not heard anything about V2L or V2H/G support for this mini, which is a missed opportunity for future proofing this EV.",2024-05-08T05:13:54Z

The battery and range are fine for me most of the time, and besides I do not want to spend a lot on Li-Ion while it seems batteries are going to improve so much.

2024-05-08T00:25:11Z,@PilliCooper,RAtwyLFvmcc,"Many years of experience with Mini cars and as a Cooper SE 2023 owner, here's my comments and pros-cons list.
I will have to start with negatives because fairly, they ruined the iconic-retro design of their own. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the British market received numerous ""special editions"" of the Mini, which shifted the car from a mass-market item into a fashionable icon because of the Retro design understanding. And since the day Mini came out with new Countryman and the new Mini S/SE. Even the 2023 Mini cooper SE has the characteristic tounches everywhere exterior and interior! KEEP READƒ∞NG DOWN BELOW. !!!

My objective thoughts and pros-cons list :
Pros:
1- Bigger battery; had to be improved because even cars like peugeot 208e-500e had bigger batteries than the previous generation Mini Cooper SE. 

2- The chassis is lengthened; A longer chassis can provide more spacious interior and increases performance.

3- Growth of mirrors; I think it's counter-design, considering the iconic circular mirrors and iconic design language. However, for someone who is not very tall, larger and rectangular mirrors can be considered functional as they can minimize blind spots.

4- More options on Customization the Mini. Also great to see John Cooper Works exterior body kit so smooth...

5- More horse power means better perfomance! Great to see!

CONS; God! I'm furious and dissapointed the are too many of them! (OBJECTIVELY)
1- The black plastic artch trim has gone? Seriously? Those places especially if you live in cities will get tremendous amounts of small damages from other car doors and small physical contacts. Also where is the iconic design?

2- The taillights? What the hack you guys were thinking? The physical≈ü design had never changed since 1990's and you guys not only changed the shape, also ABOLISHED the Union jack Great Britan flag and instead put a triangular cheap material chinese looking lights.

3- ƒ∞nterior: The new generation automobile industry finds it right to express interior design in the most extreme way possible. But if we look at the cars that have reached the timeless design language. No matter what and what, you will not come across such a disgraceful interior design. The reason? The reason is that everywhere inside is made of a single material and they are trying to look as if it is a brand like Tesla. No my friend, this huge screen does not reflect the 1959 Central Speedo screen. There may be people who like it, but if everything is being completely electronic on a single screen, including the air conditioning controls, the car will be more anti-userfriendly and you will understand how useless it is after using it for a week. Also I don't think anyone has to like this stupidly designed ""futuristic"" steering wheel.

4- Interior buttons used to make you feel like you're in a spaceship or an airplane. This swisting and one-screen-everything buttons are definitely less charismatic than previous Mini's. More cheap material plastics being used and carpets everywhere making it like its only one piece carpet. Love to see and feels of the better quality materials on my Cooper SE! I love them.

I would be happier if I was able to see Mini brand not being gay and try to shine, wanting to be more popular, not following the stupid path started by other brands... if if if if.... Mini used to be Mini but not anymore it looks like. It doesn't feel like it. You also learn from your mistakes. No simplicity = No good.",2024-05-08T00:25:11Z

We are certainly moving away from MINI with the Clubbie ordered factory new 21 but my Hatch one of the first F56 on the road on low miles goes on holidays and road trips.

I own the mini 2015 Cooper 4 door S, and I feel like that's the last of its breed and before that had the classic look which is what we buy them for. I'm not looking for a new mini with a whol new look. Like the interior with the bubble screens, bubble mirrors, front and back bubble lights,the push buttons that look like buttons in a plane pit.  Why change these things. Us mini fans are not looking for a new futuristic basic redesigned mini look that starting to look like the gross Teslas...just maybe new functions but keep it classic!

So the videographer has to use a longer lens from further away to flatten the image, but that obviously requires the door to be open.
