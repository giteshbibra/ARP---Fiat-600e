... the one that broke down 4 times with brake/electrical issues? Each time matt had to sit outside the car for 5-20 minutes by the roadside till the car reset itself before he could drive it again.

I mean, heck, IF they had awarded this Jeep all these awards, and then found out that an engine component regularly 'Lunched' the motor, or another compnent necessitated the MASS RECALL of the car (be it safety or whatever) a number of months later? Well... Certainly an 'Egg on faces' moment eh? üòè.
You WOULDN'T give a crap tonne of awards to a movie say BEFORE it was released to the audiences would you? It could VERY WELL flop BIG STYLE (well, as is common these days).
To me, 'Car of the year' awards (and the magazines that give them), are just MORONIC, it's all just a scam and nothing more! I prefer to read reviews on what has been out at least a year to get the TRUE sense of what cars (or whatever I personally am looking to buy) to learn and understand WHAT EXACTLY IS...

1. the M/KWH, 
2. the range and 
3. the price. 

This video for example waits to be half way through to casually mention the vehicle ""is a 40 grand car""
I'm sure I don't speak for a small percentage of your audience when I say these are the most important factors that ALL ELSE hang on. We may well still watch the video (who knows we might win the lotto and now all the other stuff is relevant :-) But I'd rather know up front that; everything you are about to hear only exists in fantasy land (because you can't afford it) - rather than entertain the idea that the car is attainable only to be shattered after watching (or half watching) the video. 

And as a post script - you get three quarters of the way through to find out it's an electric build over an ICE car so there is less space!  For those of us really looking to try our best to get into electric car ownership we need a slimmed down version of these kinds of reviews so we can save time. Having watched this video I now know I would never buy this car even if I had the money so in that sense it has served it's purpose. But I think if I'd had the relevant info right at the start I could have come to that conclusion within 1 minute instead of 19.",2023-10-26T02:13:20Z

I agree also with the notion that some car features don't get properly scrutinised before going into production. Cars have been around long enough to get the basics right and even though new features pop up from time to time - cup holders for example - surely there is no need to re-invent anything just for the sake of it.
I've just started a list of things that I like but aren't yet universal even though it is a no brainer to have them. The drive selector should be as found in the BMW i3 and now in VW IDs too. No arguments, that is just how it should be! Sunglasses holder. Still not universal and yet so useful. A glove box that you might be able to fit more than a pair of gloves in (at least it should have some room left after putting the handbook in there). A spare wheel or a space saver at the minimum. This should be top of the list, don't know why I left it so long. Front storage. Even a front wheel drive multi platform car like this should be able to find room for charging cables but more room would be appreciated for emergency items and/or muddy boots. Rear wheel drive. Not only does it make for a better balanced drive with no real downsides (I got through many severe winters with RWD, just put a bag of sand in the boot, it puts a bit more weight over the drive wheels and could be good for sprinkling on the road too). The upsides are many, the driving feel and balance already mentioned, bigger front storage, tighter turning circle, less spinning of the front wheels especially in EVs and therefore quicker and safer getaways. I love the driver display in the VW ID3 that moves with the steering wheel - genius. Real buttons and knobs. I know that Teslas system works well but that is the exception that proves the rule. If your not 110% confident that your software is well designed and responds instantly, don't risk ruining your car, just fit real buttons, and not haptic ones either. Finally, put efficiency higher on the list of development goals. Too many manufacturers make their cars only as aerodynamic or light as they feel they can get away with. It is such a desirable quality to have an efficient car, it's a marketable feature.",2023-10-25T19:10:41Z

2023-10-24T19:51:31Z,@EliotHochberg,YxpaKrbA-b4,"A little dubious about the assertion that it's the batteries that make non-Chinese vehicles more expensive.

Instead, I think there are better causes we can identify:

1) Labor - every other item that is made in China vs. any western country is cheaper because of cheap labor. 

2) Subsidization - the CCP has identified, for whatever reason, that making EVs is good for China and their export market, and have adjusted their industrialization accordingly.

3) Sharing tech across companies - this one I have less evidence of, but it seems reasonable that, the way Chinese businesses operate, there is a lot more tech sharing than in western ""capitalist"" countries. Yes, Chinese companies compete with each other, but their intellectual property laws are a lot more lax than in the west. As a result, western companies have a lot more expenses reinventing the wheel, so to speak, with EV drivetrains.

4) Yes, the batteries may be less expensive, but for a different reason: I'm willing to wager that the materials that make up Chinese batteries cost those companies less.

5) And then, on the fault of the west's side, EVs are competing more with existing ICE sales. When a consumer doesn't have an ICE vehicle to choose from, they are going to get an EV. In China, while there are plenty of ICE vehicles, most of their OEMs are pure EV plays. Thus, they aren't comparing the cost of the EV development and sales with ICE vehicles. Western OEMs are investing in two or more powertrain lines, and so they divide up their revenue accordingly. This makes EV development appear more costly vs sales.",2023-10-24T19:51:31Z

Then pack chemistry is important, e.g. NMC Li NiMnCo are more energy dense and by this fact, have the potential to have a greater range. Plus, due to their valued constituent materials, there‚Äôs a high likelihood of the pack being recycled at its eventual end of life. Thermal runaway occurs at 220¬∞C/104.44¬∞F; which can be caused by puncturing the battery. Their C-rating/charge-discharge cycle life is 500 to 2,000 80% discharges.

Whereas LFP Lithium Iron-phosphate LiFePO4, are heavier than NMC but less energy-dense and thus have less potential range, (especially in cold temps.) than packs with cobalt. And due to less valued chemistry, LFP packs are less likely to be recycled. Thermal runway occurs at 270¬∞C/518¬∞F; LFP batteries can withstand puncture without going into immediate thermal runaway.

If you go straight from power to regen, you are sacrificing energy to the inefficiency of the motor twice, so you do not get back what you used. Around town, one pedal driving is nice and easy, but for efficiency, what I want is at least the option to coast on lift off, but have regeneration triggered by the brake pedal, only bringing in the friction brakes when the motor can't slow you fast enough (and in contrast to the muttering rotters, I would like a nice, clear change in pedal feel at that point, so that I can learn how much I can slow without bringing the friction brakes in).

It is possible that my sense of better depth perception is all psychological, and really it's just my dumb monkey-brain feeling _""Big thing above me = scary. Small thing below me = fine.""_

But that doesn't seem to add up to me. Like obviously whenever anyone wants to position their vehicle accurately, they look at the ground to triangulate. When you're finely judging the distance to the vehicle in front, you look at the back wheels or bumper. When you're parking in a tight space, you might tilt the mirrors down to see the wheels and bumpers relative to the ground.

Maybe there are other nuances or factors I haven't considered. I'm always up for being convinced by empirical evidence that my perception of the world is completely distorted.

And they require that it has to be turned back on every time you restart the car. Jeep have been clever, because the button opens the screen where you can turn it off, so 2 presses required and 5* rating preserved. 

The Nissan Ariya has got LKA right, though. You can set your own preference for both sensitivity and intrusiveness. On the lowest level of intrusiveness, it doesn't yank the wheel at all, just makes it vibrate. So it won't cause an accident, but it might still help prevent one, as it is supposed to. And the best bit is, those settings can be chosen once, and they'll be retained, unlike turning it off altogether.",2023-10-24T21:56:54Z

Then there‚Äôs pay for optional extras for LED front lights, LED rear lights, heated seats, rubber mats including that flippy cover, front fog lights and the lists go on.

2023-10-25T15:33:31Z,@phelanwolf6747,YxpaKrbA-b4,"""Reliability"" is not actually reliability. It is true that for instance French and Italian car brands are not known for ""reliability"" but for their cheap price and low upkeep costs.
On the other hand German brands are also not known for ""reliability"", these are mostly luxury cars requiring high maintenance, thus high upkeep costs.
Japanese car brands are actually known for ""reliability"", like cars running 100.000 km without maintenance and without ANYTHING breaking.
But with EVs where many mechanical components are gone, the ""reliability"" is likely to shift a lot. 
There are different expectations on what reliability means, is the German car ""reliable"" because you spend a lot of time and money to ensure that it operates properly? Or is the Japanese definition more to your expectation of reliability where a car just operates properly for a very long time without you having to spend time and/or money to make sure it is working properly?
It would be easy to say that most people might favor the ""Japanese way"" but in Germany that is not the case, Japanese cars are almost non-existent here even though they dominate many other markets. This is because there are people who define reliability in the sense of the German car example and they want the luxury these cars promise.",2023-10-25T15:33:31Z

2022-12-06T16:14:17Z,@krisw1,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"@@MartinzW I do know that Jeep adopted Android Automotive as its in-car OS across its product range (as ‚ÄúuConnect version 5.x‚Äù).  If this car uses a different OS, it would be the sole exception from Jeep‚Äôs recent launches.

...but Android *Automotive* is not ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù as you understand it. Android Automotive is an operating system that is based on Android, and shares its libraries and services with the Android phone/tablet/TV operating system, and so it is capable of running Android apps. But, unlike Android for phones, car systems that use Android Automotive do not have to include a Play Store or the standard Google App suite as part of the licensing agreement.

2022-11-28T04:44:35Z,@anthonyc8499,VUTk4_ZrkLY,Jeep have done some black magic visual trickery with the Avenger. Vicky keeps saying it's tiny but it looks decently sized. It's unfortunate it's FWD-only and not available in North America. It probably would need to have 240mi of EPA range to be viable in the USA.,2022-11-28T04:44:35Z
2022-11-28T19:53:58Z,@EM.1.,VUTk4_ZrkLY,They have an AWD model for this model as an EV. This would be perfect if it had more range for the US.,2022-11-28T19:53:58Z
2022-11-29T06:20:43Z,@MichaelSmith-kr9qw,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"Yeah I wish they would've brought it to the states it would be perfect for my wife who commutes about 3 miles to and from work every day. Our Renegade is FWD and to be honest I was skeptical about it at first but 5 years of solid service and 4 Snow Storms later I am not talk feet of snow but 2 of them were 9"" deep and it did amazingly well haven't got it stuck yet. Now the 2023 Renegades are all 4x4 and they've tamed down the color palate as well. But the new dash and Infotainment. Few more payments left then I might go snag a TH Renegade and have some fun build a small overlanding rig for my wife and I !!!",2022-11-29T06:20:43Z

I‚Äôve gotta be honest, I would‚Äôve liked to have seen a lot less Vicky and a lot more car in this review. Not just because I didn‚Äôt see much of the interior, but because she makes me feel anxious - There was no smiling, joking or any witty comments. Just non stop talking, but in a way that made her come across as she doesn‚Äôt like her job.

I couldn‚Äôt find Matt from Carwow anywhere online for a review of this car. He‚Äôs got great charisma.",2022-11-29T13:22:52Z

I agree to many brands thinking bigger is better and not spending time or money on developing smaller models in their ranges. Not everyone wants or needs a giant SUV that can carry 7 6ft people and drive 500miles at a time. Another great review Vicki üëè",2022-11-28T00:16:21Z
