thomas shelby in birmingham the home\\u00a0\\nof peaky blinders with the cheeky cento blinder\\u00a0\\u00a0 i did say that and that's the reason why i'm\\u00a0\\ndressed as such a turn-of-the-century fashionista\\u00a0\\u00a0 but the thing is is i couldn't drive this in\\u00a0\\nitaly so i brought it to birmingham because\\u00a0\\u00a0 this particular part of birmingham back in the\\u00a0\\n1800s was known as the italian quarter little\\u00a0\\u00a0 italy where a lot of italian immigrants came and\\u00a0\\nof course piggy blinders is filmed and set here\\u00a0\\u00a0 and the shelby family the peaky blinders were a\\u00a0\\nreal gangster family but before i go into all that\\u00a0\\u00a0 this is the bit that we need to talk about this\\u00a0\\nis a ground-up new car and it's ever so slightly\\u00a0\\u00a0 bigger in all respects than the old 500 and it's\\u00a0\\ngoing to be made in turin in italy whereas before\\u00a0\\u00a0 it was made in poland but is it any good i'm\\u00a0\\njohnny smith welcome to the late break show\\u00a0\\u00a0 now i'm going to a couple of areas around the\\u00a0\\ndigbeth region of birmingham and that is because\\u00a0\\u00a0 that's where the italian quarter came to be around\\u00a0\\nthe early part of the 1800s people came across\\u00a0\\u00a0 from northern italy mostly because of napoleonic\\u00a0\\noccupation and famine and they brought with them\\u00a0\\u00a0 skills of being entertainers and um precision\\u00a0\\nworkers engineers late part of the 1800s a lot\\u00a0\\u00a0 of southern italians came and congregated\\u00a0\\nhere and they brought with them things\\u00a0\\u00a0 like organ grinding skills and ice cream\\u00a0\\ni love the fact that fiat has finally made\\u00a0\\u00a0 a 500 electric for a global audience\\u00a0\\nbecause the original one that most people\\u00a0\\u00a0 have never driven came out in 2013 was only\\u00a0\\navailable weirdly in california and oregon\\u00a0\\u00a0 in the states it was made in mexico and sold in\\u00a0\\nthose parts of the states strange very strange\\u00a0\\u00a0 they had about 84 to 87 miles of range type\\u00a0\\none connector so quite old-school so it's 61\\u00a0\\u00a0 millimeters longer 56 millimeters wider and 22\\u00a0\\nmillimeters longer in the wheelbase in other\\u00a0\\u00a0 words there's a chance it might have a bit more\\u00a0\\nroom inside than the previous 500 which is no bad\\u00a0\\u00a0 thing the design is unmistakably 500 but they've\\u00a0\\nmade it a bit more i was going to say brutish\\u00a0\\u00a0 let's just call it less cutesy because it's not\\u00a0\\nexactly a brutal 500 but it's got these kind of\\u00a0\\u00a0 little overlapping eyebrows with kind of a bad boy\\u00a0\\nbonnet if you remember 90s modified cars we used\\u00a0\\u00a0 to do this the bad boy bonnet front wheel drive of\\u00a0\\ncourse this is the first fiat 500 to be available\\u00a0\\u00a0 with 17-inch wheels 17s they look massive on this\\u00a0\\ni've got the convertible version and it will be\\u00a0\\u00a0 available just like the existing 500 as a hard top\\u00a0\\nor a or a convertible but three door only or two\\u00a0\\u00a0 door because it's the convertible this particular\\u00a0\\nshape is only going to be available as electric so\\u00a0\\u00a0 this is going on sale alongside the existing shape\\u00a0\\n500 that's been face lifted an awful lot in its\\u00a0\\u00a0 piston full but when that gets phased out you'll\\u00a0\\nonly be able to buy a 500 as an electric car\\u00a0\\u00a0 right let's have a look under here\\u00a0\\nbecause the fiat 500 e is available in two\\u00a0\\u00a0 flavors of tune the city range and the long\\u00a0\\nrange and the difference really is motor\\u00a0\\u00a0 and battery size the city range is 70 kilowatt\\u00a0\\nmotor and the long range is 87 kilowatt motor\\u00a0\\u00a0 okay which means north to 62 is a bit slower\\u00a0\\nfor the city car nine and a half seconds to 62\\u00a0\\u00a0 versus nine seconds to 62 with the long range\\u00a0\\ntop speed is lower with the city 84 miles an hour\\u00a0\\u00a0 long range 93 miles an hour the battery partner\\u00a0\\nfor this car is samsung and apparently they've got\\u00a0\\u00a0 these interesting modules a first application\\u00a0\\nintegrating calling and additional functions\\u00a0\\u00a0 directly into the modules which allows battery\\u00a0\\npacks to increase in energy density now what\\u00a0\\u00a0 that really means is the fact that they've\\u00a0\\nmanaged to get a nice liquid cool battery pack\\u00a0\\u00a0 into quite a small place it's 42 kilowatt hours\\u00a0\\nif you've bought the long range version and it's\\u00a0\\u00a0 23.7 kilowatt hours if you buy the city version\\u00a0\\nwhat does that mean uh range wise 199 mile range\\u00a0\\u00a0 wltp for the long range and 115 miles range for\\u00a0\\nthe city car this car the car i'm testing today\\u00a0\\u00a0 is the top range car which is la prima there are\\u00a0\\nfour spec levels and we'll talk about the spec\\u00a0\\u00a0 levels in a sec but basically that means this\\u00a0\\nis the long range car with a 42 kilowatt hour\\u00a0\\u00a0 battery pack with 199 mile range capability so\\u00a0\\nwhen you set the sat nav on the electric 500 it\\u00a0\\u00a0 gives you all the charging points it's actually\\u00a0\\nquite a high resolution bigger screen for the um\\u00a0\\u00a0 the top ranking models at this 10.25 inch rather\\u00a0\\nthan seven inch steering on 500 is always light\\u00a0\\u00a0 it's a car geared around city life which is why\\u00a0\\nev makes a lot of sense and although you might\\u00a0\\u00a0 discount the 23.7 kilowatt hour city range version\\u00a0\\nthat does 115 miles actually when you think about\\u00a0\\u00a0 it there's so many of these cars that just live\\u00a0\\nin cities and don't go out beyond the city limits\\u00a0\\u00a0 which makes sense and in city use you can probably\\u00a0\\nget more than 115 miles okay this i think is\\u00a0\\u00a0 faisaly street now back in the days of the italian\\u00a0\\nquarter i'm pretty sure there was no laser quest i'm pretty sure yeah so just like the previous version of the 500\\u00a0\\nthe convertible isn't a true convertible in the\\u00a0\\u00a0 in the traditional sense it still has a metal\\u00a0\\nstructure on the roof it just peels back the\\u00a0\\u00a0 middle section so it'll either go back to there\\u00a0\\non one push or it'll go but down to there on two\\u00a0\\u00a0 pushes what it means is the roof stays bunched\\u00a0\\nup here your rear visibility is quite bad but\\u00a0\\u00a0 it's very stylish so i'd say it's more of a sort\\u00a0\\nof full-length mad sunroof than it is a cabrio\\u00a0\\u00a0 come and have a look inside your cheeky\\u00a0\\ncento blinder i'm going to keep saying that\\u00a0\\u00a0 so you've got a two spoke steering wheel\\u00a0\\nwhich is really similar to the honda e\\u00a0\\u00a0 the 500 badge this can be ordered as a two tone so\\u00a0\\nof course you've got no gear shifter because it's\\u00a0\\u00a0 single speed electric so it just does prnd for\\u00a0\\nthe um the transmission just along the top here\\u00a0\\u00a0 this particular car being the high spec\\u00a0\\nhas the pad for wireless phone charging\\u00a0\\u00a0 just inside this cubby here and it has\\u00a0\\nan embossed outline of the turin skyline\\u00a0\\u00a0 to remind you that this is made in turin and\\u00a0\\ndown here in the door handle grab there's an\\u00a0\\u00a0 embossed picture of a classic fiat 500 i used\\u00a0\\nto have one of those and it says made in torino\\u00a0\\u00a0 and actually quite similar to the honda e\\u00a0\\ncome to think of it is this little plinth\\u00a0\\u00a0 here between the seats you've got an armrest here\\u00a0\\nbut the plinth has your e modes what your e-modes\\u00a0\\u00a0 are is your driving modes and there's three of\\u00a0\\nthem i mean normal which is what it defaults to\\u00a0\\u00a0 if i go to range mode it kind of backs off\\u00a0\\nthe top speed a little bit and it might\\u00a0\\u00a0 back off the air conditioning and stuff but\\u00a0\\nthen you've got a third mode called sherpa\\u00a0\\u00a0 which is like the get me home mode it backs\\u00a0\\noff the top speed completely it won't let you\\u00a0\\u00a0 use the heating or the air con i don't think\\u00a0\\nand it really dumbs down the throttle so that\\u00a0\\u00a0 is like i just want to get home i'm running\\u00a0\\nlow on power i love the fact it's called\\u00a0\\u00a0 sherpa it'll guide you home but the problem is\\u00a0\\ni think of sherpa as a 1970s builders van the\\u00a0\\u00a0 sort of thing you'd see around here in the olden\\u00a0\\ndays not as old as piggy blinders but you know i\\u00a0\\u00a0 don't think they had cards in peaky blenders\\u00a0\\ni know they did so i've got it in normal mode\\u00a0\\u00a0 if i stick it in range mode what i didn't mention\\u00a0\\nbefore the main difference between range mode and\\u00a0\\u00a0 normal mode is you have the same amount of power\\u00a0\\nbut it's one pedal driving so it'll hold it now\\u00a0\\u00a0 and it'll bring it to a complete standstill\\u00a0\\nusing do it by just coming off the throttle\\u00a0\\u00a0 there is no regen that you can dial in dial out\\u00a0\\nit's either range mode or normal mode where it has\\u00a0\\u00a0 very very minor regen braking so i come off the\\u00a0\\nbrake now and it's actually really aggressive\\u00a0\\u00a0 sort of like level three on my kia soul\\u00a0\\nor maximum b on a on an e-goal for example\\u00a0\\u00a0 i think they've done a good job with this\\u00a0\\nyou know it's just good to have a bigger\\u00a0\\u00a0 i hate the term portfolio of city car size you\\u00a0\\nknow this kind of size car that's available\\u00a0\\u00a0 as an electric vehicle and it's interesting it's\\u00a0\\ncharismatic it's got a great selection of textures\\u00a0\\u00a0 and tech this particular one that i'm testing\\u00a0\\ntoday is la prima trim level there's four trim\\u00a0\\u00a0 levels of the 500e action passion icon and laprima\\u00a0\\ni'll put some details on screen of what that means\\u00a0\\u00a0 but basically this is the top one with the\\u00a0\\nconvertible option now on the right hand side\\u00a0\\u00a0 of the steering wheel these buttons here for your\\u00a0\\nlevel two autonomy which is a first in this car\\u00a0\\u00a0 segment and that is lane keep assist or adaptive\\u00a0\\ncruise control and speed limiter there are also\\u00a0\\u00a0 volume controls on the back of the wheel here and\\u00a0\\nyou can change the station so there's buttons on\\u00a0\\u00a0 the front and on the back of the wheel so if i was\\u00a0\\ngoing to buy that the longer range battery pack\\u00a0\\u00a0 which this has it's higher in range capability\\u00a0\\nthan the honda e than the mini and the e up\\u00a0\\u00a0 but i would also urge you to consider the\\u00a0\\nentry level renault zoe the zoe gets overlooked\\u00a0\\u00a0 the zoe's a really good car and with its revised\\u00a0\\ninterior and its tech lift i think it's a very\\u00a0\\u00a0 cool thing it's also exceptionally good value if\\u00a0\\nyou're looking to buy one of these what rivals are\\u00a0\\u00a0 there honda e is probably at the top of the list\\u00a0\\nand the mini e the mini electric and there's a\\u00a0\\u00a0 couple of other little ones to consider as well\\u00a0\\nnow one of the rivals i would pit this against\\u00a0\\u00a0 would be the e up the vw e up or the skoda city\\u00a0\\ngo iv or the um the say at me but you know what\\u00a0\\u00a0 i can't really pit them against that because it\\u00a0\\nseems that you can't really buy it anymore vw\\u00a0\\u00a0 don't necessarily want to sell it to you anymore\\u00a0\\nthey've sort of said they've they've run out of\\u00a0\\u00a0 stock or they're not replenishing stock because\\u00a0\\ni think they're bringing in the vwi d3 and stuff\\u00a0\\u00a0 like that there's a bit it's a bit of a shame\\u00a0\\ni might be wrong there but i would definitely\\u00a0\\u00a0 consider an e up or a um a say at me instead of\\u00a0\\nthis it's got better leg room as back passengers\\u00a0\\u00a0 if that's a thing oh look at that it's a honda crz\\u00a0\\nhybrid i like them dude driving it's got a proper\\u00a0\\u00a0 dodgy roll up on the go windows up smoking too\\u00a0\\nthat's full commitment to the cause if you're\\u00a0\\u00a0 watching this review and you're wondering would i\\u00a0\\nprefer a mini electric or would i prefer a honda e\\u00a0\\u00a0 well i've reviewed those both those cars in quite\\u00a0\\na lot of detail and i'll put the links to them up\\u00a0\\u00a0 here here's the mini one i have to say i really\\u00a0\\nlike this and then here's the honda e one if you\\u00a0\\u00a0 just take it from a style perspective this is\\u00a0\\nthe charge port on the fiat 500e on this side\\u00a0\\u00a0 it has these rubber bungs which are a\\u00a0\\nbit fiddly because they're on long stalks\\u00a0\\u00a0 but it does have a bit of illumination in there\\u00a0\\nand it has ccs which is your dc rapid charge on\\u00a0\\u00a0 the long range it'll charge up to 85 kilowatts\\u00a0\\nwhich is about 35 minutes zero to eighty percent\\u00a0\\u00a0 and on the city range it'll do up to 50 kilowatts\\u00a0\\nwhich is about 30 minutes zero to 80 percent\\u00a0\\u00a0 uh but if you want to do it on like an 11\\u00a0\\nkilowatt wall box two and a half hours for\\u00a0\\u00a0 the city and four hours 15 for the long range even\\u00a0\\nthe convertible has a bigger boot than the honda\\u00a0\\u00a0 e this is 185 liters a honda ease 171 liter boot\\u00a0\\ntension mini e 211 liters and the e up 250 liters\\u00a0\\u00a0 on the renault zoe's massive don't worry about\\u00a0\\nthe noise got some boys doing some digging to bury\\u00a0\\u00a0 a few things you ain't seen me\\u00a0\\nthis is interesting these are\\u00a0\\u00a0 automatic door handles where you just put your\\u00a0\\nhand into this aperture and there's just like a\\u00a0\\u00a0 touch sensitive pad you can yeah and then there's\\u00a0\\na button on the inside here to just press to leave\\u00a0\\u00a0 rather than a physical handle it's neat this is\\u00a0\\nan early car because it's left and drive straight\\u00a0\\u00a0 fresh from italy consignment that i got from\\u00a0\\nitaly all right but watch out for the rival gangs\\u00a0\\u00a0 so you've got your schedules you can schedule your\\u00a0\\ncharging when you want it to be you can set your\\u00a0\\u00a0 charging look like that or you can set your charge\\u00a0\\nyou've got five stages of charging here so you\\u00a0\\u00a0 don't have to charge it to maximum these seats on\\u00a0\\nthe higher ranking cars are really nice there's a\\u00a0\\u00a0 couple of different fabrics to choose from this\\u00a0\\nstuff is called sql sea qual and it uses 20 uh\\u00a0\\u00a0 polyester and plastic fibers that have\\u00a0\\nbeen pulled from and recycled from the sea\\u00a0\\u00a0 i believe they look great i'm a big fan of\\u00a0\\ncloth just like the honda e has a really\\u00a0\\u00a0 interesting kind of tweed in it the 500\\u00a0\\nlooks good with a bit of imaginative tweed\\u00a0\\u00a0 isofix is quite prominent actually really\\u00a0\\nobvious it's not covered up by anything\\u00a0\\u00a0 and there's two isofixes in the back it is a four\\u00a0\\nseat not a five um i'm not going to sit back there\\u00a0\\u00a0 last time i sat in the back of the 500 they had\\u00a0\\nto call for help the cabin's a great place to be\\u00a0\\u00a0 the quality of it's probably not quite as good as\\u00a0\\nthe mini and the the feel of the car it's perhaps\\u00a0\\u00a0 not quite as sharp as a mini cooper se as they\\u00a0\\ncall it the style's i think better than a mini\\u00a0\\u00a0 and the current mini electric is an\\u00a0\\nadaptation of a piston car whereas this isn't\\u00a0\\u00a0 so theoretically this should be a better tool\\u00a0\\nfor the job i'm really enjoying it so far i'm\\u00a0\\u00a0 very much enjoying it would i rather be sat in a\\u00a0\\nhungary the honda e is just one of those damn cars there's only one range version to choose from\\u00a0\\nwhich is disappointing but you still want it\\u00a0\\u00a0 you still want it i keep wanting the honda even\\u00a0\\nthough the range is not great 137 miles at best\\u00a0\\u00a0 i would be really surprised if this car doesn't\\u00a0\\nsell well the most important thing for fiat is to\\u00a0\\u00a0 get bums in seats of existing 500 drivers who are\\u00a0\\nused to driving a non-electric 500 a piston 500\\u00a0\\u00a0 and they want to taste what it's like going\\u00a0\\ninto the world of evie and that's precisely\\u00a0\\u00a0 what i think is vital to broaden\\u00a0\\ntheir kind of appeal of evs yeah that's that's okay it's like a laptop but the\\u00a0\\nturn off just sounds like either a strange circus\\u00a0\\u00a0 fun fare or a sorry ice cream van an italian ice\\u00a0\\ncream bun of course okay fiat 500e where am i at\\u00a0\\u00a0 with it is it a cheeky cento blinder i do actually\\u00a0\\nthink the fca group has done a fantastic job of it\\u00a0\\u00a0 i think it translates to an ev really well\\u00a0\\nyou've got the two battery sizes i think for me\\u00a0\\u00a0 i would want the bigger battery the 42 kilowatt\\u00a0\\nhour which makes it a better range car than the\\u00a0\\u00a0 mini which makes it a better car range than\\u00a0\\nthe honda e but then there's the problem\\u00a0\\u00a0 it's in the danger zone of being priced\\u00a0\\nnear the base model honda e and i think\\u00a0\\u00a0 what a car what a car it's so enjoyable but what\\u00a0\\nthis does i think this will draw a bigger crowd\\u00a0\\u00a0 ultimately and a crowd that maybe wouldn't\\u00a0\\nhave looked at an electric car beforehand\\u00a0\\u00a0 i think it's that right level of\\u00a0\\nsort of quality for the money as well\\u00a0\\u00a0 the mini is a more luxurious feeling car inside\\u00a0\\nand probably a little bit more enjoyable to drive\\u00a0\\u00a0 but the honda e has my attention in terms of\\u00a0\\ndesign overall it's a really difficult verdict\\u00a0\\u00a0 i'm not gonna lie what i would say though\\u00a0\\u00a0 is try this and try the mini and try the handy\\u00a0\\nand look at the zoe as well because they're\\u00a0\\u00a0 all fantastic cars what this ultimately does is\\u00a0\\nexpands the interest in this kind of size of car\\u00a0\\u00a0 as a full ev to a wider market and that's what\\u00a0\\ni want a wider adoption of electric vehicles it's not a very good verdict is it but that's the\\u00a0\\none you're gonna get thanks for watching if you\\u00a0\\u00a0 have already subscribed thanks for subscribing\\u00a0\\nif you're a patreon you subscribe to me through\\u00a0\\u00a0 patreon and pay two or three pounds a month\\u00a0\\nthank you very much for supporting the late\\u00a0\\u00a0 break show hope you've enjoyed it i'm gonna\\u00a0\\nget out of these clothes i feel a bit awkward foreign\",\n          \"[Music] hey guys meet the brand new 2024 Fiat 500e and of course the E stands for electric and if you know anything about the Fiat chin quento you know that it came around in 1957 as a city car and this of course is the latest version in fact Fiat has only built an electric version of the Fiat 500e and in this video we're going to take it for a ride we're going to see how it does in this Miami Heat and traffic and of course we're going to tell you whether you should buy it leas and rent it or forget it so let's hit the [Music] road now you may be wondering what does this little guy compete with and there are two cars that come to mind immediately of course the mini SE uh which is coming back with also ironically 150 miles of range uh and the bolt which is gone but you know who knows so we are coming back to a time of having small electric cars that are oh God I'm going to hate this because you guys are G me so much you know what in the comments dare I say affordable look at that there's a guy Wheeling a scooter only in Miami uh but it's nice to see that we're getting back to a time when we have and please don't crucify me in the comments air quotes relatively affordable cars because if you lease this you can get the tax credit and depending on you know the lease amount this could be something that would be a good car to have just kind of to you know run errands in or take the kids to school uh I probably wouldn't road trip it after having a road trip the mini but there is something Charming about a little car in the city easy to park easy to turn easy to own under the hood of course is an electric motor it puts out 118 horsepower and 162 lb of torque it doesn't have a transmission cuz it doesn't need one but it will do 0 to 60 in about 8.5 seconds but more importantly Fiat says it'll do 0 to 30 in enough time to make you feel queasy so let's see if that is true I'm going to make this turn and then I'm going to give it a little bit of the accelerator it's no longer the gas pedal and see how it accelerates all right here we go full on that's 30 yeah that's good not quite uh tunnel vision uh but certainly very Lively ride is very European what I mean by that is well dampened um nice firm steering good steering wheel now of course for all of you guys who drive and love EVS you'll know that really the heart of the car is no longer the motor or engine if you're into internal combustion engines but really the battery and the new 2020 2 4 Fiat 500e has a 42 KW hour battery with 38 of those Kow usable for daily driving that gives you a range of about 149 mil in the city or if you put it in range mode or Sherpa mode you can get up to 167 now it doesn't charge all that quick 85 Kow at its Max and Fiat says that you can go from zero to 80% on a level three fast charger in about 35 minutes now the experience we had when we own the competitor to this which was the mini SE which had 104 miles of range was that on a road trip you would basically drive for an hour and then charge for an hour that had a 50 Kow charger so it was a little bit slower but 85 isn't going to set the world on fire so if you're going to charge this overnight on a level two charger at home it's going to take you 6 hours if you're going to plug it into the wall 36 hours so really road tripping not so much City Driving yeah it's fine compared to the old 500d this new one is actually 2 in longer 2 in wider and 1 in taller which gives you a little bit more interior room so if you're wondering how much room there is you do have enough room for let's say two roller bags and actually this boot as the BRZ would say I wonder how you say that in Italian is actually deeper than the previous model now for those of you who don't speak British English boot is of course trunk and underneath this boot bottom is a little storage space which gives you a run flat charging set up with air and of course a charger now unfortunately in America we're not going to get a charger but we are going to get a $600 credit toward a level two charger or charging depending on which you'd prefer all right if you're wondering if this will actually work as a city family car I fear the answer is no unless you have very small kids or no feet uh as you can tell I'm 6'2 I don't have any Headroom uh I barely have room for my back because this headrest is knocking into it and if I move the seat back I think I'd need somebody very short to drive so yeah it's got a back seat but in terms of utility for anybody who's over I'd say 5'5 it's not Grand as tight as the back seat is that's as roomy as the front seat is now I can move the seat way back here and I'm probably sitting too far back actually to drive the car um so there is 2 in more in length and I suppose in the front it does matter now the wheel also telescopes and tilts which is very nice uh and if you're wondering where's my cup holder it's actually hidden right here so the Italians have even thought of that now like many electric cars uh this also has an interesting door blocking mechanism it's actually just a push button with you push and then open so making it easy to get get in and out and like any twood door the door for such a short car is very long so you might have uh you know some issues even in the parking lot because you will hit whatever you're parked next to with this big ass door like the previous generation this Fiat 500e has push button transmission which is actually simple to use and I like that they didn't reinvent the wheel now they also didn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to your HVAC controls they're real buttons so you don't have to dig in the menu if you want to say Throw Some cool air on your body versus on your feet versus you know in the defroster uh the other nice thing is you do actually have a volume knob um so it's a rotary knob that kind of works like that which is actually fine uh once you get used to it and you do have uh three uh different Drive modes uh which allow you to use normal range or Sherpa and Sherpa is basically um Extended range one pedal driving whereas normal allows the car to Coast as if you're driving a traditional internal combustion engine so you pick however you want to drive it and we'll demonstrate those once we're on the road if you're familiar with what used to be FCA Now stantis Products then you'll love the OS uh in the screen it's basically UK connect uh which I have always found to be very intuitive and easy to use also of course you get Android auto Apple carplay Alexa integration uh and it's just a system that's you know very simple uh very intuitive uh and doesn't you know make you think too hard when you're say switching from Sirius to regular radio regular radio regular radio there we go to your phone I'm in normal right now but let me change it to range mode uh the first thing you notice in range mode is that it's basically one pedal driving so I don't have to have my foot on the brake uh and it should give me more regen oh yeah I can feel it immediately and if you're familiar with driving an electric car and you have gotten used to one pedal driving this will feel very familiar uh it um it's actually a really fun way to drive if and when you kind of get accustomed to not using the brake and not making your passenger sick uh so as soon as this light turns green we'll try uh range mode yeah City Driving yeah lot of stop and stop and more stop and then more stop after that all right here we go we're going to make a right turn we get off this busy street and construction so stop construction stop stop construction so we're going to make a right here and yeah let's see what this is like and then you let off I was going to say gas pedal once again accelerator it slows down um and that works really well and then Sherpa mode oh that's interesting so with Sherpa mode you get up to 165 is miles range uh and the first thing I noticed is that it turns off uh the air conditioning and when it's 90\\u00b0 outside that's not a good thing so once again one pedal driving turns off the HVAC gives you a little bit less power when you floor it uh and basically makes it very uncomfortable in Miami in the spring so um you know that might be something that you guys use in the midwest uh in fall and spring now if you think the Fiat 500e is Big let me put that in perspective because this is the original 1957 chin quento not only do you have suicide doors but you have a car that is dwarfed by the new 2024 but you know the great thing about them is you can kind of see the family resemblance right you've got eyes here you've got eyes there you've got a mouth here you got a mouth there and the word that comes to mind for me is just Charming of course the original Fiat 500e electric was this one it was a California compliance car in other words it didn't have a lot of range about 87 Mi but what it lacked in range it's certainly made up in style I mean orange and white how cool is that and then if you come over here you can kind of see these like little dimples and uh these are supposed to be for aerodynamics you know like a golf ball gives you better Arrow to give you better range I'm not sure sure that worked all that well back [Music] then of course stantis loves their Easter eggs and this car is built well let me show you and you can guess where it's built at first and foremost is this which is well a little Italian flag so you can probably guess where it's built but where in Italy is it built and of course there are Easter eggs for that there is uh one right there that you can look at and there is one right there that gives it all away and in case you didn't see enough Easter eggs uh on the phone charger is another Easter egg the skyline of I spec toino which uh also doubles as a phone charger yeah how cool is that now if you're wondering if you can get your chento e is that electricity sorry bad accent with Knack in other words North American charging standard the answer is no for now the Fiat 500e comes with good old CCS until all the other manufacturers get together and switch over so U CCS it is the only kind complaint that I have is the seat is a little too firm for my big cushy American butt uh but overall you know I like little cars I have to be honest I'm a kind of a huge Fanboy of small little City cars uh and what makes this car to me very special is that it feels relatively expensive while it's relatively affordable please don't crucify me in the comments uh but I think when you see the lease rates this will be the kind of car that if you want something and if you're in New York La Chicago Miami Houston probably not uh that is electric and that does uh give you uh kind of that sense that you can zip in and out of uh traffic and do it with you know little fuss um then this is probably the car for you until the new mini SE comes out uh which will obviously directly compete with this there are two models of the new Fiat 500 this is called the red and not just because it's red the red means that you get red mirror caps you get a red logo and some other red things but you can get it in black and you can get it in white 32,500 starting with a $1,500 destination fee Ser at$ 34,000 but as face said most people will probably lease this to get the 7500 federal tax credit in which case you'll probably save a lot of money they have not yet announced lease prices but I remember the old one in California back in the day of course here comes the train give me a second it's a short train you can think about what I'm talking about all right the old one you could lease for $99 a month and I suspect uh this will be more expensive but probably not much more there's also an upper end model inspired by and that's about $36,000 and you get vegan leather is there such a thing that seems like an oxymoron but you do get vegan leather uh you get a better sound system you get kind of nicer interior uh but for me uh this red model is about perfect so as always this is Roman reporting for the fast lane car at the beginning of this video I said I'll let you know whether you should buy it lease it rented or forget it that's an easy one lease it of course that's the way you want to save as much money as possible and if you want to see all of our coverage and not just our EV coverage go to alt tf. as always I will see you next time [Music] ciaoo\",\n          \"[Music] the fiat 500 is one of the most popular small cars on sale i should know i bought one but being popular doesn't necessarily mean it's the best i should know i bought one now the old one which is one that i've got was first around in 2007 and was is starting to feel a little bit long in the tooth but now we've got a new one look at this electric one looks very familiar but feels anything but i'll tell you what while i'm here i'll do a review but like and subscribe please and bell button oh and share it share it with your friends it's worth mentioning that you can still buy an old fiat 500 a fiat 500 with a hybrid badge on the boot lid no less this isn't it this is the all-new pure electric 500 it'll do up to 199 miles on a charge look closely and you'll notice the new front end new lights which i think look like cute little eyelids and new bumpers there's no grill now either the overall shape is pretty iconic though and it stays the same and like before you can buy the car with a retractable roof for around two and a half grand extra the biggest visual changes come here in the cabin you've got this very nice ten and a quarter inch screen here in the middle which is optional if you go for the lower trims and these very nice digital instrument panel which is just behind the steering wheel again it looks lovely the infotainment oh my goodness so much better than what i have to contend with it is so functional got loads of features it is very responsive as well i mean i can only dream of having wireless apple carplay and android auto in mind i don't have that but you sit in here and you're just instantly connected and there's also an app so that you can keep up to date on your charging and stuff as well which is just fabulous the old one my one just basically feels like a whole load of cheap plastic whereas this one feels like it's been finished to a higher standard however thea have been very clever because this long swathe of black it's just a very clever way of disguising the fact that it's just one long piece of cheap plastic-ness however i do like the piano keys and i feel like the steering wheel is wrapped in a really quite lovely material oh and the door opens with a button rather than a cheap plastic handle look practicality-wise this is still a very small car but you do have some storage door bins cubbies places to put your phone i mean i will show you the rear seats and the boot in a bit there are four main specs to choose from the most basic car is one of the cheapest new evs on the market and is the only one available with the smaller of the two batteries fiat says it will do miles on a charge and if you only poodle around town it could be a really shrewd purchase those cars don't get an infotainment screen at all though you'll either need to add on that as an option or make do with the mobile phone cradle that's provided as standard icon and laprima cars come fully stocked with bigger wheels and different fabrics inside but they aren't really worth the hefty premium you'll pay try hard enough and you can easily spend more than thirty thousand pounds on one of these four specs are available at car buyer dot co uk right first things first shout out to this driving position it is so much better than the old version that's largely thanks to the electric specific packaging which is basically freed up a lot of space so helps make everything be a lot more comfortable but the compliments don't stop there because whipping out that old rattly petrol engine has transformed this 500 i mean it just feels so quiet but so nippy and quick and it makes it nice and easy to drive as well just what you want in a small city car now the electric motor might only produce 117 brake horsepower but you don't really need any more than that in a car of this size i mean not to 62 takes nine seconds but really it's the naught to 30 that i think is a much better measurement for a car like this the action trim has a slightly smaller battery but feels just as quick now by mounting the batteries on the floor has really helped make this car surprisingly agile i mean it's a lot better than the top heavy rolly old version one of my little bug bears is the light steering because it can feel a little bit vague in this new one however it does have a super tight turning circle let me show you ready look at this love that that was fairly obvious this car has been designed to be at its best while it's in and around town but unlike the old one it doesn't feel so out of its depth when it's on faster roads like this you do have some different driving modes normal which is um normal so it gives you all the power and performance that you need if you're not in a hurry there is range mode which what that does is just restricts a little bit of power and ramps up the regenerative braking helps you maximize your range speaking of maximizing range there is also if things get desperate sherpa mode now sherpa mode will basically guarantee that you're going to get to your destination with power left in the battery because not only does it severely reduce the output what's coming out of the electric motor but it gives you a top speed limit of 50 mile an hour and it turns off the climate control and then you're not going to want to use it that often but it just might come in handy if you're less careful than i am oh can i just mention one more thing please when you turn the car off it does a really creepy song ready [Music] sounds like it's from horror film i don't want to hear that at night while the new 500 beats most of its rivals when it comes to range the renault zoe aside it sits somewhere in the middle of the pack when it comes to charging this mid-spec model with the bigger battery tops out at 85 kilowatts beating the mini electric's 50 kilowatt maximum but falling short of the honda ease 100 kilowatt peak charging speed still that's enough for 30 miles in five minutes or an 80 charge in just over half an hour it's worth noting that the smaller battery entry level model only charges at a mini matching 50 kilowatts charging either model at home is easily achievable overnight yeah it's definitely bigger in the front like i said earlier the driving position has improved dramatically but there's no forgetting this is still a small city car with a relatively short wheelbase so things were never going to be particularly transformative back here i'm five foot six i don't want to spend that much time back here if you're any taller you're just going to spend your whole time moaning in the driver's ear hole about how much you hate it back here i would like to say it's good for kids but it's not really it's a three-door car so it's just gonna be such faff getting the kids in and out of here in my version this is where i keep my two sausage dogs it's perfect for them it's perfect size actually the vwe up and the honda e are way more practical although in some markets fiat offer a rear hinged door on the passenger side to make things a little bit better back here but that's not available in the uk lovely stuff this is where you would keep your bags basically should i show you the boot i'll show you the boot if someone could let me out then i can show the boot yep now as soon as you see the boot that's when you realize why you're going to be keeping most of your bags on the rear seats because it's tiny 185 liters it's no different to the other one i'm not even gonna bother trying to get the car buy a suitcase in here because i know it doesn't fit because i have one of these even a mini is bigger than this and if you go for the convertible god help you because that letterbox opening is even less practical of course you can fold the seats down if you need to carry larger items though it's worth noting that the seats on the action models don't split down the middle so it's all or nothing but even so the area isn't huge and there's a step where the seat bases meet the boot floor there's a small amount of space under there for one of the cables but unfortunately it's not big enough for both and that boys and girls brings us very nicely to the new fiat 500s deal makers and deal breakers now electric only the 500 is impressively efficient 199 miles is a pretty realistic estimate and you might see more if you only drive in town the new 500 is not only vastly better than its petrol predecessor to drive it's fun compared to rivals nippy too theater has done just enough to make this new 500 feel new without abandoning its retro routes the bits you touch often feel high enough quality too but it's still on the small side whichever way you look at it this is not a car for those looking to carry much in the way of people or luggage finally while the cheapest cars are good value you miss out on some pretty key kit and the electric range is much shorter too this new fiat 500 is so much better than the old petrol one did i tell you that i've got the old petrol one yeah because i have and this car is a much more accomplished car in comparison i mean we'd recommend stepping up to the mid-spec model if you can because then you've got a bigger battery you've got the more funky infotainment system but if you can only afford to go to the entry-level model you can buy one knowing that you're going for one of the most fun one of the most characterful and more importantly one of the most frugal cars on sale this was well overdue an update and it was well worth the wait and now i hate my car if you fancy yourself a small ev or just a bit more space or a bit more range then why not watch our review of the renault zoe or our electric cars playlist thanks for watching\"\n        ],\n

thomas shelby in birmingham the home\\u00a0\\nof peaky blinders with the cheeky cento blinder\\u00a0\\u00a0 i did say that and that's the reason why i'm\\u00a0\\ndressed as such a turn-of-the-century fashionista\\u00a0\\u00a0 but the thing is is i couldn't drive this in\\u00a0\\nitaly so i brought it to birmingham because\\u00a0\\u00a0 this particular part of birmingham back in the\\u00a0\\n1800s was known as the italian quarter little\\u00a0\\u00a0 italy where a lot of italian immigrants came and\\u00a0\\nof course piggy blinders is filmed and set here\\u00a0\\u00a0 and the shelby family the peaky blinders were a\\u00a0\\nreal gangster family but before i go into all that\\u00a0\\u00a0 this is the bit that we need to talk about this\\u00a0\\nis a ground-up new car and it's ever so slightly\\u00a0\\u00a0 bigger in all respects than the old 500 and it's\\u00a0\\ngoing to be made in turin in italy whereas before\\u00a0\\u00a0 it was made in poland but is it any good i'm\\u00a0\\njohnny smith welcome to the late break show\\u00a0\\u00a0 now i'm going to a couple of areas around the\\u00a0\\ndigbeth region of birmingham and that is because\\u00a0\\u00a0 that's where the italian quarter came to be around\\u00a0\\nthe early part of the 1800s people came across\\u00a0\\u00a0 from northern italy mostly because of napoleonic\\u00a0\\noccupation and famine and they brought with them\\u00a0\\u00a0 skills of being entertainers and um precision\\u00a0\\nworkers engineers late part of the 1800s a lot\\u00a0\\u00a0 of southern italians came and congregated\\u00a0\\nhere and they brought with them things\\u00a0\\u00a0 like organ grinding skills and ice cream\\u00a0\\ni love the fact that fiat has finally made\\u00a0\\u00a0 a 500 electric for a global audience\\u00a0\\nbecause the original one that most people\\u00a0\\u00a0 have never driven came out in 2013 was only\\u00a0\\navailable weirdly in california and oregon\\u00a0\\u00a0 in the states it was made in mexico and sold in\\u00a0\\nthose parts of the states strange very strange\\u00a0\\u00a0 they had about 84 to 87 miles of range type\\u00a0\\none connector so quite old-school so it's 61\\u00a0\\u00a0 millimeters longer 56 millimeters wider and 22\\u00a0\\nmillimeters longer in the wheelbase in other\\u00a0\\u00a0 words there's a chance it might have a bit more\\u00a0\\nroom inside than the previous 500 which is no bad\\u00a0\\u00a0 thing the design is unmistakably 500 but they've\\u00a0\\nmade it a bit more i was going to say brutish\\u00a0\\u00a0 let's just call it less cutesy because it's not\\u00a0\\nexactly a brutal 500 but it's got these kind of\\u00a0\\u00a0 little overlapping eyebrows with kind of a bad boy\\u00a0\\nbonnet if you remember 90s modified cars we used\\u00a0\\u00a0 to do this the bad boy bonnet front wheel drive of\\u00a0\\ncourse this is the first fiat 500 to be available\\u00a0\\u00a0 with 17-inch wheels 17s they look massive on this\\u00a0\\ni've got the convertible version and it will be\\u00a0\\u00a0 available just like the existing 500 as a hard top\\u00a0\\nor a or a convertible but three door only or two\\u00a0\\u00a0 door because it's the convertible this particular\\u00a0\\nshape is only going to be available as electric so\\u00a0\\u00a0 this is going on sale alongside the existing shape\\u00a0\\n500 that's been face lifted an awful lot in its\\u00a0\\u00a0 piston full but when that gets phased out you'll\\u00a0\\nonly be able to buy a 500 as an electric car\\u00a0\\u00a0 right let's have a look under here\\u00a0\\nbecause the fiat 500 e is available in two\\u00a0\\u00a0 flavors of tune the city range and the long\\u00a0\\nrange and the difference really is motor\\u00a0\\u00a0 and battery size the city range is 70 kilowatt\\u00a0\\nmotor and the long range is 87 kilowatt motor\\u00a0\\u00a0 okay which means north to 62 is a bit slower\\u00a0\\nfor the city car nine and a half seconds to 62\\u00a0\\u00a0 versus nine seconds to 62 with the long range\\u00a0\\ntop speed is lower with the city 84 miles an hour\\u00a0\\u00a0 long range 93 miles an hour the battery partner\\u00a0\\nfor this car is samsung and apparently they've got\\u00a0\\u00a0 these interesting modules a first application\\u00a0\\nintegrating calling and additional functions\\u00a0\\u00a0 directly into the modules which allows battery\\u00a0\\npacks to increase in energy density now what\\u00a0\\u00a0 that really means is the fact that they've\\u00a0\\nmanaged to get a nice liquid cool battery pack\\u00a0\\u00a0 into quite a small place it's 42 kilowatt hours\\u00a0\\nif you've bought the long range version and it's\\u00a0\\u00a0 23.7 kilowatt hours if you buy the city version\\u00a0\\nwhat does that mean uh range wise 199 mile range\\u00a0\\u00a0 wltp for the long range and 115 miles range for\\u00a0\\nthe city car this car the car i'm testing today\\u00a0\\u00a0 is the top range car which is la prima there are\\u00a0\\nfour spec levels and we'll talk about the spec\\u00a0\\u00a0 levels in a sec but basically that means this\\u00a0\\nis the long range car with a 42 kilowatt hour\\u00a0\\u00a0 battery pack with 199 mile range capability so\\u00a0\\nwhen you set the sat nav on the electric 500 it\\u00a0\\u00a0 gives you all the charging points it's actually\\u00a0\\nquite a high resolution bigger screen for the um\\u00a0\\u00a0 the top ranking models at this 10.25 inch rather\\u00a0\\nthan seven inch steering on 500 is always light\\u00a0\\u00a0 it's a car geared around city life which is why\\u00a0\\nev makes a lot of sense and although you might\\u00a0\\u00a0 discount the 23.7 kilowatt hour city range version\\u00a0\\nthat does 115 miles actually when you think about\\u00a0\\u00a0 it there's so many of these cars that just live\\u00a0\\nin cities and don't go out beyond the city limits\\u00a0\\u00a0 which makes sense and in city use you can probably\\u00a0\\nget more than 115 miles okay this i think is\\u00a0\\u00a0 faisaly street now back in the days of the italian\\u00a0\\nquarter i'm pretty sure there was no laser quest i'm pretty sure yeah so just like the previous version of the 500\\u00a0\\nthe convertible isn't a true convertible in the\\u00a0\\u00a0 in the traditional sense it still has a metal\\u00a0\\nstructure on the roof it just peels back the\\u00a0\\u00a0 middle section so it'll either go back to there\\u00a0\\non one push or it'll go but down to there on two\\u00a0\\u00a0 pushes what it means is the roof stays bunched\\u00a0\\nup here your rear visibility is quite bad but\\u00a0\\u00a0 it's very stylish so i'd say it's more of a sort\\u00a0\\nof full-length mad sunroof than it is a cabrio\\u00a0\\u00a0 come and have a look inside your cheeky\\u00a0\\ncento blinder i'm going to keep saying that\\u00a0\\u00a0 so you've got a two spoke steering wheel\\u00a0\\nwhich is really similar to the honda e\\u00a0\\u00a0 the 500 badge this can be ordered as a two tone so\\u00a0\\nof course you've got no gear shifter because it's\\u00a0\\u00a0 single speed electric so it just does prnd for\\u00a0\\nthe um the transmission just along the top here\\u00a0\\u00a0 this particular car being the high spec\\u00a0\\nhas the pad for wireless phone charging\\u00a0\\u00a0 just inside this cubby here and it has\\u00a0\\nan embossed outline of the turin skyline\\u00a0\\u00a0 to remind you that this is made in turin and\\u00a0\\ndown here in the door handle grab there's an\\u00a0\\u00a0 embossed picture of a classic fiat 500 i used\\u00a0\\nto have one of those and it says made in torino\\u00a0\\u00a0 and actually quite similar to the honda e\\u00a0\\ncome to think of it is this little plinth\\u00a0\\u00a0 here between the seats you've got an armrest here\\u00a0\\nbut the plinth has your e modes what your e-modes\\u00a0\\u00a0 are is your driving modes and there's three of\\u00a0\\nthem i mean normal which is what it defaults to\\u00a0\\u00a0 if i go to range mode it kind of backs off\\u00a0\\nthe top speed a little bit and it might\\u00a0\\u00a0 back off the air conditioning and stuff but\\u00a0\\nthen you've got a third mode called sherpa\\u00a0\\u00a0 which is like the get me home mode it backs\\u00a0\\noff the top speed completely it won't let you\\u00a0\\u00a0 use the heating or the air con i don't think\\u00a0\\nand it really dumbs down the throttle so that\\u00a0\\u00a0 is like i just want to get home i'm running\\u00a0\\nlow on power i love the fact it's called\\u00a0\\u00a0 sherpa it'll guide you home but the problem is\\u00a0\\ni think of sherpa as a 1970s builders van the\\u00a0\\u00a0 sort of thing you'd see around here in the olden\\u00a0\\ndays not as old as piggy blinders but you know i\\u00a0\\u00a0 don't think they had cards in peaky blenders\\u00a0\\ni know they did so i've got it in normal mode\\u00a0\\u00a0 if i stick it in range mode what i didn't mention\\u00a0\\nbefore the main difference between range mode and\\u00a0\\u00a0 normal mode is you have the same amount of power\\u00a0\\nbut it's one pedal driving so it'll hold it now\\u00a0\\u00a0 and it'll bring it to a complete standstill\\u00a0\\nusing do it by just coming off the throttle\\u00a0\\u00a0 there is no regen that you can dial in dial out\\u00a0\\nit's either range mode or normal mode where it has\\u00a0\\u00a0 very very minor regen braking so i come off the\\u00a0\\nbrake now and it's actually really aggressive\\u00a0\\u00a0 sort of like level three on my kia soul\\u00a0\\nor maximum b on a on an e-goal for example\\u00a0\\u00a0 i think they've done a good job with this\\u00a0\\nyou know it's just good to have a bigger\\u00a0\\u00a0 i hate the term portfolio of city car size you\\u00a0\\nknow this kind of size car that's available\\u00a0\\u00a0 as an electric vehicle and it's interesting it's\\u00a0\\ncharismatic it's got a great selection of textures\\u00a0\\u00a0 and tech this particular one that i'm testing\\u00a0\\ntoday is la prima trim level there's four trim\\u00a0\\u00a0 levels of the 500e action passion icon and laprima\\u00a0\\ni'll put some details on screen of what that means\\u00a0\\u00a0 but basically this is the top one with the\\u00a0\\nconvertible option now on the right hand side\\u00a0\\u00a0 of the steering wheel these buttons here for your\\u00a0\\nlevel two autonomy which is a first in this car\\u00a0\\u00a0 segment and that is lane keep assist or adaptive\\u00a0\\ncruise control and speed limiter there are also\\u00a0\\u00a0 volume controls on the back of the wheel here and\\u00a0\\nyou can change the station so there's buttons on\\u00a0\\u00a0 the front and on the back of the wheel so if i was\\u00a0\\ngoing to buy that the longer range battery pack\\u00a0\\u00a0 which this has it's higher in range capability\\u00a0\\nthan the honda e than the mini and the e up\\u00a0\\u00a0 but i would also urge you to consider the\\u00a0\\nentry level renault zoe the zoe gets overlooked\\u00a0\\u00a0 the zoe's a really good car and with its revised\\u00a0\\ninterior and its tech lift i think it's a very\\u00a0\\u00a0 cool thing it's also exceptionally good value if\\u00a0\\nyou're looking to buy one of these what rivals are\\u00a0\\u00a0 there honda e is probably at the top of the list\\u00a0\\nand the mini e the mini electric and there's a\\u00a0\\u00a0 couple of other little ones to consider as well\\u00a0\\nnow one of the rivals i would pit this against\\u00a0\\u00a0 would be the e up the vw e up or the skoda city\\u00a0\\ngo iv or the um the say at me but you know what\\u00a0\\u00a0 i can't really pit them against that because it\\u00a0\\nseems that you can't really buy it anymore vw\\u00a0\\u00a0 don't necessarily want to sell it to you anymore\\u00a0\\nthey've sort of said they've they've run out of\\u00a0\\u00a0 stock or they're not replenishing stock because\\u00a0\\ni think they're bringing in the vwi d3 and stuff\\u00a0\\u00a0 like that there's a bit it's a bit of a shame\\u00a0\\ni might be wrong there but i would definitely\\u00a0\\u00a0 consider an e up or a um a say at me instead of\\u00a0\\nthis it's got better leg room as back passengers\\u00a0\\u00a0 if that's a thing oh look at that it's a honda crz\\u00a0\\nhybrid i like them dude driving it's got a proper\\u00a0\\u00a0 dodgy roll up on the go windows up smoking too\\u00a0\\nthat's full commitment to the cause if you're\\u00a0\\u00a0 watching this review and you're wondering would i\\u00a0\\nprefer a mini electric or would i prefer a honda e\\u00a0\\u00a0 well i've reviewed those both those cars in quite\\u00a0\\na lot of detail and i'll put the links to them up\\u00a0\\u00a0 here here's the mini one i have to say i really\\u00a0\\nlike this and then here's the honda e one if you\\u00a0\\u00a0 just take it from a style perspective this is\\u00a0\\nthe charge port on the fiat 500e on this side\\u00a0\\u00a0 it has these rubber bungs which are a\\u00a0\\nbit fiddly because they're on long stalks\\u00a0\\u00a0 but it does have a bit of illumination in there\\u00a0\\nand it has ccs which is your dc rapid charge on\\u00a0\\u00a0 the long range it'll charge up to 85 kilowatts\\u00a0\\nwhich is about 35 minutes zero to eighty percent\\u00a0\\u00a0 and on the city range it'll do up to 50 kilowatts\\u00a0\\nwhich is about 30 minutes zero to 80 percent\\u00a0\\u00a0 uh but if you want to do it on like an 11\\u00a0\\nkilowatt wall box two and a half hours for\\u00a0\\u00a0 the city and four hours 15 for the long range even\\u00a0\\nthe convertible has a bigger boot than the honda\\u00a0\\u00a0 e this is 185 liters a honda ease 171 liter boot\\u00a0\\ntension mini e 211 liters and the e up 250 liters\\u00a0\\u00a0 on the renault zoe's massive don't worry about\\u00a0\\nthe noise got some boys doing some digging to bury\\u00a0\\u00a0 a few things you ain't seen me\\u00a0\\nthis is interesting these are\\u00a0\\u00a0 automatic door handles where you just put your\\u00a0\\nhand into this aperture and there's just like a\\u00a0\\u00a0 touch sensitive pad you can yeah and then there's\\u00a0\\na button on the inside here to just press to leave\\u00a0\\u00a0 rather than a physical handle it's neat this is\\u00a0\\nan early car because it's left and drive straight\\u00a0\\u00a0 fresh from italy consignment that i got from\\u00a0\\nitaly all right but watch out for the rival gangs\\u00a0\\u00a0 so you've got your schedules you can schedule your\\u00a0\\ncharging when you want it to be you can set your\\u00a0\\u00a0 charging look like that or you can set your charge\\u00a0\\nyou've got five stages of charging here so you\\u00a0\\u00a0 don't have to charge it to maximum these seats on\\u00a0\\nthe higher ranking cars are really nice there's a\\u00a0\\u00a0 couple of different fabrics to choose from this\\u00a0\\nstuff is called sql sea qual and it uses 20 uh\\u00a0\\u00a0 polyester and plastic fibers that have\\u00a0\\nbeen pulled from and recycled from the sea\\u00a0\\u00a0 i believe they look great i'm a big fan of\\u00a0\\ncloth just like the honda e has a really\\u00a0\\u00a0 interesting kind of tweed in it the 500\\u00a0\\nlooks good with a bit of imaginative tweed\\u00a0\\u00a0 isofix is quite prominent actually really\\u00a0\\nobvious it's not covered up by anything\\u00a0\\u00a0 and there's two isofixes in the back it is a four\\u00a0\\nseat not a five um i'm not going to sit back there\\u00a0\\u00a0 last time i sat in the back of the 500 they had\\u00a0\\nto call for help the cabin's a great place to be\\u00a0\\u00a0 the quality of it's probably not quite as good as\\u00a0\\nthe mini and the the feel of the car it's perhaps\\u00a0\\u00a0 not quite as sharp as a mini cooper se as they\\u00a0\\ncall it the style's i think better than a mini\\u00a0\\u00a0 and the current mini electric is an\\u00a0\\nadaptation of a piston car whereas this isn't\\u00a0\\u00a0 so theoretically this should be a better tool\\u00a0\\nfor the job i'm really enjoying it so far i'm\\u00a0\\u00a0 very much enjoying it would i rather be sat in a\\u00a0\\nhungary the honda e is just one of those damn cars there's only one range version to choose from\\u00a0\\nwhich is disappointing but you still want it\\u00a0\\u00a0 you still want it i keep wanting the honda even\\u00a0\\nthough the range is not great 137 miles at best\\u00a0\\u00a0 i would be really surprised if this car doesn't\\u00a0\\nsell well the most important thing for fiat is to\\u00a0\\u00a0 get bums in seats of existing 500 drivers who are\\u00a0\\nused to driving a non-electric 500 a piston 500\\u00a0\\u00a0 and they want to taste what it's like going\\u00a0\\ninto the world of evie and that's precisely\\u00a0\\u00a0 what i think is vital to broaden\\u00a0\\ntheir kind of appeal of evs yeah that's that's okay it's like a laptop but the\\u00a0\\nturn off just sounds like either a strange circus\\u00a0\\u00a0 fun fare or a sorry ice cream van an italian ice\\u00a0\\ncream bun of course okay fiat 500e where am i at\\u00a0\\u00a0 with it is it a cheeky cento blinder i do actually\\u00a0\\nthink the fca group has done a fantastic job of it\\u00a0\\u00a0 i think it translates to an ev really well\\u00a0\\nyou've got the two battery sizes i think for me\\u00a0\\u00a0 i would want the bigger battery the 42 kilowatt\\u00a0\\nhour which makes it a better range car than the\\u00a0\\u00a0 mini which makes it a better car range than\\u00a0\\nthe honda e but then there's the problem\\u00a0\\u00a0 it's in the danger zone of being priced\\u00a0\\nnear the base model honda e and i think\\u00a0\\u00a0 what a car what a car it's so enjoyable but what\\u00a0\\nthis does i think this will draw a bigger crowd\\u00a0\\u00a0 ultimately and a crowd that maybe wouldn't\\u00a0\\nhave looked at an electric car beforehand\\u00a0\\u00a0 i think it's that right level of\\u00a0\\nsort of quality for the money as well\\u00a0\\u00a0 the mini is a more luxurious feeling car inside\\u00a0\\nand probably a little bit more enjoyable to drive\\u00a0\\u00a0 but the honda e has my attention in terms of\\u00a0\\ndesign overall it's a really difficult verdict\\u00a0\\u00a0 i'm not gonna lie what i would say though\\u00a0\\u00a0 is try this and try the mini and try the handy\\u00a0\\nand look at the zoe as well because they're\\u00a0\\u00a0 all fantastic cars what this ultimately does is\\u00a0\\nexpands the interest in this kind of size of car\\u00a0\\u00a0 as a full ev to a wider market and that's what\\u00a0\\ni want a wider adoption of electric vehicles it's not a very good verdict is it but that's the\\u00a0\\none you're gonna get thanks for watching if you\\u00a0\\u00a0 have already subscribed thanks for subscribing\\u00a0\\nif you're a patreon you subscribe to me through\\u00a0\\u00a0 patreon and pay two or three pounds a month\\u00a0\\nthank you very much for supporting the late\\u00a0\\u00a0 break show hope you've enjoyed it i'm gonna\\u00a0\\nget out of these clothes i feel a bit awkward foreign\",\n          \"[Music] hey guys meet the brand new 2024 Fiat 500e and of course the E stands for electric and if you know anything about the Fiat chin quento you know that it came around in 1957 as a city car and this of course is the latest version in fact Fiat has only built an electric version of the Fiat 500e and in this video we're going to take it for a ride we're going to see how it does in this Miami Heat and traffic and of course we're going to tell you whether you should buy it leas and rent it or forget it so let's hit the [Music] road now you may be wondering what does this little guy compete with and there are two cars that come to mind immediately of course the mini SE uh which is coming back with also ironically 150 miles of range uh and the bolt which is gone but you know who knows so we are coming back to a time of having small electric cars that are oh God I'm going to hate this because you guys are G me so much you know what in the comments dare I say affordable look at that there's a guy Wheeling a scooter only in Miami uh but it's nice to see that we're getting back to a time when we have and please don't crucify me in the comments air quotes relatively affordable cars because if you lease this you can get the tax credit and depending on you know the lease amount this could be something that would be a good car to have just kind of to you know run errands in or take the kids to school uh I probably wouldn't road trip it after having a road trip the mini but there is something Charming about a little car in the city easy to park easy to turn easy to own under the hood of course is an electric motor it puts out 118 horsepower and 162 lb of torque it doesn't have a transmission cuz it doesn't need one but it will do 0 to 60 in about 8.5 seconds but more importantly Fiat says it'll do 0 to 30 in enough time to make you feel queasy so let's see if that is true I'm going to make this turn and then I'm going to give it a little bit of the accelerator it's no longer the gas pedal and see how it accelerates all right here we go full on that's 30 yeah that's good not quite uh tunnel vision uh but certainly very Lively ride is very European what I mean by that is well dampened um nice firm steering good steering wheel now of course for all of you guys who drive and love EVS you'll know that really the heart of the car is no longer the motor or engine if you're into internal combustion engines but really the battery and the new 2020 2 4 Fiat 500e has a 42 KW hour battery with 38 of those Kow usable for daily driving that gives you a range of about 149 mil in the city or if you put it in range mode or Sherpa mode you can get up to 167 now it doesn't charge all that quick 85 Kow at its Max and Fiat says that you can go from zero to 80% on a level three fast charger in about 35 minutes now the experience we had when we own the competitor to this which was the mini SE which had 104 miles of range was that on a road trip you would basically drive for an hour and then charge for an hour that had a 50 Kow charger so it was a little bit slower but 85 isn't going to set the world on fire so if you're going to charge this overnight on a level two charger at home it's going to take you 6 hours if you're going to plug it into the wall 36 hours so really road tripping not so much City Driving yeah it's fine compared to the old 500d this new one is actually 2 in longer 2 in wider and 1 in taller which gives you a little bit more interior room so if you're wondering how much room there is you do have enough room for let's say two roller bags and actually this boot as the BRZ would say I wonder how you say that in Italian is actually deeper than the previous model now for those of you who don't speak British English boot is of course trunk and underneath this boot bottom is a little storage space which gives you a run flat charging set up with air and of course a charger now unfortunately in America we're not going to get a charger but we are going to get a $600 credit toward a level two charger or charging depending on which you'd prefer all right if you're wondering if this will actually work as a city family car I fear the answer is no unless you have very small kids or no feet uh as you can tell I'm 6'2 I don't have any Headroom uh I barely have room for my back because this headrest is knocking into it and if I move the seat back I think I'd need somebody very short to drive so yeah it's got a back seat but in terms of utility for anybody who's over I'd say 5'5 it's not Grand as tight as the back seat is that's as roomy as the front seat is now I can move the seat way back here and I'm probably sitting too far back actually to drive the car um so there is 2 in more in length and I suppose in the front it does matter now the wheel also telescopes and tilts which is very nice uh and if you're wondering where's my cup holder it's actually hidden right here so the Italians have even thought of that now like many electric cars uh this also has an interesting door blocking mechanism it's actually just a push button with you push and then open so making it easy to get get in and out and like any twood door the door for such a short car is very long so you might have uh you know some issues even in the parking lot because you will hit whatever you're parked next to with this big ass door like the previous generation this Fiat 500e has push button transmission which is actually simple to use and I like that they didn't reinvent the wheel now they also didn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to your HVAC controls they're real buttons so you don't have to dig in the menu if you want to say Throw Some cool air on your body versus on your feet versus you know in the defroster uh the other nice thing is you do actually have a volume knob um so it's a rotary knob that kind of works like that which is actually fine uh once you get used to it and you do have uh three uh different Drive modes uh which allow you to use normal range or Sherpa and Sherpa is basically um Extended range one pedal driving whereas normal allows the car to Coast as if you're driving a traditional internal combustion engine so you pick however you want to drive it and we'll demonstrate those once we're on the road if you're familiar with what used to be FCA Now stantis Products then you'll love the OS uh in the screen it's basically UK connect uh which I have always found to be very intuitive and easy to use also of course you get Android auto Apple carplay Alexa integration uh and it's just a system that's you know very simple uh very intuitive uh and doesn't you know make you think too hard when you're say switching from Sirius to regular radio regular radio regular radio there we go to your phone I'm in normal right now but let me change it to range mode uh the first thing you notice in range mode is that it's basically one pedal driving so I don't have to have my foot on the brake uh and it should give me more regen oh yeah I can feel it immediately and if you're familiar with driving an electric car and you have gotten used to one pedal driving this will feel very familiar uh it um it's actually a really fun way to drive if and when you kind of get accustomed to not using the brake and not making your passenger sick uh so as soon as this light turns green we'll try uh range mode yeah City Driving yeah lot of stop and stop and more stop and then more stop after that all right here we go we're going to make a right turn we get off this busy street and construction so stop construction stop stop construction so we're going to make a right here and yeah let's see what this is like and then you let off I was going to say gas pedal once again accelerator it slows down um and that works really well and then Sherpa mode oh that's interesting so with Sherpa mode you get up to 165 is miles range uh and the first thing I noticed is that it turns off uh the air conditioning and when it's 90\\u00b0 outside that's not a good thing so once again one pedal driving turns off the HVAC gives you a little bit less power when you floor it uh and basically makes it very uncomfortable in Miami in the spring so um you know that might be something that you guys use in the midwest uh in fall and spring now if you think the Fiat 500e is Big let me put that in perspective because this is the original 1957 chin quento not only do you have suicide doors but you have a car that is dwarfed by the new 2024 but you know the great thing about them is you can kind of see the family resemblance right you've got eyes here you've got eyes there you've got a mouth here you got a mouth there and the word that comes to mind for me is just Charming of course the original Fiat 500e electric was this one it was a California compliance car in other words it didn't have a lot of range about 87 Mi but what it lacked in range it's certainly made up in style I mean orange and white how cool is that and then if you come over here you can kind of see these like little dimples and uh these are supposed to be for aerodynamics you know like a golf ball gives you better Arrow to give you better range I'm not sure sure that worked all that well back [Music] then of course stantis loves their Easter eggs and this car is built well let me show you and you can guess where it's built at first and foremost is this which is well a little Italian flag so you can probably guess where it's built but where in Italy is it built and of course there are Easter eggs for that there is uh one right there that you can look at and there is one right there that gives it all away and in case you didn't see enough Easter eggs uh on the phone charger is another Easter egg the skyline of I spec toino which uh also doubles as a phone charger yeah how cool is that now if you're wondering if you can get your chento e is that electricity sorry bad accent with Knack in other words North American charging standard the answer is no for now the Fiat 500e comes with good old CCS until all the other manufacturers get together and switch over so U CCS it is the only kind complaint that I have is the seat is a little too firm for my big cushy American butt uh but overall you know I like little cars I have to be honest I'm a kind of a huge Fanboy of small little City cars uh and what makes this car to me very special is that it feels relatively expensive while it's relatively affordable please don't crucify me in the comments uh but I think when you see the lease rates this will be the kind of car that if you want something and if you're in New York La Chicago Miami Houston probably not uh that is electric and that does uh give you uh kind of that sense that you can zip in and out of uh traffic and do it with you know little fuss um then this is probably the car for you until the new mini SE comes out uh which will obviously directly compete with this there are two models of the new Fiat 500 this is called the red and not just because it's red the red means that you get red mirror caps you get a red logo and some other red things but you can get it in black and you can get it in white 32,500 starting with a $1,500 destination fee Ser at$ 34,000 but as face said most people will probably lease this to get the 7500 federal tax credit in which case you'll probably save a lot of money they have not yet announced lease prices but I remember the old one in California back in the day of course here comes the train give me a second it's a short train you can think about what I'm talking about all right the old one you could lease for $99 a month and I suspect uh this will be more expensive but probably not much more there's also an upper end model inspired by and that's about $36,000 and you get vegan leather is there such a thing that seems like an oxymoron but you do get vegan leather uh you get a better sound system you get kind of nicer interior uh but for me uh this red model is about perfect so as always this is Roman reporting for the fast lane car at the beginning of this video I said I'll let you know whether you should buy it lease it rented or forget it that's an easy one lease it of course that's the way you want to save as much money as possible and if you want to see all of our coverage and not just our EV coverage go to alt tf. as always I will see you next time [Music] ciaoo\",\n          \"[Music] the fiat 500 is one of the most popular small cars on sale i should know i bought one but being popular doesn't necessarily mean it's the best i should know i bought one now the old one which is one that i've got was first around in 2007 and was is starting to feel a little bit long in the tooth but now we've got a new one look at this electric one looks very familiar but feels anything but i'll tell you what while i'm here i'll do a review but like and subscribe please and bell button oh and share it share it with your friends it's worth mentioning that you can still buy an old fiat 500 a fiat 500 with a hybrid badge on the boot lid no less this isn't it this is the all-new pure electric 500 it'll do up to 199 miles on a charge look closely and you'll notice the new front end new lights which i think look like cute little eyelids and new bumpers there's no grill now either the overall shape is pretty iconic though and it stays the same and like before you can buy the car with a retractable roof for around two and a half grand extra the biggest visual changes come here in the cabin you've got this very nice ten and a quarter inch screen here in the middle which is optional if you go for the lower trims and these very nice digital instrument panel which is just behind the steering wheel again it looks lovely the infotainment oh my goodness so much better than what i have to contend with it is so functional got loads of features it is very responsive as well i mean i can only dream of having wireless apple carplay and android auto in mind i don't have that but you sit in here and you're just instantly connected and there's also an app so that you can keep up to date on your charging and stuff as well which is just fabulous the old one my one just basically feels like a whole load of cheap plastic whereas this one feels like it's been finished to a higher standard however thea have been very clever because this long swathe of black it's just a very clever way of disguising the fact that it's just one long piece of cheap plastic-ness however i do like the piano keys and i feel like the steering wheel is wrapped in a really quite lovely material oh and the door opens with a button rather than a cheap plastic handle look practicality-wise this is still a very small car but you do have some storage door bins cubbies places to put your phone i mean i will show you the rear seats and the boot in a bit there are four main specs to choose from the most basic car is one of the cheapest new evs on the market and is the only one available with the smaller of the two batteries fiat says it will do miles on a charge and if you only poodle around town it could be a really shrewd purchase those cars don't get an infotainment screen at all though you'll either need to add on that as an option or make do with the mobile phone cradle that's provided as standard icon and laprima cars come fully stocked with bigger wheels and different fabrics inside but they aren't really worth the hefty premium you'll pay try hard enough and you can easily spend more than thirty thousand pounds on one of these four specs are available at car buyer dot co uk right first things first shout out to this driving position it is so much better than the old version that's largely thanks to the electric specific packaging which is basically freed up a lot of space so helps make everything be a lot more comfortable but the compliments don't stop there because whipping out that old rattly petrol engine has transformed this 500 i mean it just feels so quiet but so nippy and quick and it makes it nice and easy to drive as well just what you want in a small city car now the electric motor might only produce 117 brake horsepower but you don't really need any more than that in a car of this size i mean not to 62 takes nine seconds but really it's the naught to 30 that i think is a much better measurement for a car like this the action trim has a slightly smaller battery but feels just as quick now by mounting the batteries on the floor has really helped make this car surprisingly agile i mean it's a lot better than the top heavy rolly old version one of my little bug bears is the light steering because it can feel a little bit vague in this new one however it does have a super tight turning circle let me show you ready look at this love that that was fairly obvious this car has been designed to be at its best while it's in and around town but unlike the old one it doesn't feel so out of its depth when it's on faster roads like this you do have some different driving modes normal which is um normal so it gives you all the power and performance that you need if you're not in a hurry there is range mode which what that does is just restricts a little bit of power and ramps up the regenerative braking helps you maximize your range speaking of maximizing range there is also if things get desperate sherpa mode now sherpa mode will basically guarantee that you're going to get to your destination with power left in the battery because not only does it severely reduce the output what's coming out of the electric motor but it gives you a top speed limit of 50 mile an hour and it turns off the climate control and then you're not going to want to use it that often but it just might come in handy if you're less careful than i am oh can i just mention one more thing please when you turn the car off it does a really creepy song ready [Music] sounds like it's from horror film i don't want to hear that at night while the new 500 beats most of its rivals when it comes to range the renault zoe aside it sits somewhere in the middle of the pack when it comes to charging this mid-spec model with the bigger battery tops out at 85 kilowatts beating the mini electric's 50 kilowatt maximum but falling short of the honda ease 100 kilowatt peak charging speed still that's enough for 30 miles in five minutes or an 80 charge in just over half an hour it's worth noting that the smaller battery entry level model only charges at a mini matching 50 kilowatts charging either model at home is easily achievable overnight yeah it's definitely bigger in the front like i said earlier the driving position has improved dramatically but there's no forgetting this is still a small city car with a relatively short wheelbase so things were never going to be particularly transformative back here i'm five foot six i don't want to spend that much time back here if you're any taller you're just going to spend your whole time moaning in the driver's ear hole about how much you hate it back here i would like to say it's good for kids but it's not really it's a three-door car so it's just gonna be such faff getting the kids in and out of here in my version this is where i keep my two sausage dogs it's perfect for them it's perfect size actually the vwe up and the honda e are way more practical although in some markets fiat offer a rear hinged door on the passenger side to make things a little bit better back here but that's not available in the uk lovely stuff this is where you would keep your bags basically should i show you the boot i'll show you the boot if someone could let me out then i can show the boot yep now as soon as you see the boot that's when you realize why you're going to be keeping most of your bags on the rear seats because it's tiny 185 liters it's no different to the other one i'm not even gonna bother trying to get the car buy a suitcase in here because i know it doesn't fit because i have one of these even a mini is bigger than this and if you go for the convertible god help you because that letterbox opening is even less practical of course you can fold the seats down if you need to carry larger items though it's worth noting that the seats on the action models don't split down the middle so it's all or nothing but even so the area isn't huge and there's a step where the seat bases meet the boot floor there's a small amount of space under there for one of the cables but unfortunately it's not big enough for both and that boys and girls brings us very nicely to the new fiat 500s deal makers and deal breakers now electric only the 500 is impressively efficient 199 miles is a pretty realistic estimate and you might see more if you only drive in town the new 500 is not only vastly better than its petrol predecessor to drive it's fun compared to rivals nippy too theater has done just enough to make this new 500 feel new without abandoning its retro routes the bits you touch often feel high enough quality too but it's still on the small side whichever way you look at it this is not a car for those looking to carry much in the way of people or luggage finally while the cheapest cars are good value you miss out on some pretty key kit and the electric range is much shorter too this new fiat 500 is so much better than the old petrol one did i tell you that i've got the old petrol one yeah because i have and this car is a much more accomplished car in comparison i mean we'd recommend stepping up to the mid-spec model if you can because then you've got a bigger battery you've got the more funky infotainment system but if you can only afford to go to the entry-level model you can buy one knowing that you're going for one of the most fun one of the most characterful and more importantly one of the most frugal cars on sale this was well overdue an update and it was well worth the wait and now i hate my car if you fancy yourself a small ev or just a bit more space or a bit more range then why not watch our review of the renault zoe or our electric cars playlist thanks for watching\"\n        ],\n
