0kDbvxpjLZs,New Fiat 500 electric in-depth review: another great-value EV!,Carbuyer,[Music] the fiat 500 is one of the most popular small cars on sale i should know i bought one but being popular doesn't necessarily mean it's the best i should know i bought one now the old one which is one that i've got was first around in 2007 and was is starting to feel a little bit long in the tooth but now we've got a new one look at this electric one looks very familiar but feels anything but i'll tell you what while i'm here i'll do a review but like and subscribe please and bell button oh and share it share it with your friends it's worth mentioning that you can still buy an old fiat 500 a fiat 500 with a hybrid badge on the boot lid no less this isn't it this is the all-new pure electric 500 it'll do up to 199 miles on a charge look closely and you'll notice the new front end new lights which i think look like cute little eyelids and new bumpers there's no grill now either the overall shape is pretty iconic though and it stays the same and like before you can buy the car with a retractable roof for around two and a half grand extra the biggest visual changes come here in the cabin you've got this very nice ten and a quarter inch screen here in the middle which is optional if you go for the lower trims and these very nice digital instrument panel which is just behind the steering wheel again it looks lovely the infotainment oh my goodness so much better than what i have to contend with it is so functional got loads of features it is very responsive as well i mean i can only dream of having wireless apple carplay and android auto in mind i don't have that but you sit in here and you're just instantly connected and there's also an app so that you can keep up to date on your charging and stuff as well which is just fabulous the old one my one just basically feels like a whole load of cheap plastic whereas this one feels like it's been finished to a higher standard however thea have been very clever because this long swathe of black it's just a very clever way of disguising the fact that it's just one long piece of cheap plastic-ness however i do like the piano keys and i feel like the steering wheel is wrapped in a really quite lovely material oh and the door opens with a button rather than a cheap plastic handle look practicality-wise this is still a very small car but you do have some storage door bins cubbies places to put your phone i mean i will show you the rear seats and the boot in a bit there are four main specs to choose from the most basic car is one of the cheapest new evs on the market and is the only one available with the smaller of the two batteries fiat says it will do miles on a charge and if you only poodle around town it could be a really shrewd purchase those cars don't get an infotainment screen at all though you'll either need to add on that as an option or make do with the mobile phone cradle that's provided as standard icon and laprima cars come fully stocked with bigger wheels and different fabrics inside but they aren't really worth the hefty premium you'll pay try hard enough and you can easily spend more than thirty thousand pounds on one of these four specs are available at car buyer dot co uk right first things first shout out to this driving position it is so much better than the old version that's largely thanks to the electric specific packaging which is basically freed up a lot of space so helps make everything be a lot more comfortable but the compliments don't stop there because whipping out that old rattly petrol engine has transformed this 500 i mean it just feels so quiet but so nippy and quick and it makes it nice and easy to drive as well just what you want in a small city car now the electric motor might only produce 117 brake horsepower but you don't really need any more than that in a car of this size i mean not to 62 takes nine seconds but really it's the naught to 30 that i think is a much better measurement for a car like this the action trim has a slightly smaller battery but feels just as quick now by mounting the batteries on the floor has really helped make this car surprisingly agile i mean it's a lot better than the top heavy rolly old version one of my little bug bears is the light steering because it can feel a little bit vague in this new one however it does have a super tight turning circle let me show you ready look at this love that that was fairly obvious this car has been designed to be at its best while it's in and around town but unlike the old one it doesn't feel so out of its depth when it's on faster roads like this you do have some different driving modes normal which is um normal so it gives you all the power and performance that you need if you're not in a hurry there is range mode which what that does is just restricts a little bit of power and ramps up the regenerative braking helps you maximize your range speaking of maximizing range there is also if things get desperate sherpa mode now sherpa mode will basically guarantee that you're going to get to your destination with power left in the battery because not only does it severely reduce the output what's coming out of the electric motor but it gives you a top speed limit of 50 mile an hour and it turns off the climate control and then you're not going to want to use it that often but it just might come in handy if you're less careful than i am oh can i just mention one more thing please when you turn the car off it does a really creepy song ready [Music] sounds like it's from horror film i don't want to hear that at night while the new 500 beats most of its rivals when it comes to range the renault zoe aside it sits somewhere in the middle of the pack when it comes to charging this mid-spec model with the bigger battery tops out at 85 kilowatts beating the mini electric's 50 kilowatt maximum but falling short of the honda ease 100 kilowatt peak charging speed still that's enough for 30 miles in five minutes or an 80 charge in just over half an hour it's worth noting that the smaller battery entry level model only charges at a mini matching 50 kilowatts charging either model at home is easily achievable overnight yeah it's definitely bigger in the front like i said earlier the driving position has improved dramatically but there's no forgetting this is still a small city car with a relatively short wheelbase so things were never going to be particularly transformative back here i'm five foot six i don't want to spend that much time back here if you're any taller you're just going to spend your whole time moaning in the driver's ear hole about how much you hate it back here i would like to say it's good for kids but it's not really it's a three-door car so it's just gonna be such faff getting the kids in and out of here in my version this is where i keep my two sausage dogs it's perfect for them it's perfect size actually the vwe up and the honda e are way more practical although in some markets fiat offer a rear hinged door on the passenger side to make things a little bit better back here but that's not available in the uk lovely stuff this is where you would keep your bags basically should i show you the boot i'll show you the boot if someone could let me out then i can show the boot yep now as soon as you see the boot that's when you realize why you're going to be keeping most of your bags on the rear seats because it's tiny 185 liters it's no different to the other one i'm not even gonna bother trying to get the car buy a suitcase in here because i know it doesn't fit because i have one of these even a mini is bigger than this and if you go for the convertible god help you because that letterbox opening is even less practical of course you can fold the seats down if you need to carry larger items though it's worth noting that the seats on the action models don't split down the middle so it's all or nothing but even so the area isn't huge and there's a step where the seat bases meet the boot floor there's a small amount of space under there for one of the cables but unfortunately it's not big enough for both and that boys and girls brings us very nicely to the new fiat 500s deal makers and deal breakers now electric only the 500 is impressively efficient 199 miles is a pretty realistic estimate and you might see more if you only drive in town the new 500 is not only vastly better than its petrol predecessor to drive it's fun compared to rivals nippy too theater has done just enough to make this new 500 feel new without abandoning its retro routes the bits you touch often feel high enough quality too but it's still on the small side whichever way you look at it this is not a car for those looking to carry much in the way of people or luggage finally while the cheapest cars are good value you miss out on some pretty key kit and the electric range is much shorter too this new fiat 500 is so much better than the old petrol one did i tell you that i've got the old petrol one yeah because i have and this car is a much more accomplished car in comparison i mean we'd recommend stepping up to the mid-spec model if you can because then you've got a bigger battery you've got the more funky infotainment system but if you can only afford to go to the entry-level model you can buy one knowing that you're going for one of the most fun one of the most characterful and more importantly one of the most frugal cars on sale this was well overdue an update and it was well worth the wait and now i hate my car if you fancy yourself a small ev or just a bit more space or a bit more range then why not watch our review of the renault zoe or our electric cars playlist thanks for watching
N3PcV-_kLR8,2023 Fiat 500e Convertible Review: A brilliant soft-top EV!,CarGurus UK,"[Music] today's video is in part a review of this convertible version of the electric fit 500 which is an interesting car in its own right but in addition to that we wanted to take a look at the market for convertibles in general what it's doing because actually it's going through a huge transition so we're going to look at that and what it means for buyers to tell this story our industry analysts at Karo UK conducted Research into the state of the convertible market and how it's changed over the last two decades what we didn't know was at the same time Fiat was doing its own study into convertibles but this time related to how driving them made you feel specifically it was scientifically measuring the emotional well-being of drivers first with the roof up and then with the roof down it found that roofless motoring increased the sense of Happiness felt by drivers by by between 6 and 20% while negative emotions such as frustration and anger fell by 20% so driving a convertible car is scientifically proven to be good for you which is good news what's less good is that our own research of Caro's UK has shown a significant decline in the availability of new convertibles to buy so in 2005 there were over 50 new convertible cars available from the UK's 30 biggest car brands today there are just 20 4 new convertibles available and what's more right now in 2023 of the UK's 30 biggest car brands less than half offer a convertible think about it Brands including Toyota Nissan voxal Honda Renault Land Rover Volvo mg all in the past have offered a convertible in some shape or form not any longer and with Choice dwindling so have sales so last year represented the lowest number of convertibles sold in the UK for 18 years so what does that mean in terms of actual numbers well in 2004 there were over 94,000 new convertibl sold in the UK whereas by the end of 2022 only 165,000 have been sold so why is [Music] that there's not one silver bullet that has caused the slowdown in sales of convertible but it's a combination of factors number one is think about the arrival of cars like the BMW X3 and the Range Rover Evoke and the Audi Q5 before that Convertibles were seen as the most stylish the most fashionable choice but then all of a sudden Along Came these very trendy looking Posh SUVs and then all of a sudden if you wanted to be fashionable you bought one of those Range Rover and VW have even tried to combine the appeal of SUVs and convertibles in one package of ultimate desirability but modest sales suggest it's the ruggedness that people want not the ruthlessness then of course there's the shift to electric cars now this remember is an area where manufacturers don't have a choice they either shift to electrification or they face crippling fines for missing emissions targets and so it follows that if you're manufacturer building a new car these days you're going to build an electric SUV cars like convertibles well they're just too Niche and this has only been exacerbated by The Fallout from the co 19 pandemic manufacturers need to play catchup and convertible are not the way to do it there are some brands that have stuck with convertibles though through thick and thin think about Mazda and its MX5 Porsche with its Boxster or Jeep with its Wrangler there are now even some brands that are starting to combine what seem like the most unlikely of Partners ruthless motoring and electrification which brings us back to today's testar the electric fat 500 which believe it or not is one of only four convertible EBS you can buy today from the UK's top 30 selling brands the other three in case you're wondering are from mini smart and arath with the arath 500e of course being the sporti sister car to this Fiat model now I should point out that F's design doesn't necessarily fit everybody's definition of a classic convertible which is because while the roof slides all the way back actually the windows the B pillar C pillar the roof rails they all stay in place however this is in some ways quite neat because it means you can have a fully ruthless experience but actually with this in place it keeps the buffeting inside to a minimum and it certainly doesn't harm the car's aesthetic appeal because the 500 remains one of the most stylish small cars on the road with some wonderful little nods to its Heritage okay let's look at the boot this is clever look F knows that if you open the boot with the roof like this it won't open properly so it automatically lifts the roof up a little bit before you can then access the boot right so 185 L of space in here small opening obviously this is not the most practical of designs however I think given that this is just a small convertible we can kind of give it a little bit of Grace there and probably the same could be said of the back seats so I will clamber in here and you will see that they are not the roomiest by any stretch of the imagination but you can just about get a couple of adults in here if you need it's a four- seater and again given this is a small convertible I feel like the you get rear seats at all a bit of a bonus the dash design has some flare to it although it's largely finished in hard plastics we do however applaud V it for retaining a separate panel for its heater controls rather than burying them in the infotainment system the driving position in this electric F 500 convertible is much the same as any modern day F 500 which is to say you sit quite upright quite High um it's not sporty at all but it is pretty comfortable uh steering wheel adjusts for reach and for height but in this particular car there's no height adjustment on the seat and to open and close the roof you just use these buttons up here and that can be done at any speed VI's 10.3 in infotainment screen is slightly laggy but packed with features Apple carplay and Android auto are included in this screen and on the smaller 7-in unit in the entry level model less impressive is the screen for the digital dials which is crammed with arguably too much information my other gripe is the lack of a reversing camera in this mid-spec icon trim now ordinarily in a car this small I would say that such features aren't that important however when you lower the roof in this like we have now it completely blocks The View out of the back so parking really just becomes guess [Music] workor unlike the abath 500e there's no fake exhaust sound in this Fiat version Instead at low speed the only noise you get is a tiny electronically generated at bit of noise to indicate to pedestrians that there's a car there while at higher speeds there is a bit of tire and wind noise but it's certainly not terrible even with the roof down in terms of performance again this car is a bit like the abath version in that it doesn't give you this great thump of power all in one go now admittedly the Fiat version only has 117 horsepower so there only so quick it's going to be but it's delivered in a really nice linear fashion it also rides better than you might expect traversing bumpy roads with far more composure than we've seen from previous F 500s the result is that while the 500 retains some cheekiness about the way it drives it's also a lot more grown up a lot more sophisticated it feels a bit less like a roller skate like old 500 used to and more like a a normal car but it still has a lot of charm I think Fat's done a really nice job with it I also like that the driving modes feel very different so if you leave it in normal mode there's no brake regen at all so it feels much more like a conventional car but use the switch here to put it into range mode and you get one pedal driving it's a bit like a BMW I3 in that regard so whether you like your car to drive like a normal car or like a fully electric brake regen car the 500's got you covered when it comes to range the electric 500 convertible can extract a wltp claimed 188 M range from it a 42 KW battery which can be recharged in 6 and 1/2 hours from a 7 kW home wallbox or rapid charge at up to 85 KW in which case a not to 80% charge takes around 35 minutes while this car's range might be a bit limited I think that's okay in the context of what it is because if you're going to be doing huge mileages then you probably don't really want a tiny car with a fabric roof now where the 500 convertible excels is in making everyday Journeys feel that bit more special it's just got so much charm and character and or combined with the freedom of open air motoring it also shows that electric cars and convertibles can work in Harmony and perhaps more importantly than that that the market for convertibles while down is certainly not out just yet would you consider a convertible fat 500 if so be sure to head to cars.co.za [Music]"
pCbZhz5GRmg,Fiat 500e Electric 2021 review - Does the basic £20k Action model still add up? / Electrifying,Electrifying,in 2021 here at electrifying we gave not one but two of our highly coveted awards to the fiat 500 the best small car of the year and the best overall car of the year now why i hear you ask well because it's a really decent car of course you get the retro chic styling then a fair amount of tech thrown in there are lots of different options available and it is comparatively well priced however that was for the car with the larger battery and a range of just under 200 miles it comes in at 24 000 pounds after the two and a half thousand pounds government grant but that is pretty good value right well wait till you hear about this this is the new fiat 500 action and it comes in at 20 495 pounds after the government grant okay it has a smaller battery less range less tech but you do save a chunk of cash so the real question that we are asking today is is the new fiat 500 as good at the bottom of the range as it is at the top so time to ask yourself what is more important to you touchscreen and toys or cash in your wallet do let us know in the comments below i'm still undecided what the answer to that question really is also do remember to subscribe because uh well let's be honest it helps our ad revenue doesn't it okay honestly is the best policy okay so what does 20 000 pounds get you when it comes to the fiat 500 well the good news is you still get this kind of cartoon cute styling about it which i think we've got to say everyone loves right let us know in the comments below because i'm undecided is this the look of an angry puppy or maybe an automotive pokemon or even danger mouse i'm not sure do let me know in the comments below because i really need to make a decision on this it's still a small four-seater perfect for nipping around town it still requires backseat passengers to gradually lose all feeling in their legs and it still has a weenie 185-litre boot that's about the size of my large rucksack so i would have to pack my weekly shopping very carefully to get it all in there and wise to note that you don't get the 50 50 split rear seats that you get in other models now there are petite 15 inch wheels and i hope you like this ice white color because that's the only standard shade all other colors are options and no you can't get the convertible roof in this small battery spec either but you know even though there's less chrome there's less color choice it still has the same styling that we all fell in love with with the fiat 500 and i think with this car it's maybe less about what you get and more about what you don't get which then makes for an interesting discussion because you really have to prioritize what you do on in a car probably most importantly it comes with a smaller 24 kilowatt-hour battery with a potential 115 mile range according to the wltp cycle and you thought the mini electric and honda e were a bit marginal with 145 and 137. now i know what you're thinking or you should be anyway miles will easily become double digits in winter and suddenly you're going to feel like you need to charge every time you stop but more on that in a minute now the first thing that you notice when you actually get inside the car is well there's kind of less to notice there isn't a huge amount going on but again that's fine i don't mind it being paired back because it's still functional you have a seven inch screen in front of you with all the usual information what you don't get is a touch screen in the center console here and instead you get a phone holder which is actually fine it means obviously you can put your mobile phone there i can still use that for my maps and my music which to be honest is enough to get me around so i'm quite happy with that the other thing that i do actually really like the design of are these seats they're called sequel seats and they are made from 100 recyclable materials including 10 from plastic found in the sea so there you go they've tried to use a bit of um sustainability in the materials on the car as well so it's not just zero emission of the tailpipe air con is present but it's manual and of the simplest kind there's no leather although i actually prefer the cloth seats to be honest and they adjust but not by much there is a stereo but no digital radio and although there are radio controls on the height adjustable wheel there is no cruise control there is keyless go and yes electric windows a couple of usb charge points and you still get safety systems like emergency braking lane keep assist and lots of air bags as well as electronic stability control an electric parking brake hill holder brake and rear parking sensors though actually it's not really skimped on the important kits interestingly you can option in a winter and radio pack and that adds stuff in like heated seats as well as a seven inch touchscreen with wireless carplay and android auto but that does cost 1 250 quid so it's not cheap oh and i must mention you do get a three pin granny charging cable thrown in but that's only a three kilowatt one if you want the mode three ccs but that's going to set you back 336 pounds okay so when you're in your driving position it is maybe a little bit more sparse than the other fiat 500 but i think it's just a bit more paired back you know so there's a little bit of detailing missing but overall it's still a really nice interior okay the things that i particularly miss are having heated seats and a heated steering wheel however heated steering wheel is a bit of a luxury really do you need it probably not heated seats however essential 100 essential in every car i ever drive and also if you think about when it comes to heating in the winter you want to be as efficient as possible so ideally don't heat the air just heat your legs so that's a little point from me i would definitely pay extra for the heated seats let's talk about the way it drives because again i would say it's actually not much different to be honest it has a slightly smaller battery therefore it's going to be a little bit lighter um so other than that i can't really notice a huge difference it's maybe a tiny bit slower but again i think unless you were jumping from one fear into the other then you're not really gonna notice um but actually it's got 162 pound foot of torque and that's what really counts to be honest that's the stuff you feel when you accelerate so it feels nice and fast to off the lights and from zero to 30 and that is what you need when you're nipping around town however don't get over excited and start trying to practice drag racing at the lights because it takes 9.5 seconds to get to 62 miles per hour so you will lose and let's be honest no one likes losing the seats are quite comfortable particularly because the head rest has a bit of memory foam in it and okay i'm sorry but this is one for the girls girls if you're ever wearing a ponytail and it actually gives you a bit of a headache because you can't put your head all the way back well now the memory foam is actually quite good for that so you can still sit with it or without ponytail and enjoy quite a comfortable seating position you know if you haven't experienced driving this via 500 yet then i would highly recommend it it's really worth just experiencing you'll appreciate how nippy it is also of course you really only have to use one pedal for the driving as soon as you lift your foot off the accelerator that regenerative braking kicks in and slows you right down so if you're planning to do some lazy driving or maybe just stuck in traffic then this is a car for you now as i mentioned earlier parking is an absolute joy in this car you can kind of punt it around town it is a small electric car and everyone loves it since i've been driving this today i swear i've just seen fiat 500s everywhere and everyone just gives each other a little a knowing nod a little smile a little wave there is a secret hidden underground fiat 500 club and i'd quite like to be part of it but back to the practical stuff because as far as charging goes the smaller battery on the 500 action can make use of a 50 kilowatt rapid charger so that's the same as something like a mini electric and it means you can top from zero to 80 percent in half an hour but that's more of a function of the size of the battery rather than it being particularly quick now typically on a homeware box you're looking at about four hours from empty to full which is fine but that means that probably if you're tottering around town you might want to top up a bit when you're at the shops or take advantage of those free parking spaces because there are a few around but you don't exactly get excess of range in the first place so what do i think well i want to make the point that cheap isn't the same as value for money they could be quite different things i don't think the 524 kilowatt is particularly cheap cheap but it probably is a value for money now we do bang on here at electrifying about getting the right size of battery for your personal use it's really important to look at this a smaller battery is lighter it's more efficient because of course the car has less weight to lug around and ultimately it is better for the environment but range is convenience you don't want to buy a problem you want to be able to think less because you can go further without having to charge and here's where it gets a bit sticky the smaller battery in the 500 action relegates it to being quite a specific city car it's still as cute as it can be and it's just about perfect for urban living and there's actually something quite refreshing about a car that's paired back to basics but i'd have to have another car in the garage to cope with everything else that i need in my life which at the end of the day limits its appeal now once i've added in some options that i actually really do want the action would end up being 1500 quid shy of the passion trim car with the bigger battery and more standard kit i think if you have a very specific commute or a standard routine you know exactly how many miles you'll be doing and that lower mileage works for you or perhaps you're just pottering around town then the basic 500 is going to be perfect however my personal recommendation would be to save up that little bit extra and go for the fiat 500 with the bigger battery now as ever if you would like to know more about the new 500 in general or any of the 500 actions competition like the say at me electric for around 20 000 pounds with much more range or the smart eq that costs 18 000 pounds and can travel 80 miles on a charge then please do come and log in at electrifying.com and we will attempt to answer all of your questions
3W2qN7F7F1A,"The Fiat 500e is so good, I'm BUYING one!",Electroheads,[Music] got no transmission tongue in so i can just if i want to touch your leg with my leg i can do that yeah you ready ready yes you ready yes hello electro hello electro heads welcome to rainy windy cloudy horrible cambridge cambridge very nice the weather rubbish rubbish country this coal isn't it why would you live here why do we live here why was i born here anyway it's an exciting day we have driven up to cambridge for an all of 45 minute drive of this new electric fiat 500 oh yes mate i'm so gassed we wouldn't usually travel for 45 minutes with a car we'd usually say don't worry we'll wait until there's a chance to have more time with it but this car we just wanted to get in it as soon as possible because this is definitely one of the most exciting uvs of the year on paper it's now the king of value for money city cars it wipes the floor with the mini electric and the hundred two cars that we love but the other thing that's quite exciting about this today is that this is potentially your new car you're thinking about getting one of these i actually am me and just to fill in the audience in case they don't know i am a notoriously recovering petrol head as the electro has like to call me i haven't even considered getting an electric car until very recently when i realized i need something to commute in i can't be using my car which we should probably not mention what that is let's just leave it at saying it's a big honking v8 and it inhales petrol yes like there's no tomorrow yes the time will come where if somebody says i have a v8 they will look at you and think you dis gusting pig we're not there yet luckily so i think i get away with it but i do need something like this and when i saw this on the press release it ticked a lot of boxes i've been looking forward to having you go in this thing for a really long time i think this is the first opportunity to drive it in the uk so we're very lucky to be here today even if it's just 45 minutes i think what we should do first find somewhere to park up do a little walking around leave the outside because there's a lot to talk about style-wise absolutely let's do it let's do it right welcome to the world's fastest walk-around of the new fiat 500 electric one take what happens happens first of all it's still a 500 isn't it it's modern but it's unmistakably a fiat 500. i like what they've done here they've taken the classic 500 styling cue and they've made it all futurey come around the side 19-inch wheels for this top spec model i think you're down to 15 inches on the base car but they're quite 17. 17 inches these are 17's oh yeah they're definitely not 19. 17-inch wheels this is going well so far around the side it's very blue quite pearlescent colored uh not for me i'd have that color over there look at that one that's nice isn't it but you know whatever bites your biscuits that's not an expression around the side around the side again unmistakably 500 it's quite thick it's got a nice little chunky stance on it it's a bit like a remote control car it's wider than the standard 500 and you can feel that when you're driving i'm told haven't had a go yet back here pretty good sized boot should we go inside let's oh it's horrible out there but it's nice in here welcome to the inside of the 500 electric look at that i've got a button instead of a door handle no transmission tunnel lots of room for activities down here love this two-tone two-spoke steering wheel so italian so iconic but really nice to use and really nice to hold big 10.25 inch touchscreen for this top spec model i think you get like an eight inch screen and the lower spec and then just a phone holder on the base spec car you also get this lovely weavy stuff here this is a wireless phone charging port it's got the torino skyline on it and inside the little door pockets there's a little cut out of a classic cinquecento love that also on this top spec car beautiful leather suites with the fiat logo embossed stitched is that embossed you're a boss thank you this weird slightly narrow little cubby space in there we've got a little glove box in here disappear 500 i love it physical buttons let's talk about those physical buttons along here these are really nice to use and you can actually still use them when you're on a bumpy road when it's dark at night and that is something you can't do with the top screen it's absolutely lovely in here it's not ultra futuristic tech fest like the honda e it's not conventional conventional car like the mini electric it's somewhere in between the two it feels familiar in here but also a little bit special i like it so colbert yes jack we've been driving this car for a few minutes now what's jumping out to you what do you think about how i mean i know for a fact that generally speaking i'm quite easy easily impressed you get excited i do get excited about stuff but especially when something like this is already on my mind and it's something i'm already considering so far the experience is amazing it feels really refined like it's well built everything about it the steering is amazing super light so easy to drive and this is exactly what i need it for just daily run around commuting i've not driven it just yet but i i had a quick go when we were just parked up early and the steering is ultra light like such a perfect city car driving experience and you're right the materials in here i mean we are in the top spec model here and that's why we've got the leather seats and the fancy kind of weave on the dash but it's beautiful the fit and finish is really nice would you describe it as a fun car to drive because i know you're a driving nerd you want to should we have a go wait how do you change the mode this little boy down here oh really oh okay not slow it's good plenty so normal mode where's the mode normal there we go we're in normal okay we're just going to floor it let's see oh wow oh mate that's quick okay okay i mean that's not too bad i like that i mean it wouldn't need to be any faster than that no 120 horsepower in this what i really like about this car is that if you've got a bit more money you can get a really nice one like this with the fancy materials and the big battery but the entry level car which with the grant 20 and a half thousand pounds is is a proper proper little budget electric car i'm sorry but 20 grand for a fully electric car with the latest tech this is this is a bargain in my opinion there's not much there's not much else for that sort of money it's worth mentioning in that entry level 20 and a half thousand pound car we don't get the big fancy touchscreen you just get a phone holder fine by me absolutely i quite like that actually your phone is the best infotainment there is you also won't be getting the fancy leather and all this stuff and the range will be 118 miles instead of 199. i mean i just like that you have the option there's the cheap one with the smaller range which is a real proper bargain or if you want a properly premium little city electric car you can have the poshmark which one would you go for oh you know i do love me some fancy toys and me what mainly appeals to me about the more expensive models is 200 miles of range in a little city car that's the topic the honda and the mini electric are what like 120 130 on a good day and how much they're like 30 grand are they not the honda e is about 30 grand yeah i think the mini is in the mid 20 thousands probably should have memorized these things before the fact don't matter you get a lot more range you get similar styling i think i almost prefer this especially when you consider how much this is 20 grand i know that's the entry point but i would definitely go for the icon which is the third one up i think we're looking at 25 000 pounds i think for the icon from five thousand off the hungary for another twice as much range basically exactly you know what controversially as much as i enjoy the wall of screens in the hungary this one central infotainment system does it all works better we've got no transmission time them in so i can just if i want to touch your leg with my leg yeah i just wanted to touch your leg but thanks thanks jake one thing i have to point out that is really really bugging me i mean really bugging me it's my left leg well that's not the car's fault is it no it's look it it is you were born with that i'm going to show you right now of an overlay of my feet where do i put this oh you've got no yeah little footsie literally it it's it it's so uncomfortable for the left leg that is an oversight that is an oversight that's that's my only complaint and it's it's really yeah it's just it's enough duly noted you do need that nice little foot rest for your left foot especially you just need a bit of super pedal car like this yeah so i think that's my only complaint oh rental e-scooters well fiat if you're watching this congratulations you've just converted a man from a snarling v8 mercedes into a little electric city car converter you're going to keep the mark on you yeah well i suppose this is progress mate you need to drive this thing i think i should i want you to have we got time to switch yeah i had a red light now we're gonna go oh yeah me go go go switch a room oh [Music] seatbelt we're turning right yeah okay oh super slick mate all right here we go go go go go go go yes yes yes yes yes [Music] well i think we'll probably wrap it up there because we're gonna have to go give this thing back in oh god 15 5 minutes we need to go back we need to go back thank you very much for watching we're going to do a proper review on this car when we get a chance to spend some proper time with it this was just a little first drive we'll just do it in cole's one when he buys one oh yeah we can do that i forgot well there you go do you want to wrap things up thank you for watching lecture heads make sure you subscribe to the channel check out our instagram and we will see you very soon ciao
KT3wzgHOuPw,2024 Fiat 500e is the perfect EV for the city,Autotrader,"smaller lighter Urban runabouts should be a no-brainer segment for the electric vehicle for some reason though it feels like automakers keep trying to cram larger and larger battery packs our way this just gives us heavier vehicles with longer charging times and massive hits to our wallets with respect to the asking price so it's almost a breath of fresh air to see a vehicle like this the allnew 2024 Fiat 500e curb weight 2,952 lb maybe that would seem like a lot for a subc compact car but for an EV it's pretty great to see a curb weight figure that starts with a two that's what we're dealing with here on the allnew Fiat 500e this is a front-wheel drive two-door hatchback with room for four on the inside speaking of the inside Fiat is going for a combination of past homage meets modern the steering wheel is inspired by the original Fiat 500 from 1957 while the 10 and 1/4 in Center screen wasn't offered back then it runs the UK connect 5 system which works quite well and pairs nicely with the 7-in digital cluster ahead of the driver as for the trim it's crafted from recycled materials on the outside the car sits rather nicely with a proper tough little stance the 17-in wheels are pushed out into the edges front rear the lighting looks familiar yet fresh and the whole thing is simultaneously clearly a Fiat 500 yet it's still new power-wise don't expect to be blown away here you've got a singular electric motor producing 118 horsepower and 162 lbet of torque I suspect that torque will feel fun and Lively enough given the curb weight plus the driving Dynamic should be mildly entertaining with the center of gravity sitting nice and low thanks to the battery pack still be ready for a zero to 60 run that takes 8 1/2 seconds Fiat fits the car with three driving modes normal range and Sherpa in normal it's well normal switch to range and you get one pedal driving as the brake regen ramps way up to return more energy back to the battery pack when possible finally Sherpa is a Max efficiency mode that actually reduces your top speed to 50 mph and cuts the available power as well you can get full power as needed if you fully press the thrott botel or the you know accelerator Sherpa sounds like a desperate driving mode for desperate times some of you will think that's necessary even with a full charge since the range is listed at 149 miles sounds low sure but for those living in places where this vehicle makes sense it's fine as an urban Runabout there's plenty of range if you need to routinely drive further than that then yes it doesn't make sense for you but we as a nation of car driving folks are on average routinely overestimating how much we're out there driving our vehicles when you do need to charge up though the 500e can do so quickly with the ability to handle up to 85 Kow that will give you up to 31 miles in just 5 minutes but if you're buying one of these and you have room to charge at home Fiat includes a home charger box system or you can get charging credits with free to move charge what I find most interesting however is that this is the first full Bev from stantis that is almost shocking that we haven't had a fully electric vehicle from the many Brands under this family umbrella here in North America there are a few Maserati options coming Jeep is working on some stuff too and we know the next gen charger will have an EV option but I still can't believe we haven't had a stellantis Bev yet I mean not counting the former 500e since that came about before stellantis was actually a thing I guess regardless this one seems like the perfect about town commuter EV for someone who isn't shuttling a large family around or hauling Lumber to work the first model Fiat is launching is this red Edition it gets red side mirrors the diamond cut alloy wheels a red dashboard and have you seen the paintwork the starting price is $34,900 e not in a traditional manner but with product drops like a new sneaker that I know I'm not going to win on the sneakers app the idea is to create different versions of the car and then offer those versions for a limited time via this drop model honestly that sounds a little Annoying and a bit insane for something that costs over $3,000 but people do get excited by stuff when it's sold in limited batches like this so who knows H I need to see what's dropping next on the sneakers app actually [Music] [Laughter]"
CYsKSywBIys,Fiat 500e: We name the models to choose and which to AVOID! / Electrifying,Electrifying,so the Fiat 500 is one of the most affordable electric cars out there but it does have one luxury that other EVS don't and that is Choice perhaps a little bit too much choice but don't worry because in this new series the one that you want we are here to help and decide what is the best option for you so what do I mean by too much Choice well there are different battery sizes trim levels and uniquely a Cabrio version now our charms across the channel also get a clever three plus one variant which has an extra door on the passenger side now we don't get that though because it would mean your kids would climb out into traffic in the UK which is not a good idea okay well let's start off with the most affordable of the bunch and it is this one it's called The 500 action not the Lights and Camera variety but the Fiat one anyway this is a small car and consequently it has a small battery and that means it has a list price of 23 495 pounds which means this is officially the cheapest electric car you can buy right now if you exclude the fact that you might be able to buy a CIA me or a VW up for less but forget that you don't want one of those you want one of these so technically this is the cheapest electric car on the market oh and unless you don't include the research an army as well but that's not a car is it that's more like a four-wheeled mammal or something like that actually and rather awkwardly since it's the car that Fiat sent us you can't actually order the action at the moment either but we are promised that it will make a return once somebody finds some more semiconductors at the factory anyway if you could buy this car you'd find it has a 24 kilowatt hour battery Which is less than half the size of a pack in a Vauxhall Corsa e and a third of the capacity of something like the Kia ee6 that gives it an official 115 mile range but that will be double digits in the real world and you'll feel like you need to charge every time you stop unless you're in a town of course and just pootling about in which case you might be fine but it is going to limit its appeal now I do most of my driving in town but it would be nice to have the option to go further afield occasionally or not have to charge it every night now once I've added in all of those options the action actually comes out pretty close in price to a better equipped model with a bigger battery so let's take a look at those options next up in the range there are two models which are the same price 29 435 pounds and share a 42 kilowatt-hour battery which gives a much more sensible 199 mile official range the two models are quite different in filo first there's the brackets red which you can actually have in different colors but it will always have red bits somewhere including should you want it on the driver's seat yep just the driver's seat the rest of the Interior will be black so it looks like you bought it from a scrap yard after having a little uh biological accident anyway red is in fact a charity setup by U2 singer Bono to help fight against any health crises around the world including the pandemic and actually Fiat make a donation for every red cart that is sold which is very nice of them and if it is a beautiful day then you can actually buy the Cabrio but it is going to set you back an extra 2 650 quid both the hardtop and Cabrio also have what is called a Fiat red Kit which kind of fits in with the anti-pandemic theme as it has a cabin air filter antibacterial treatments on the interior surfaces a hand sanitizer dispenser yes really it also has a smaller 16 inch wheels which mean a lovely comfortable ride and cheaper tires at the expense of some steering feel and The Bling looks if red isn't your bag and you can live with the guilts of not donating to Bono then there is the icon model which is exactly the same price but instead of the colored bits and the hand sanitizer you get keyless entry so you don't have to take the key out of your pocket or handbag at any time stump up 31 435 pounds that's two grand more than the other pair and you can have a car with one of the longest names in history it's called the new 500 La Prima by Bocelli which will add about half an hour to every conversation when you're trying to get insurance quotes anyway this lets people know you have spent extra cash with its pretty 17-inch Alloys if they look closer they might also spot what are called premium Interiors an LED infinity light and JBL branded premium audio system which has been set up by a tenor called Andrea Bocelli no not that sort of tenor so that is a lot of choice and what's you like is probably going to be different to what I like I think personally for me I do like all the funky bits of the red however I would give that up for keyless entry because that is just a win for me every time and then I'd probably have to put a little bit of money in the charity pot to relieve my guilt the new 500 La Prima by Bocelli looks lovely but I'm not sure I could justify the extra cost I might be tempted to spend the money on the Cabrio though especially if the song comes out well hopefully that's everything you need to know about making the choice that when buying a Fiat 500 but if you're still not sure fear not head over to electrify.com because we've got even more advice on the site do let us know in the comments below if you agree with my decision or perhaps you have your own 500 and you've got a different one tell us why you made that choice thank you so much for watching and remember to subscribe to our Channel we really do appreciate your support
xw4eNfLm0EI,Fiat 500e Electric 2022 Full Review | Should You Get One?,SHETALKSCARS,when fiat first launched the 500 in 1957 it was an instant hit it was created to be a car of the people one of the world's first true city cars it was small easy to drive and economical to buy and run fast forward 65 years and the fiat 500 is still one of the best small city cars and now one of the best electric city cars is it one of the best it's definitely up there you can get the new fully electric 500 as a hatchback or a convertible it's now longer taller and wider than its petrol equivalent it keeps its iconic retro looks but with some modern style updates i've noticed it's got some returning retro features as well nostalgic of a 1957 model and look at this it's got his own side indicators back well kind of they've changed shapes is 57 there they've also brought back the old suicide doors in the three plus one version that they've got in europe sadly it's not available for us right and drivers here in the uk though it's still got its same family face but it's not smiling so much anymore it's got a lot more sass now with those eyes which are halogen you've also got daytime running lights too which are led on all specs you've got this lovely 500 badge here at the front which is new and you've also got this these new streamlined door handles which are electric and i actually really prefer the look of this it's really streamlined so more aerodynamic this particular model has got the upgraded 17-inch alloys which i really like they're an optional extra but this car is standard which is icon spec will come with 16-inch alloys you've got a choice of 15 to 17-inch alloys across the range around the back you've got the new fiat badge you've also got the new v500 electric badge which has been created specifically the electric version of the 500 you've also got these led rear lights as standard i really love the colorways that fiat has gone with for the fiat 500e there's six colors to choose from this one is an optional extra which will cost you about 600 pounds it's called the ocean green metallic and it matches my jacket it comes in white as standard and it's got this really beautiful quite expensive tri-color option too which looks really like 90s i love it the entry level option has got a 78 kilowatt motor with a smaller battery it's going to give you 93 horsepower and up to 180 miles of range which is not bad it can do zero to eighty percent charge on a 50 kilowatt fast charger in just 30 minutes which is good on a home seven kilowatt wall box you're looking at about four hours for a full charge the other option is the bigger 85 kilowatt motor with a bigger battery it'll give you up to 199 miles of range and 118 horsepower which is good it will charge on a 50 kilowatt fast charger from 0 to 80 in about an hour which is really good and that is actually true because i charge it yesterday and it was so quick and easy it will charge on a seven kilowatt wall box in about six hours that's really good this particular model is the 85 kilowatt version it's surprisingly nippy and it holds its range really well it's got more range than the bw e up the mini electric and the hungary the renault zoe is to lean the way though when it comes to range but what i will say is the 500 e has got a four star end cap rating if you know what i mean anyway let me show you what it's like inside electric car design is really challenging our perceptions of what we really need when it comes to car design gear sticks no traditional grille no the hundred has got no side mirrors and the fiat 500e has got no door handles look you just press a button to open the door it actually works pretty well there's also a little nod to its heritage here too made in torino serena is where fiat was founded and it's also where the first fiat 500 was made so it's going back to its roots i love these little touches in the front the car actually feels quite spacious you don't feel cramped or claustrophobic the rear seats are a different story though not much room back here unless you're a child or a small animal but headphones good and in the boot it's small too you get 185 liters which is not the best it is bigger than the honda either but smaller than the rest of its rivals it's big enough to pop your charging back though and some shopping i really really love this charging bag the interior is actually really nice you've got this corrugated effect dash which comes as part of style pack it's really smart you've got four different trim levels to choose from you've got the action spec which is the entry-level version followed by red icon which is this one and you've got laprima prices start from just under 24 000 pounds and that's for the entry-level action model with the 70 kilowatt motor if you opt for the entry-level version though the action spec you don't get this touchscreen instead you get a cradle for your phone which when you're spending nearly 24 000 pounds seems crazy you'll have to get red trim level or higher if you want the touchscreen but what you will get is 15-inch alloys rear parking sensors you'll also get this full of digital dash which gives you really handy trip infer when you turn your car off upgrade to the red trim level which is priced from 25 835 pounds and you get a lot more as standard including the touchscreen red exterior and interior trims wireless carplay cruise control and upgraded alloys the red trim is a collaboration with an organisation called red who fight global health emergencies like aids and curvid this particular car is the icon trim which starts from just under 29 000 pounds you'll get 16 inch alloys wireless apple carplay android auto an extra usb port and the higher powered motor the prima is a top spec priced from 30 835 pounds which will give you 17 inch alloys fixed panoramic roof beautiful birge eco leather embossed seat which i absolutely love adaptive cruise control front armrest and blind spot monitor there's a decent choice of options that you can actually spec on this car this particular car has got over three thousand pounds of options so it can all add up but you can spend less than half of that to get the good stuff my recommendations of which optional extras to spec is in the description below down here you get a bit of storage space for your phone you purse your little bits but this particular car's got the optional wireless charging pad which is in a really good spot you also got this usb port here you've got physical controls for your heating which i really like you've got an option to use your touchscreen as well but i really love the fact that it's got the option of physical buttons and look at this no gear stick nope instead we've got gear buttons you've got park reverse neutral and drive it's so easy and there's no lag between them either all electric cars are automatic at the moment and most just have one gear so there's no need for a gear stick anymore weird isn't it down here you've got this center console kind of thing you've got your drive mode selectors you've got your electric parking brake and you've got your volume control you've also got this area here which has got a usb port a 12 volt socket and a place that you need to pop your key to charge it you've also got a cup holder here and look at this you've got another cup holder which pops out the steering wheel is a subtle nod to its heritage it's this lovely two-spot design and it's multi-function i would have liked to track change a button though the seats are really comfy and they're manually adjustable they're actually made with recycled plastic from the sea too which i think is really cool you don't get carpet mats as standard which is disappointing you only get that with top spec la prima spec let me show you how she drives many people have underestimated me at the lights and the feat of 50d the 85 kilowatt version is actually really nippy it's got enough power to do a stint on the motorway and it won't let you down overtaking or up the lights in my opinion this car performs best when it's doing short trips around town going under 50 miles per hour it's got three different drive modes normal mode which is uh normal and it's got two other modes range and sherpa which give you this braking regeneration one pedal braking which is really good just pop it on now just flick that button and now i'm in range mode and straight away as soon as you let off the accelerator it starts to break for you which helps you to put energy back into the battery prolonging your range which is really good i really love sherpa mode though if you pop down into that it will restrict you up to 50 miles per hour but it'll also turn off some features which are draining the battery so it helps you really make the most of your range i think that is a really clever feature i really like it it's a lot of fun to drive there's actually a lot of things i prefer about the fiat 500d over the laundry the range the price the drive sorry i still love you but i'm not quite sure why so here's what i love about it the range the range is really good making it one of the best in its class thanks to the one pedal braking system and sherpa mode which is really clever it actually manages to hold on to its range unlike some of its competitors it's nippy and fun to drive the 118 horsepower version is a lot of fun it can keep up on the motorway and you've got no issues overtaking the steering is light but it's not a deal breaker it's really easy to live with charging is a doddle it's really quick to charge it and you can do zero to 80 in a really short amount of time it's super quick so here's the stuff that i don't like the price yep i can't ignore the price because it's a lot of money for a four-seater and the fact that you don't get a touchscreen in 2022 for nearly 24 000 pounds it's just not on you don't get a lot of tech as standard which i can kind of understand that's the electric market at the minute but still it would be nice to have maltek as standard i mean this particular car is over 33 000 pounds because of all the optional extras at this price point you'd expect a lot more bang for your buck [Music] the creepy clown noise when you turn it off overall i really liked the fiat 500e i think it's a great contender in the small electric car category and it's definitely got the edge especially in terms of range over a lot of its rivals so what do you think to the fully electric fiat 500 would you have one would you have it over its rivals the hundred of the reddit zoe let me know in the comments below and don't forget to like and subscribe for more amazing car content if i do say so myself
crllgvMRSaM,Fiat 500e - is this Britain's best value EV convertible?,Quentin Willson,thank you [Music] for those of you who haven't got time to watch this until the very end let me very quickly sum up what I think about the electric Fiat 500 it is pretty beautifully designed has great range good performance a fantastic operating and infotainment system and is very probably one of the best Fiats ever made and I included that the original cinquecento of 1957. it's also right now Great Value and you never thought you'd hear me say that did you but I'll go even further than that and say this is one of the most entertaining small electric cars you can buy and one of my favorite EVS I give it 10 stars out of five and here is why Fiat has just launched its e-grant which gives you three grand off the list price that means the entry level price with the smaller 24 kilowatt hour battery is now 25 195 pounds rising to 28 195 for the 40 kilowatt hour version and the convertible version I'm testing is 34 195 which I think makes it Britain's cheapest electric convertible I'd always advise you to go for the bigger 42 kilowatt hour battery with its claimed 199 mile range and that's pretty near The Real World Range I've been driving this in 30 degree blazing Dune sunshine this week and I've got 175 miles to one charge which for a tiny City car isn't bad [Music] and it is an absolute puppet to drive 60 in eight in a bit seconds might not sound that fast these days but it's plenty for the city and you see 30 in three seconds top speed is a decent 93 miles an hour the Turning circle is Tiny the steering is beautifully weighted and there are three driving modes normal for well normal range for when you want to harvest energy from your regen brakes and put it back into the battery and Sherpa which is for those trouser wetting moments when you need every amp and Watt that's left in the battery but look in 250 miles of driving this week I haven't even come close what it isn't is a full-sized family car the rear seats are for really small uncomplaining children the back windows don't open there's limited rear Headroom and the boot while out there for a few shopping bags won't take many suitcases to the airport although they do fold down but what makes the 500e so much better than the Honda e electric mini and Renault Zoe are all those little touches that mean so much cruise control aircon beautifully detailed interior parking sensors car play Blind Spot warnings and a really proper user interface this is a small car that thinks it's a big one but then the world never has and never will by a Fiat 500 as a family motor well maybe they did back in 1957 but not since we've all got much taller and much much fatter this is a town go-kart for two [Music] many I was genuinely embarrassed having to spend five minutes trying to find the radio controls which are down here the volume clearly labeled it has to be saved but not where you expect it some of the Interior Plastics could be a bit better and it makes a very weird slightly creepy noise as you turn it off and turn it on listen but apart from that I'm genuinely I'm carping it's a top little car this is so much better than the combustion car it replaces in every imaginable way but perhaps its greatest achievement is that it's an all-new ground up platform not based on anything else and Fiat have so respected all that cinquecento 1957 loveliness with such deep deep deep respect and we love it for that it's also the best small electric car money can buy Full Stop and a sentence rule off
pMJ2fEhN-Vc,Fiat 500e Real World Electric Road Test - Is it any good in rural Wales? With bonus furniture...,HubNut,in this video we're going to do a thorough road test typical hub nut style on the Fiat 500e this car is provided to us by onto so go and check out my previous video I'll put a link around here somewhere oh you're watching on a Telly oh that doesn't work you'll have to look to the description but yeah basically it's the car you subscribe to brand new electric car the Fiat 500e looks like it's based on the same platform as the regular petrol Fiat 500 but it isn't this is an all new platform this car is built into in and uh owes very little to the current petrol models which I think they're slowly starting to phase out obviously The Styling is still very very um Fiat 500 so you come around the back you've got the same sort of cramped little rear end but some lovely little details kind of everywhere you look really nice it's fairly evident where the charger flap is at the moment we are charging this vehicle right now on a BP charge master and part of their pulse Network we're just coming up to 80 charge after 37 minutes here so that's all good we've had rain which has prevented us from filming but yeah the car itself I love the styling of it I know not everyone's into these retro cars obviously it is nowhere near as Tiny as the Fiat 500 Nova on witchy Apes so successfully with its styling but yeah I really like it lovely details these are daytime running lights here we've got halogen headlamps but on the higher spec models this is an icon apparently you can have LEDs which seems a very sensible upgrade on an EV and we've got big 500 here they've just announced while we've been testing this vehicle they're doing an AB off version which has a bar for written across the front that looks a little ungainly to me we'll have a quick peek under the Bonnet because there is actually stuff to see under there if I remember how to unlock the bonnet be on the passenger side it's foreign oh it looks like we just upset the charging by opening this perhaps because there's a lot of electricity flowing into here at the moment so here is the the little electric motor I forgotten the power output I will apply that somewhere single speed gearbox driving in the front wheels but as you can see you can actually see stuff it's not all hidden under plastic so there is a coolant system um just to keep I think the battery can be cooled and also for the motor itself so got it charging again it is absolutely filthy this car we've already covered um about 290 miles I think since um getting this car it's an electronic release on boot lid the boot is fairly small but it's very easy to fold the rear seats should you need more space tiny tiny little parcel shelf and we've also got some charge cables in here I'm going to do a separate video on charge cables this is our type 2 and then under the floor here we've got what's known as the granny cable no spare tire of course we've got the magic goo and the tire inflator which hopefully we will not need so not a very big boot and one thing I like especially if you come around to this sort of angle I don't like how close these rear head restraints are to the rear window very good safety standards but that looks a bit close for my liking so here we are inside the Fiat we haven't done the door test yet you've got a button to open its electronic release sends nice high quality there's a manual override just down there in case things go A bit Fiat so um reassuring I know people can send in the comments about that but there isn't a manual override on the outside so but inferior door should open up I think in the event of a collision I don't know we're not going to test that please let's not take that but yeah usual fairly modern cars buttons everywhere but I will say I really like having manual heater controls the only problem being that you don't see any heater display to tell you what's going on until you turn the engine on oh excuse me that'll be radio one you've got to have a message to ignore so yeah this is the screen which shows you what's using what power it's quite hard to capture the um yeah it's a bit dark at the moment um turn on vehicle to use climate controls I just did turn the vehicle on there we go now we're ready to drive so yeah your usual display all sorts of things on here media um so that's what's playing but you've got dab um Android auto as well so it'll link to my phone so uh that's that's lovely Rod but not now there we go so yeah all your comfort settings various menus to play around in what we really need is a teenager to demonstrate yeah that's completely sussed but uh yeah it works um really quite well it's a good size the icon is the trim level that gets this first I think the bottom of the Range model doesn't get this and there's also a um lower spec battery so this has got the 42 kilowatt hour battery which makes a huge difference to your range but yeah it's just really nice I like the layout one thing I don't like so much you look at the stalks uh we've got it's a little rotating switch within the stalk so that switches between headlights on and auto mode and and then there's that button that I show a bit later on because we're recording this way out of sequence it's been one of those days I've demonstrated the skyline here we haven't no I think that must be the skyline if you're in come in that's so pretty yeah I think that's what that is and then if you look in your um door grab there's a bottle of water no well you can look oh a door grab sorry I think should say Torino in there little Fiat 500. the original Nova type I've seen the waiver Nova is the Italian electronic handbrake um as you'd expect and turn the aircon off for a minute so we've got a nice bit of Silence uh so that flicks between the different modes we're in Sherpa at the moment I can flick that up and then a little display comes up on here sorry pause I was in my own world there and uh yeah then I can put it into normal but I think we're going to keep it in Sherpa mode which is I seems to get us a good race yeah yeah it's the most efficient mode so yeah there's menus buttons you could be here for a month but uh you know they've got a little volume control on the back of the steering wheel so there are buttons on the back as well and you can change the look of this display and things so there's a lot you can do I will just say that returning to these fiddly little toggles on the wiper stalk s you've got the rear wiper on there that is really fussy to use it's a pushback for the um uh rear wiper wash but to operate the wiper settings you have to twist this little thing and that's surprisingly irritating Auto wipers absolutely terrible don't even bother with them they're they're not great I mean there's water on the screen now it's on a wipe no so yeah not the best but overall I have to say I like the design in here with this little body color panel quality yeah yeah it feels really nice and uh everything I need to drive down the road seems to work really really well and even sort of reads out your text messages so you can actually reply to your text messages by speaking therefore I've actually replied to one yet but I have listened to it no we have have we only basically yeah oh yeah yeah thank you but yeah the rear I was going to test the rear seats but uh in typical hub nut fashion things we've got a bit out of hand and we've ended up buying some furniture and quite a lot of Christmas shopping okay so if you um have seen we have a ladder ax system at home no I did not buy it I've had it for many many years and I was given it before they were trendy well after they were trendy the first time and before they got trendy again but we've just found this nest of tables and I could wee I'm so excited um it's not ladder X or G planner like holy Moses it is gorgeous I will have to show you properly on the old Twitter but um since we're doing quite well as a load lover um it's not bad for what it's a tiny little car obviously the booth is very very swiftly overwhelmed by coffee tables and multiple bags of shopping but uh in terms of what we've got down here single cup holder here but obviously you could store sort of bottles and stuff here 's in the door yep as well coming back here again we've got a 12 volt power outlet if you're a bit old school and want to use what was once the cigarette lighter in the olden days type c there which I'm using to charge my phone or straight USB and there's another USB port here as well on the dashboard um so there's another one there and you can have your phone that's a nice face yeah it's a nice little space yeah indicators very interesting indicator noises like almost a double click very grandfather clock-esque and I think for a modern car that's not a bad sound at all but yeah really stylish I think theoretically that's the phone charger didn't we yeah we thought so we don't seem to want to do anything on it that's got a key on it I don't know what that means so it doesn't work wirelessly but I won't hold that against it I wasn't expecting it but yeah I just like the driving position there's a bit of intrusion from what I presume is the heater control or heater unit here but there is somewhere to rest my clutch foot and uh yeah I've done quite a lot of miles in this car and it's nice and comfortable I believe the seat upholstery may be made from recycled bottles you did mention that which is nice but uh yeah very nice let's let's see what it's like on the road before we filled it with stuff in terms of Driving Experience um yeah it's kind of mostly good it's a lovely car to drive because of course it's so smooth and quiet which is not something you generally associate with small cars we've actually got sunshine today which is most unheard of but we have been driving this car in the cold and in the rain and obviously that does effect um your your economy but if we take a quick look at the dashboard we've got the um power mode display so at the moment we're using 13 kilowatts to climb this hill we've not got the climate control on at all at the moment not sure we need it ever so much today okay today yeah but when when it's cold that that's sapping two kilowatts so if you've got that on for two hours that's two kilowatts we're doing about 3.8 miles per kilowatt hour so you're kind of losing eight miles for every hour you have the heater on so it it is a hard time of year temperature also affects the battery chemistry so the car will be using some of its energy to recharge oh so not recharge to warm the battery to keep it a prime temperature and I'm going camping with my uh phone recently it really really got upset and 67 battery just disappeared to nothing in no time at all with the overnight temperatures so that affects these cars as well but yeah the overall driving Impressions is just lovely and I get horribly addicted to the regen braking I'm currently driving in Sherpa mode there are free driving modes in the electric Fiat 500 there's just drive um which drives very much like a normal automatic so you lift your foot off and it kind of freewheels very easily then there's range which brings in the one pedal driving and what that means is the throttle pedal you use it not just to control the accelerator but also to control the regen braking so the last bit of travel on the pedal starts acting more like a brake pedal so the more you lift off the harder the car will slow down and you sort of ease off not so much to try and smooth out that slowing down and I really like that I get so used to it this car will come to a complete stop with the one pedal driving so once it detects that the regen isn't strong enough it will actually apply the brakes itself which the people who follow my channel is probably absolutely terrifying but it works quite well so we're currently starting to put some juice back into the battery as we go downhill and that is something I love so we're not using the service break I'm just controlling that my foot isn't completely off the pedal so I'm controlling that so the regen doesn't slow us down from our 13 mile an hour speed at the moment and yeah it's just one it's the thing I've always loved about electric vehicles I know this car has caused some upset on the channel but uh the truth is I've always loved electric cars and electric cars have always featured on this channel from time to time what side of road can be a little bouncy and we can cut to some footage of it being particularly bouncy on a particularly bouncy Lane yeah you want to check out the triangle of Doom over here you probably can't see it very well Against the Sky with the bubbling no but I'm going to accelerate now up to the speed limit we're in Sherpa mode at the moment Sherpa mode dulls the throttle response so we're not getting that big kick when you put your foot down it's deliberately trying to maximize the range because we've got to get to our breast with today we should still arrive there with a good 10 12 miles left in the tank but don't don't really want to chance it too much I'm gonna have to put the climate control on though because we are starting to steam up a bit and it's probably better to put the climate control on than to use the than to open a window for ventilation which would destroy the aerodynamics so in this Sherpa mode it normally turns off the the heating entirely just again to try and boost the range but a bit of climate control is really necessary and we've kept the clung control on temperature about 20 degrees so it's nice and comfortable we've done that through eight hour testing in this car when I um just over a weekend to this test and we've covered somewhere in a region only two weeks in good grief okay we're two weeks into this test and we've covered about 260 miles [Music] um since the car was dropped off with us uh We've rapidly charged it twice I think and we have a recipe for Marvin I gave it a little trickle charge yesterday while I was up at the unit but that only put a couple of percent in uh we were going to do a separate video about all the different charge cables and what they mean and what the rates are so that'll come in a separate video but uh yeah charging on a 13 amp plug is possible but uh not recommended uh one thing that does annoy me I'm gonna do it now is turn off the lane departure control because uh on on country roads it's kind of inevitable you drift to the um across the line sometimes it's just you know how it happens around here and the car doesn't like that it shakes a warning but it will also steer the car if it thinks you're drifting off course and that's fine on a Motorway but around here it just doesn't work it's really irritating and you can't turn it off permanently you have to turn it off every time you get in the car by pressing the end of the indicator stalk here that is an annoying and the Collision detects avoidance whatever it will automatically slam the brakes on or at least give you a warning and then slam the brakes on if it detects you're about to have a collision uh there's been a few times that's pinged up and said not working so it must just be the sensor has got I don't know I don't know if it's steamed up there's a little camera in this unit up here and again we've got that lovely silence as you come to a stop I haven't touched a brake pedal at all and away we go nice and smoothly it's like the very best automatic you could ever drive because it's just seamless energy and you know when you put your foot down this thing will get a move on and that's worth saying in Sherpa mode we are limited to 50 miles an hour but if I really put my foot down it will still go and accelerate beyond that so if you're worried about the safety of your vehicle only doing 50. um I'm not sure how many scenarios you'd want to accelerate rapidly out of the way or something but you can actually do that and we'll demonstrate that once we actually get up to a national speed limit sign we are getting closer and closer so even though I'm in Sherpa mode we get to National speed limit so maybe we'll go around the bend first and they'll give it a beautiful yeah it's no telling me it's doing a driver override so it's like whoa you've just overridden me trying to save your range so we won't do that too often especially as we're already down to 25 uh on the battery so we'll leave it in chirping mode it'll stick to 50 miles an hour it extends the range ensures will comfortably get to our charger but yeah I really like it in terms of overall consumption as I mentioned we're doing 3.8 miles per kilowatt hour at this time of year and uh yeah that's um that's okay I think for this time of year a lot of energy being used by that heater look it's burning two kilowatts again at the moment so you you can reduce that consumption by turning the temperature down a bit or by only using the climate control when you really need to but the main thing is battering your batteries could always be the motor so the smoother you drive the further your range is extended it's really good for smoothing out your driving I think because it's so smooth to drive anyway it makes you really want to sort of smooth everything out as much as possible and that benefits economy so that's good in terms of windscreen wipers we better do a test of those look at that plenty of jets perhaps too many jets a bit of a triangular Doom going on over on this side though so the um the passenger blade does not quite Meet The Sweep of the drivers but I have to say the wipers work very nicely the auto wipers are a little slow you can't adjust the sensitivity what about the beer wiper we can have a look at the rear wiper if you want I shall give it a wash and listen yeah the children find that absolutely hilarious they're just gonna go it's almost like a squashed frog yeah so that could be better but uh yeah the real wife of work as well it's only a little one because it's a fairly little rear window I will say the rear three-quarter Vision when you're trying to reverse especially at night it's not brilliant but the mirrors are huge and very helpful but yeah the steering's a nice weight I particularly like this fake leather steering wheel it just feels really nice in the hand and there aren't any other controls really you have to touch very often you touch the throttle pedal and the steering wheel and that's kind of it do quite like having the row of um gear positions down here on the dashboard I think that's quite nice and with the one pedal driving you can come to a stop without touching the brake pedal and select the opposite direction it works really nicely but it's just been easy hasn't it you don't have to walk yeah yeah I mean so many of our local trips a normal car is not even getting the oil up to temperature so yeah it's ideal and also at this time of year you know you get into it most of our cars it's cold whereas this heats up in absolutely no time at all yeah and there's something I will add if you have the benefit of charging at home which we don't that's something that makes this test extra interesting I think you you pre-condition the car so you warm it up while it's still plugged into the mates so that that used to be appealing because your home electricity would be so cheap but uh no yeah that's changing somewhat yeah so I mean a lot of people say oh you know electric vehicles don't work on cost grounds and that very much depends where your electricity is coming from and other people say it doesn't work on environmental grounds and to be honest neither of those are why I'm interested in electric cars I'm interested in electric cars for the way they drive and I know it seems anti-petual head to enjoy something that makes no noise there is no apart from a little wine every now and then there is very little to tell you anything is powering this vehicle it kind of almost feels like you're on a tow rope behind another car I I still absolutely love it I love the regen and uh I just love how smooth it all feels and get some more regen as we start coming down into our air on look at that I mean the difficulty for us with regards to aside from money is um it's the network for us yeah but if we were to get an electric car we would plan our shopping you know yeah once a week we we go to a major town which is where we made it down yeah but yeah we would change that we'd go to aborough Swift or we'd go to carmarthen yeah because that's where the chance probably is closer yeah our scenario is not really typical for most EV owners although there's quite a lot of EVS around this area so people are making it work but I think there's a lot of people with their own charges yeah yeah the lack of roughly charges around here is still a bit of a bone of contention and the problem with um onto is their charge Partners there's only one charger within 25 miles of our home and we're heading to it now we got blocked last time there was someone already charging on it uh we're hoping for better luck today but uh there's no guarantee we're going to get better luck but yeah the screen works well the stereo is decent the kids seem to enjoy dark so I'm very happy connecting their gadgets to it and controlling what we listen to as we drove along absolutely uh there is one slight downside though you have to go for a higher spec if you want rear speakers we only seem to have speakers in the front and it's a good stereo and it sounds really nice you know the same feels the car but uh yeah you've got to go up the trim levels a bit if you want really good sound and then another thing is um in an electric car especially just having heated seats and steering wheel would make a huge difference I know there is a winter pack I believe for these cars they'll probably be worth investing in another thing I forgot to mention is the Turning circle is really good it actually starts um struggling for grip so tight is a turning Circle when you really get on it so yeah it turns really very nicely indeed very impressive for front-wheel drive and it does make a sort of a humming noise as you're driving along at these slower speeds so people can hear you coming what did you do in about 10 miles an hour people can hear the tire noise well the good news is we weren't blocked today no so that was good we've got a range of cards here we're currently at a BP pulse upper aberystwyth University amusingly the charger is at the top of a hill so if you're getting low on charge station it was saying Hill yeah the penguise hill if you know aberus with thankless Hill it's like very very steep but we arrived with 15 miles of range left which is slightly better than I thought which meant our 24 Mile journey to get here um used only 19 19 miles of range there's Ali but there was quite a lot of slow behind lorries and traffic jam so that just brings you energy consumption down I'm gonna take um another 40 minutes to get up to 80 but we'll probably leave it a little longer than that um technically we could go and get a coffee a good Cafe just over there I think aren't they yeah so that is an option and especially as it's a bit lunch time-ish and uh yeah we'll come back no you're not fancying it problem is others we've had so many eateries so maybe we can do better there are other charges in arborist with but they're not on the um onto Network so there's even Tesla charges Tesla Chargers are now open to all and thundering my dad charges mgzev that he's got now they're situated at city park if you're in the area where you're reading yeah and the Tesco has some charges as well which we used last time but we have to pay for those and obviously we would rather not because the whole point of the on two fingers charging is included but yeah we are at the top of a hill quite a long way from the shops unfortunately yeah this is the only one really where you struggle like when we we did charge in Tesco and you know you could go and come up come off and was the same that insta Vault was out of town wasn't it yeah but very luckily yeah next to a very delicious cafe or rather the things they did were delicious to try eating the cafe itself they were very busy so you probably shouldn't try and eat them but yeah I mean this is kind of uh issue with living in rural Wales charge points are not as easy to find as they are elsewhere so everybody are much better served um by the likes of insta vault is one of their charge Partners add them open to can change from time to time but uh yeah we shall sit here and wait for it to charge up and maybe consider lunch so in terms of rafiat claim 199 miles but that is an extremely favorable conditions uh driving around rural Wales in wintertime definitely not that but our average of 3.8 miles per kilowatt hour I think that works out at 141 miles and I'd say that's probably fairly realistic obviously we're not doing 140 miles between charges because that means taking it right down to absolute zero but you don't want to do that but uh yeah we we'll keep testing this car we've still got another two weeks and uh we'll give you some more real world mileage stats so stay tuned for that here's an annoying feature it involves windscreen wipers so obviously we must discuss it firstly the auto wipers are rubbish and take their sweet time to actually do anything and secondly if you've got the wipers the front wipers on auto but the rear wiper on intermittent the rear wiper will only go when the front wipers go but we're building up spray on the rear window it's not raining it's just you know it did rain so the road is quite wet so which I can spray all over the rear window but the rear wiper won't operate until the front wipers operate even though there's no moisture going on the front window unless traffic comes the other way and pulls it at us that's a pretty poor design and if I turn the auto wipers off on the front then the rear wiper does kick into life with a far too short intermittent gap on it which you can't adjust [Music] that that's too much that's driving me mad so uh computer trying to help and yet somehow not so there we go it's got rather dark but that is the Fiat 500e a very fine little electric car with a lot to offer I think yes there are a few niggles but I find niggles with all modern cars it isn't too um off the pace in that regard I will say I think the driver assists are actually fairly in obtrusive apart from the lane departure so that's nice I've been in other modern cars where they're constantly flashing alerts at me this doesn't do that this really does only panic at the last minute in fact I don't think I've actually managed to get it to panic yet I'm considering that a good thing but yeah a nice smooth drive the ride gets a little upset at times but generally it's absolutely fine it's actually really joyous to Potter a boat in and if you want to get a shift on it will not 69 seconds it's not bad going at all and that beautiful beautiful talk anyway thank you very much for watching there will be more coming on this car with more details on charging and that sort of thing but otherwise I shall see you in a future video farewell
JSwvQE0tgyM,New 2021 Fiat 500 e EV drive review // The Late Brake Show,The Late Brake Show,"hey actually do you know what i'm not johnny smith 
today today i'm going to be thomas shelby i'm   going to be thomas shelby in birmingham the home 
of peaky blinders with the cheeky cento blinder   i did say that and that's the reason why i'm 
dressed as such a turn-of-the-century fashionista   but the thing is is i couldn't drive this in 
italy so i brought it to birmingham because   this particular part of birmingham back in the 
1800s was known as the italian quarter little   italy where a lot of italian immigrants came and 
of course piggy blinders is filmed and set here   and the shelby family the peaky blinders were a 
real gangster family but before i go into all that   this is the bit that we need to talk about this 
is a ground-up new car and it's ever so slightly   bigger in all respects than the old 500 and it's 
going to be made in turin in italy whereas before   it was made in poland but is it any good i'm 
johnny smith welcome to the late break show   now i'm going to a couple of areas around the 
digbeth region of birmingham and that is because   that's where the italian quarter came to be around 
the early part of the 1800s people came across   from northern italy mostly because of napoleonic 
occupation and famine and they brought with them   skills of being entertainers and um precision 
workers engineers late part of the 1800s a lot   of southern italians came and congregated 
here and they brought with them things   like organ grinding skills and ice cream 
i love the fact that fiat has finally made   a 500 electric for a global audience 
because the original one that most people   have never driven came out in 2013 was only 
available weirdly in california and oregon   in the states it was made in mexico and sold in 
those parts of the states strange very strange   they had about 84 to 87 miles of range type 
one connector so quite old-school so it's 61   millimeters longer 56 millimeters wider and 22 
millimeters longer in the wheelbase in other   words there's a chance it might have a bit more 
room inside than the previous 500 which is no bad   thing the design is unmistakably 500 but they've 
made it a bit more i was going to say brutish   let's just call it less cutesy because it's not 
exactly a brutal 500 but it's got these kind of   little overlapping eyebrows with kind of a bad boy 
bonnet if you remember 90s modified cars we used   to do this the bad boy bonnet front wheel drive of 
course this is the first fiat 500 to be available   with 17-inch wheels 17s they look massive on this 
i've got the convertible version and it will be   available just like the existing 500 as a hard top 
or a or a convertible but three door only or two   door because it's the convertible this particular 
shape is only going to be available as electric so   this is going on sale alongside the existing shape 
500 that's been face lifted an awful lot in its   piston full but when that gets phased out you'll 
only be able to buy a 500 as an electric car   right let's have a look under here 
because the fiat 500 e is available in two   flavors of tune the city range and the long 
range and the difference really is motor   and battery size the city range is 70 kilowatt 
motor and the long range is 87 kilowatt motor   okay which means north to 62 is a bit slower 
for the city car nine and a half seconds to 62   versus nine seconds to 62 with the long range 
top speed is lower with the city 84 miles an hour   long range 93 miles an hour the battery partner 
for this car is samsung and apparently they've got   these interesting modules a first application 
integrating calling and additional functions   directly into the modules which allows battery 
packs to increase in energy density now what   that really means is the fact that they've 
managed to get a nice liquid cool battery pack   into quite a small place it's 42 kilowatt hours 
if you've bought the long range version and it's   23.7 kilowatt hours if you buy the city version 
what does that mean uh range wise 199 mile range   wltp for the long range and 115 miles range for 
the city car this car the car i'm testing today   is the top range car which is la prima there are 
four spec levels and we'll talk about the spec   levels in a sec but basically that means this 
is the long range car with a 42 kilowatt hour   battery pack with 199 mile range capability so 
when you set the sat nav on the electric 500 it   gives you all the charging points it's actually 
quite a high resolution bigger screen for the um   the top ranking models at this 10.25 inch rather 
than seven inch steering on 500 is always light   it's a car geared around city life which is why 
ev makes a lot of sense and although you might   discount the 23.7 kilowatt hour city range version 
that does 115 miles actually when you think about   it there's so many of these cars that just live 
in cities and don't go out beyond the city limits   which makes sense and in city use you can probably 
get more than 115 miles okay this i think is   faisaly street now back in the days of the italian 
quarter i'm pretty sure there was no laser quest i'm pretty sure yeah so just like the previous version of the 500 
the convertible isn't a true convertible in the   in the traditional sense it still has a metal 
structure on the roof it just peels back the   middle section so it'll either go back to there 
on one push or it'll go but down to there on two   pushes what it means is the roof stays bunched 
up here your rear visibility is quite bad but   it's very stylish so i'd say it's more of a sort 
of full-length mad sunroof than it is a cabrio   come and have a look inside your cheeky 
cento blinder i'm going to keep saying that   so you've got a two spoke steering wheel 
which is really similar to the honda e   the 500 badge this can be ordered as a two tone so 
of course you've got no gear shifter because it's   single speed electric so it just does prnd for 
the um the transmission just along the top here   this particular car being the high spec 
has the pad for wireless phone charging   just inside this cubby here and it has 
an embossed outline of the turin skyline   to remind you that this is made in turin and 
down here in the door handle grab there's an   embossed picture of a classic fiat 500 i used 
to have one of those and it says made in torino   and actually quite similar to the honda e 
come to think of it is this little plinth   here between the seats you've got an armrest here 
but the plinth has your e modes what your e-modes   are is your driving modes and there's three of 
them i mean normal which is what it defaults to   if i go to range mode it kind of backs off 
the top speed a little bit and it might   back off the air conditioning and stuff but 
then you've got a third mode called sherpa   which is like the get me home mode it backs 
off the top speed completely it won't let you   use the heating or the air con i don't think 
and it really dumbs down the throttle so that   is like i just want to get home i'm running 
low on power i love the fact it's called   sherpa it'll guide you home but the problem is 
i think of sherpa as a 1970s builders van the   sort of thing you'd see around here in the olden 
days not as old as piggy blinders but you know i   don't think they had cards in peaky blenders 
i know they did so i've got it in normal mode   if i stick it in range mode what i didn't mention 
before the main difference between range mode and   normal mode is you have the same amount of power 
but it's one pedal driving so it'll hold it now   and it'll bring it to a complete standstill 
using do it by just coming off the throttle   there is no regen that you can dial in dial out 
it's either range mode or normal mode where it has   very very minor regen braking so i come off the 
brake now and it's actually really aggressive   sort of like level three on my kia soul 
or maximum b on a on an e-goal for example   i think they've done a good job with this 
you know it's just good to have a bigger   i hate the term portfolio of city car size you 
know this kind of size car that's available   as an electric vehicle and it's interesting it's 
charismatic it's got a great selection of textures   and tech this particular one that i'm testing 
today is la prima trim level there's four trim   levels of the 500e action passion icon and laprima 
i'll put some details on screen of what that means   but basically this is the top one with the 
convertible option now on the right hand side   of the steering wheel these buttons here for your 
level two autonomy which is a first in this car   segment and that is lane keep assist or adaptive 
cruise control and speed limiter there are also   volume controls on the back of the wheel here and 
you can change the station so there's buttons on   the front and on the back of the wheel so if i was 
going to buy that the longer range battery pack   which this has it's higher in range capability 
than the honda e than the mini and the e up   but i would also urge you to consider the 
entry level renault zoe the zoe gets overlooked   the zoe's a really good car and with its revised 
interior and its tech lift i think it's a very   cool thing it's also exceptionally good value if 
you're looking to buy one of these what rivals are   there honda e is probably at the top of the list 
and the mini e the mini electric and there's a   couple of other little ones to consider as well 
now one of the rivals i would pit this against   would be the e up the vw e up or the skoda city 
go iv or the um the say at me but you know what   i can't really pit them against that because it 
seems that you can't really buy it anymore vw   don't necessarily want to sell it to you anymore 
they've sort of said they've they've run out of   stock or they're not replenishing stock because 
i think they're bringing in the vwi d3 and stuff   like that there's a bit it's a bit of a shame 
i might be wrong there but i would definitely   consider an e up or a um a say at me instead of 
this it's got better leg room as back passengers   if that's a thing oh look at that it's a honda crz 
hybrid i like them dude driving it's got a proper   dodgy roll up on the go windows up smoking too 
that's full commitment to the cause if you're   watching this review and you're wondering would i 
prefer a mini electric or would i prefer a honda e   well i've reviewed those both those cars in quite 
a lot of detail and i'll put the links to them up   here here's the mini one i have to say i really 
like this and then here's the honda e one if you   just take it from a style perspective this is 
the charge port on the fiat 500e on this side   it has these rubber bungs which are a 
bit fiddly because they're on long stalks   but it does have a bit of illumination in there 
and it has ccs which is your dc rapid charge on   the long range it'll charge up to 85 kilowatts 
which is about 35 minutes zero to eighty percent   and on the city range it'll do up to 50 kilowatts 
which is about 30 minutes zero to 80 percent   uh but if you want to do it on like an 11 
kilowatt wall box two and a half hours for   the city and four hours 15 for the long range even 
the convertible has a bigger boot than the honda   e this is 185 liters a honda ease 171 liter boot 
tension mini e 211 liters and the e up 250 liters   on the renault zoe's massive don't worry about 
the noise got some boys doing some digging to bury   a few things you ain't seen me 
this is interesting these are   automatic door handles where you just put your 
hand into this aperture and there's just like a   touch sensitive pad you can yeah and then there's 
a button on the inside here to just press to leave   rather than a physical handle it's neat this is 
an early car because it's left and drive straight   fresh from italy consignment that i got from 
italy all right but watch out for the rival gangs   so you've got your schedules you can schedule your 
charging when you want it to be you can set your   charging look like that or you can set your charge 
you've got five stages of charging here so you   don't have to charge it to maximum these seats on 
the higher ranking cars are really nice there's a   couple of different fabrics to choose from this 
stuff is called sql sea qual and it uses 20 uh   polyester and plastic fibers that have 
been pulled from and recycled from the sea   i believe they look great i'm a big fan of 
cloth just like the honda e has a really   interesting kind of tweed in it the 500 
looks good with a bit of imaginative tweed   isofix is quite prominent actually really 
obvious it's not covered up by anything   and there's two isofixes in the back it is a four 
seat not a five um i'm not going to sit back there   last time i sat in the back of the 500 they had 
to call for help the cabin's a great place to be   the quality of it's probably not quite as good as 
the mini and the the feel of the car it's perhaps   not quite as sharp as a mini cooper se as they 
call it the style's i think better than a mini   and the current mini electric is an 
adaptation of a piston car whereas this isn't   so theoretically this should be a better tool 
for the job i'm really enjoying it so far i'm   very much enjoying it would i rather be sat in a 
hungary the honda e is just one of those damn cars there's only one range version to choose from 
which is disappointing but you still want it   you still want it i keep wanting the honda even 
though the range is not great 137 miles at best   i would be really surprised if this car doesn't 
sell well the most important thing for fiat is to   get bums in seats of existing 500 drivers who are 
used to driving a non-electric 500 a piston 500   and they want to taste what it's like going 
into the world of evie and that's precisely   what i think is vital to broaden 
their kind of appeal of evs yeah that's that's okay it's like a laptop but the 
turn off just sounds like either a strange circus   fun fare or a sorry ice cream van an italian ice 
cream bun of course okay fiat 500e where am i at   with it is it a cheeky cento blinder i do actually 
think the fca group has done a fantastic job of it   i think it translates to an ev really well 
you've got the two battery sizes i think for me   i would want the bigger battery the 42 kilowatt 
hour which makes it a better range car than the   mini which makes it a better car range than 
the honda e but then there's the problem   it's in the danger zone of being priced 
near the base model honda e and i think   what a car what a car it's so enjoyable but what 
this does i think this will draw a bigger crowd   ultimately and a crowd that maybe wouldn't 
have looked at an electric car beforehand   i think it's that right level of 
sort of quality for the money as well   the mini is a more luxurious feeling car inside 
and probably a little bit more enjoyable to drive   but the honda e has my attention in terms of 
design overall it's a really difficult verdict   i'm not gonna lie what i would say though   is try this and try the mini and try the handy 
and look at the zoe as well because they're   all fantastic cars what this ultimately does is 
expands the interest in this kind of size of car   as a full ev to a wider market and that's what 
i want a wider adoption of electric vehicles it's not a very good verdict is it but that's the 
one you're gonna get thanks for watching if you   have already subscribed thanks for subscribing

brvvaWzs63Y,2021 Fiat 500e Review - Under-hyped electric city car? TESTDRIVE (La Prima cabriolet) UK 4K,Auto Social UK,as time goes on i'm finding myself getting more and more excited for brands electric car offerings but an electric car has to be one of two things for me it either has to be super fast or super quirky now there's one brand that does quirky so well and that has to be fiat they've got a rich history of creating some really fun and funky city cars now under here is a car that i don't think there's been near enough as much hype as i would have expected under here is the all-new electric fiat 500 but before i reveal all if you're just finding my channel now and you like new car reviews please don't forget to go ahead and hit the subscribe button okay let's go the fiat 500e comes in the option as a 40 to hatchback or as a convertible which makes the fiat 500 the first four-seater all-electric convertible it also comes in two battery sizes which i'll elaborate on later with prices starting from just 21 000 pounds for the entry-level hatchback with a small battery however the model that i'll be driving today is the top of the range the primer which comes at premium 3495 for the soft top what i really love about the fiat 500 is it's very classic fiat but it also gets its whole own personality as you can see around the front like the honda e they've gone for a much more emotive look on the headlights which are now split into two with the almost eyebrow style daytime running lights along the top which i absolutely love you've also got a much sleeker and more prominent front badge but this is actually larger to serve a purpose behind that badge you'll actually find the brand sensor for your adaptive cruise control and also your anti-collision down the bottom you've got a very nice cut out honeycomb grille and then around the side you'll actually find the indicators protrude a little bit from the body work now as great as these look it does worry me that these might snap off but i'm sure fear have put things in place to make sure that that doesn't happen the fiat 500 electric is 60 millimeters taller and wider than the petrol model and that's to allow for the battery pack under the floor it's also 20 millimeters wider in the wheelbase allowing more space for passengers in the front which we'll go into in a bit more detail but it's still very classic fiat 500 and is nice and dinky despite that size increase which means it's going to be super simple to park now these wheels on this vp500 i absolutely love they're the perfect blend between not looking too electric but still standing out and being a little bit more special in fact these wheels look like they belong on a much more premium vehicle hang on a second i'm pretty sure they do belong on a much more premium vehicle do these remind anyone else of the wheels that they put on the mercedes eqc well anyway i think the fiat 500 wears them better again around the back the fear has some redesigned rear lights which now have a 3d effect and it wears the brand's all-new fiat badge now it might not surprise you that the boot of the fiat 500 is not its main selling point in here you'll find 115 liters of space which is more than you'll get in the honda e but is behind things like the renault zoe and also the mini of course in the convertible it does become a slightly less usable space as the opening is less wide than you'll get in the hatchback but you can still fit around three carry-on cases in the back there or your weekly shopping and i think for most people it's not going to be too much of a problem the entry-level car is the hatchback action and it's back to basics including a phone cradle instead of an infotainment screen although all cars get a digital instrument cluster the passion gets a 7-inch screen with wireless apple carplay and android auto the screen on the icon model grows to 10.25 inches and also gets satellite navigation and keyless entry and start this top specular primer gets full led affinity lights wireless phone charging and a premium interior getting inside the fit 500 everything is pretty impressive it's really high quality and it does feel quite premium but then we do have to remember that i am in the top spec la prima trim which means it has got loads of good extra goodies but in here you've got some really nice bolstered leather seats which i'm pretty sure a vegan leather and if you look at the details on them as well as having 500 stitched in you've also got this really nice fear effect stitched in the leather which i think looks super nice despite this being a small city car you actually get quite a lot of storage as well i've got storage in this armrest and i've also got storage in the center console as well of course there isn't any transmission tunnel as the fit 500 doesn't need a standard transmission it's just popped up here on the dash instead so that means that you've actually got quite a lot of space along the bottom here as well although perhaps this could have been used a little bit more there could have been even more storage in the center here you've also got loads of technology so i've got a 10.25 inch touchscreen which is the biggest touchscreen that the cars do other models get a 7-inch if you go for the base spec but i've also got adaptive cruise control wireless charging as well as so many other goodies unfortunately despite being in love with this car i do have to talk about its kryptonite and that's space in the back so let's see how easy it is to get in the back of the fiat 500 getting in isn't too bad but once you are in space is then really limited okay fair enough this seat is as far back as it will go and my knees are right up against the passenger so you definitely won't be able to fear a six foot person in the front and anyone remotely big in the back but for children i think they'll be perfectly happy back here of course there's only two seats there's no need to squeeze a third person in just for the sake of it but actually i've got a reasonable amount of arm space and because of that convertible it makes it feel a lot lighter and airier i know that as a kid i would have loved sitting in the back of a convertible and it wouldn't have bothered me if i didn't have too much space in the hatchback it is going to be much darker and it will feel a little bit more claustrophobic but if you just have those extra seats as emergencies just in case you wanted to take people in the back then i don't think it'll be a problem but if you need a four seater then this probably isn't the one to choose right we're going for a brave move we're going for a roof off because the sun has just started shining so i'm hoping fingers are crossed that i'm not going to get blown to bits now i have found something i find a little bit annoying about the fiat 500 convertible and i found this about fiat 500 before and it blows my mind so there's no mirror in the sun visor which i just find crazy because come on not a stereotype it's a girl's car girls like to touch up their lipstick make sure they look okay and they haven't popped a mirror in there which i just find a little bit disappointing however let's get going okay as absolutely beautiful as it is to have the roof down i am going to bring it forward now just so that it's not so much noise whilst i'm recording as you can see the roof will come on even at high speeds so i'm doing 50 miles per hour at the moment and i could shut the roof no problem so that's much nicer we can have a bit of a quieter chat now so the little fiat 500 electric gets the option of two different batteries one bigger than the other so the entry level is a 27.2 kilowatt battery which produces 115 miles yeah so that kind of renders it to me a little bit useless i don't know about anyone else it's going to be great for some people because it means that if it's your second car and it's just a town car and you're using it just to nip around to save on your fuel costs then it's probably going to be okay but if you want the reassurance that you can go a little bit further and take the fiat 500 on some more journeys then you're probably going to want to opt for the bigger battery which is a 47 kilowatt battery which will do 199 miles perfect now i think that's absolutely amazing because realistically i think the fiat 500 could have got away with offering just 150. after all the mini does and the honda does and yeah okay they've been blasted for it but nobody's really kicked up much of a fuss and people are still buying it so to offer this over 199 miles i think is fantastic the two different battery types also get two different power outputs but don't get too excited neither of the fiat 500s with the smaller battery or the larger battery are particularly rapid but then again when has a fiat 500 ever been about power they still sell hundreds every month and that's because people love them and they're not really fussed about how fast they go that's what the abarth is for now if you go for the smaller battery you get 95 brake horsepower and it will go from naught to 62 in 9.5 seconds if you go for the bigger battery you get 115 brake horsepower and that will reduce the naught to 62 time to nine seconds so it's still good and it's better than the petrol or diesel cars but it's not particularly rapid however because the naught to 30 time is so responsive with that torque it means that nipping around town it actually feels pretty quick and for people that like driving fiat 500s it's nice to know that you can get out of trouble pretty quickly as you can nip around with that instant power you have three different driving modes which are navigated using a rocker switch on the center console the first mode is your normal this turns down your genitive braking and gives you the best use of the power that the car has the second one is your range and as you can imagine this is used to get the best out of your range it will turn up your regenerative braking and it will just slightly reduce the power that the car has the third is a bit extreme that's your sherpa so what the sherpa mode will do is it will turn up your regenerative braking but it also turn off all of your amenities and it will limit your top speed to 50 miles per hour this is to be used in emergencies if you really need to get the best amount of range you can recharge your 500 using a 3-pin socket but that will take you all night literally you'd be better getting the optional 7.4 kilowatt wall box which will charge its batteries in a little over six hours you'll also probably want to opt for purchasing the 11 kilowatt charging cable as that will speed things up relatively good it's just a little bit of a shame that you have to pay extra for it the quickest way to put some juice in the fiat 500 is by finding a fast charger which i talk a lot about and i know they're still pretty rare but if you find something which supports 85 kilowatt charging then you can get the battery on the fiat 500 from north to 80 in under 30 minutes which is pretty impressive just like the ice cars the electric fiat 500 makes an excellent city car with its really light steering and also its small wheelbase it means that you can nip it round town with no problems the fit 500 as you can expect has got a very good little turning circle so we'll give it a go as i need to turn around yeah an absolute doddle not quite as tiny as the absolute minute turning circle of the honda re but still very very small which makes things really convenient however due to the added weight of the battery the fiat 500 does become a little bit bumpy around town it's nothing i'm finding uncomfortable and once you get out onto main roads it really does smooth down however on particularly tricky terrain you might find it just a little bit thrashy so what do you think of the all-new all-electric fiat 500 i've got a feeling that you guys are gonna love it just as much as me if i was gonna go for an electric car at the moment i feel like this convertible fiat 500 might have just topped the list if you are interested in an all-electric fiat 500 or any fiats for that matter then make sure you get in contact with motor vogue in kingsland i'll pop all the details in the description box if you've enjoyed this video go ahead and give it a massive thumbs

Uvm-FxufxP8,The New 2024 Fiat 500e Is a Sexy City-Sized EV But Is It Too Expensive To Succeed?,TFLEV,"[Music] hey guys meet the brand new 2024 Fiat 500e and of course the E stands for electric and if you know anything about the Fiat chin quento you know that it came around in 1957 as a city car and this of course is the latest version in fact Fiat has only built an electric version of the Fiat 500e and in this video we're going to take it for a ride we're going to see how it does in this Miami Heat and traffic and of course we're going to tell you whether you should buy it leas and rent it or forget it so let's hit the [Music] road now you may be wondering what does this little guy compete with and there are two cars that come to mind immediately of course the mini SE uh which is coming back with also ironically 150 miles of range uh and the bolt which is gone but you know who knows so we are coming back to a time of having small electric cars that are oh God I'm going to hate this because you guys are G me so much you know what in the comments dare I say affordable look at that there's a guy Wheeling a scooter only in Miami uh but it's nice to see that we're getting back to a time when we have and please don't crucify me in the comments air quotes relatively affordable cars because if you lease this you can get the tax credit and depending on you know the lease amount this could be something that would be a good car to have just kind of to you know run errands in or take the kids to school uh I probably wouldn't road trip it after having a road trip the mini but there is something Charming about a little car in the city easy to park easy to turn easy to own under the hood of course is an electric motor it puts out 118 horsepower and 162 lb of torque it doesn't have a transmission cuz it doesn't need one but it will do 0 to 60 in about 8.5 seconds but more importantly Fiat says it'll do 0 to 30 in enough time to make you feel queasy so let's see if that is true I'm going to make this turn and then I'm going to give it a little bit of the accelerator it's no longer the gas pedal and see how it accelerates all right here we go full on that's 30 yeah that's good not quite uh tunnel vision uh but certainly very Lively ride is very European what I mean by that is well dampened um nice firm steering good steering wheel now of course for all of you guys who drive and love EVS you'll know that really the heart of the car is no longer the motor or engine if you're into internal combustion engines but really the battery and the new 2020 2 4 Fiat 500e has a 42 KW hour battery with 38 of those Kow usable for daily driving that gives you a range of about 149 mil in the city or if you put it in range mode or Sherpa mode you can get up to 167 now it doesn't charge all that quick 85 Kow at its Max and Fiat says that you can go from zero to 80% on a level three fast charger in about 35 minutes now the experience we had when we own the competitor to this which was the mini SE which had 104 miles of range was that on a road trip you would basically drive for an hour and then charge for an hour that had a 50 Kow charger so it was a little bit slower but 85 isn't going to set the world on fire so if you're going to charge this overnight on a level two charger at home it's going to take you 6 hours if you're going to plug it into the wall 36 hours so really road tripping not so much City Driving yeah it's fine compared to the old 500d this new one is actually 2 in longer 2 in wider and 1 in taller which gives you a little bit more interior room so if you're wondering how much room there is you do have enough room for let's say two roller bags and actually this boot as the BRZ would say I wonder how you say that in Italian is actually deeper than the previous model now for those of you who don't speak British English boot is of course trunk and underneath this boot bottom is a little storage space which gives you a run flat charging set up with air and of course a charger now unfortunately in America we're not going to get a charger but we are going to get a $600 credit toward a level two charger or charging depending on which you'd prefer all right if you're wondering if this will actually work as a city family car I fear the answer is no unless you have very small kids or no feet uh as you can tell I'm 6'2 I don't have any Headroom uh I barely have room for my back because this headrest is knocking into it and if I move the seat back I think I'd need somebody very short to drive so yeah it's got a back seat but in terms of utility for anybody who's over I'd say 5'5 it's not Grand as tight as the back seat is that's as roomy as the front seat is now I can move the seat way back here and I'm probably sitting too far back actually to drive the car um so there is 2 in more in length and I suppose in the front it does matter now the wheel also telescopes and tilts which is very nice uh and if you're wondering where's my cup holder it's actually hidden right here so the Italians have even thought of that now like many electric cars uh this also has an interesting door blocking mechanism it's actually just a push button with you push and then open so making it easy to get get in and out and like any twood door the door for such a short car is very long so you might have uh you know some issues even in the parking lot because you will hit whatever you're parked next to with this big ass door like the previous generation this Fiat 500e has push button transmission which is actually simple to use and I like that they didn't reinvent the wheel now they also didn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to your HVAC controls they're real buttons so you don't have to dig in the menu if you want to say Throw Some cool air on your body versus on your feet versus you know in the defroster uh the other nice thing is you do actually have a volume knob um so it's a rotary knob that kind of works like that which is actually fine uh once you get used to it and you do have uh three uh different Drive modes uh which allow you to use normal range or Sherpa and Sherpa is basically um Extended range one pedal driving whereas normal allows the car to Coast as if you're driving a traditional internal combustion engine so you pick however you want to drive it and we'll demonstrate those once we're on the road if you're familiar with what used to be FCA Now stantis Products then you'll love the OS uh in the screen it's basically UK connect uh which I have always found to be very intuitive and easy to use also of course you get Android auto Apple carplay Alexa integration uh and it's just a system that's you know very simple uh very intuitive uh and doesn't you know make you think too hard when you're say switching from Sirius to regular radio regular radio regular radio there we go to your phone I'm in normal right now but let me change it to range mode uh the first thing you notice in range mode is that it's basically one pedal driving so I don't have to have my foot on the brake uh and it should give me more regen oh yeah I can feel it immediately and if you're familiar with driving an electric car and you have gotten used to one pedal driving this will feel very familiar uh it um it's actually a really fun way to drive if and when you kind of get accustomed to not using the brake and not making your passenger sick uh so as soon as this light turns green we'll try uh range mode yeah City Driving yeah lot of stop and stop and more stop and then more stop after that all right here we go we're going to make a right turn we get off this busy street and construction so stop construction stop stop construction so we're going to make a right here and yeah let's see what this is like and then you let off I was going to say gas pedal once again accelerator it slows down um and that works really well and then Sherpa mode oh that's interesting so with Sherpa mode you get up to 165 is miles range uh and the first thing I noticed is that it turns off uh the air conditioning and when it's 90° outside that's not a good thing so once again one pedal driving turns off the HVAC gives you a little bit less power when you floor it uh and basically makes it very uncomfortable in Miami in the spring so um you know that might be something that you guys use in the midwest uh in fall and spring now if you think the Fiat 500e is Big let me put that in perspective because this is the original 1957 chin quento not only do you have suicide doors but you have a car that is dwarfed by the new 2024 but you know the great thing about them is you can kind of see the family resemblance right you've got eyes here you've got eyes there you've got a mouth here you got a mouth there and the word that comes to mind for me is just Charming of course the original Fiat 500e electric was this one it was a California compliance car in other words it didn't have a lot of range about 87 Mi but what it lacked in range it's certainly made up in style I mean orange and white how cool is that and then if you come over here you can kind of see these like little dimples and uh these are supposed to be for aerodynamics you know like a golf ball gives you better Arrow to give you better range I'm not sure sure that worked all that well back [Music] then of course stantis loves their Easter eggs and this car is built well let me show you and you can guess where it's built at first and foremost is this which is well a little Italian flag so you can probably guess where it's built but where in Italy is it built and of course there are Easter eggs for that there is uh one right there that you can look at and there is one right there that gives it all away and in case you didn't see enough Easter eggs uh on the phone charger is another Easter egg the skyline of I spec toino which uh also doubles as a phone charger yeah how cool is that now if you're wondering if you can get your chento e is that electricity sorry bad accent with Knack in other words North American charging standard the answer is no for now the Fiat 500e comes with good old CCS until all the other manufacturers get together and switch over so U CCS it is the only kind complaint that I have is the seat is a little too firm for my big cushy American butt uh but overall you know I like little cars I have to be honest I'm a kind of a huge Fanboy of small little City cars uh and what makes this car to me very special is that it feels relatively expensive while it's relatively affordable please don't crucify me in the comments uh but I think when you see the lease rates this will be the kind of car that if you want something and if you're in New York La Chicago Miami Houston probably not uh that is electric and that does uh give you uh kind of that sense that you can zip in and out of uh traffic and do it with you know little fuss um then this is probably the car for you until the new mini SE comes out uh which will obviously directly compete with this there are two models of the new Fiat 500 this is called the red and not just because it's red the red means that you get red mirror caps you get a red logo and some other red things but you can get it in black and you can get it in white 32,500 starting with a $1,500 destination fee Ser at$ 34,000 but as face said most people will probably lease this to get the 7500 federal tax credit in which case you'll probably save a lot of money they have not yet announced lease prices but I remember the old one in California back in the day of course here comes the train give me a second it's a short train you can think about what I'm talking about all right the old one you could lease for $99 a month and I suspect uh this will be more expensive but probably not much more there's also an upper end model inspired by and that's about $36,000 and you get vegan leather is there such a thing that seems like an oxymoron but you do get vegan leather uh you get a better sound system you get kind of nicer interior uh but for me uh this red model is about perfect so as always this is Roman reporting for the fast lane car at the beginning of this video I said I'll let you know whether you should buy it lease it rented or forget it that's an easy one lease it of course that's the way you want to save as much money as possible and if you want to see all of our coverage and not just our EV coverage go to alt tf. as always I will see you next time [Music] ciaoo"
Uc4h9AgdNqw,2024 Fiat 500e electric car review: New EV city car takes on Mini Cooper Electric and GWM Ora,CarsGuide,you might not know how to look at it but this is a brand new as in properly all new Fiat 500 or cinquecento in fact it's the first all-new Fiat 500 in 16 years now so let's only surprise it's also entirely electric properly modern and it has actual technology both in its cabin and on its safety list fear reckons this acts as the kind of brand reset in Australia and that there will never be another all-new ice powered Fiat 500 ever again so let's go see how the Fiat 508 measures up now it's not cheap by modern small EV standards and yes we're looking at you China but it does arrive in one well-equipped trim level the La Prima with paint the only available option it's also quite shockingly for anyone who has driven an ice sphere 500 lately stacked with some truly high-tech kit there are heated seats up front for the first time ever for example and there's a 10.25 inch Central screen with Apple carplay and Android auto and wireless device charging there's a digital driver display 2 plus Eco leather on the seats and dash a panoramic glass roof and fancy push button front doors outside you'll find 17-inch Alloys as well as LED lighting all around including the drls it looks well it looks like a Fiat 500 doesn't it even if it has grown in every Dimension but I do love these 17-inch alloy wheels I love the hidden door handles and up front here there's this led drls which act as kind of eyebrows for the headlamps but I guess the biggest compliment I can paint is that it looks like a Fiat 500 and not some modernized eco-friendly version that's good news because this is a properly Timeless design so pretty traditional outside but definitely more modern feeling in the cabin boat with these two big screens this horizontal style gear selector and this Nifty push button door opening although with the manual back up beneath it just in case something goes wrong there are however a few questionable materials scattered around the cabin but I gotta say it all feels actually pretty nice so it's taller longer and wider than the ice Fiat 500 and it rides on a longer wheelbase all of that's courtesy of that new EV platform but we're still not talking Oodles of space back here of course especially Headroom and shoulder room in the back seat which kind of to make this a space you'd put adults that you're not all that fond of there's just a single electric motor on offer here mounted at the front which makes 87 kilowatts and 220 newton meters and that's enough for it says to knock off the Sprint to 100 kilometers an hour in around nine seconds and I know that doesn't sound very fast but by virtue of the way EVS deliver their power it does feel zippier than that when you're behind the wheel and there's also the EV standard single speed gearbox on offer here the 42 kilowatt hour battery provides the smallish 311 kilometer driving range on paper but when we got in the car it was more like 290 kilometers at about 96 charged so a city car then rather than a long distance hauler and when it does come time to charge it's set up for 85 kilowatt DC fast charging which should take you from zero to 80 full in around 35 minutes [Music] I'm just gonna put this out there I reckon this is the best driving fear 500 there has been in years and I know that's not that big a hill to climb considering that the last all-new one was 16 years ago but there's none of that dodgy dual logic automatic gearbox to worry about no need to row through the gears it's just point and shoot it's super smooth and even though the outputs don't seem massive on paper because it's only a little EV put your foot down and there is plenty of poke to get you up and moving and a zip through traffic as we were doing earlier the ride's pretty good on most surfaces as well although it can be challenged by bigger bumps in the road of course but really what they've done is create a pretty easy pretty comfortable City friendly EV which is probably exactly what a little electric car like this should be right I guess the biggest challenge this car faces though is its timing Once Upon a Time really not that long ago EVS were very expensive in Australia right but recently there's been this flood of cost-effective cheap EVS coming mostly from China some of which even play in the same kind of cutesy field as this Fiat 500 which is significantly cheaper but I guess you are kind of paying for a little bit of Heritage here too plus it is ferociously well equipped in this single trim level with all the technology you could ever really need or want and no options boxes to tick other than paint Choice there are a couple of other small quirks you notice when you ventured too far from the city too and that is that road noise can be a little bit intrusive on the wrong road surf this is not this one but the Corsa stuff does create a bit more of a hum in the cabin there's another little Quirk I've found as well that despite this being an all-new platform so basically from a blank piece of paper design the area for your feet is so tight that you've got to be really careful where you put your left foot otherwise you can accidentally clip the brake when you put your foot down you're better to sort of have your leg push right over to the left hand side which isn't all that comfortable over longer distances but honestly there is a lot to like about this all-electric fee at 500 yes it is expensive no the range isn't all that impressive but a Fiat 500 is always a car that's been bought with the heart rather than the mind right and I suspect there's going to be a lot of people whose heart tells them this is the EV for them the other benefit of a very light car with a smallish battery pack is the fact that it hasn't added Oodles of weight to this vehicle yes it's around 1.2 tons it's certainly no featherweight but it still feels pretty light on its feet and pretty Nimble the steering is nice and direct it goes around corners nicely there's not a lot of complaint from the tires and unlike in some cheaper EVS which really struggle to put their torque down into the road without the tires squealing this one just doesn't do that so I'm going to head up this hill here and flatten my foot and there's a little bit of slip there from the tires but none of that kind of scrabbling you get in some of the cheaper EVS but if you do have a family you can pretty much rule this one out your kids are going to outgrow that back seat pretty quickly and there's not much in the way of boot space either equally if you like long distance Turing this might not be the EV for you it's only set up for 85 kilowatt DC charging so not only can it not drive that far but it can't charge that fast either but that still leaves quite a few people couples older or younger people who live in the city people who simply don't drive that far people who like a car to look at that makes them feel something a carbon a little bit of Heritage well the Fiat 500e definitely ticks all of those boxes there's a heap of active safety stuff on board again unusual for a 500 with active cruise control traffic sign recognition front rear and side parking sensors blind spot monitoring a b with pedestrian and cyclist detection and more now that said it did only score four stars in end cap safety testing owing mostly to the lack of a central airbag the flying Fades ointment is its ownership proposition with a three-year 150 000 kilometer warranty way below par in Australia these days even if the battery is covered for the standard eight years servicing is every 12 months or 15 000 kilometers and will cost you 250 a pop for the first eight years which is admittedly pretty cheap look it's fairly limited driving range and it's price I mean it's probably not going to be an electric vehicle for everyone but there is no doubting that electrification has worked wonders for the Fiat 500 both in the way that it drives and the way that it feels in the cabin so if you're looking for very City friendly EV with a difference this might be one to check out [Music] oh [Music] [Music]
R-NFILq5hhA,The 2024 Fiat 500e is a Small but Mighty City EV,Driven Car Reviews With Tom Voelk,"want an electric car with personality and one that doesn't break the bank well I give you exhibit a or maybe exhibit ey for [Music] Italian contrary to misinformation electric cars are becoming more popular America's gas stations may look like this many years from now not anytime soon though EVS don't meet a sterile dystopian future at least if Fiat has any say the second generation 500e is bigger and better with personality that would overflow the Coliseum chances are the ghost of Sergio Maron would actually encourage people to buy this one its range is EPA rated at 149 Mi low for some perfectly fine for others because the chin quento is a city car this is its natural habit at behind its happy face there's seating for four more on that later normally the automakers give us loaded cars to test this is a base model and with shipping goes for just over $34,000 if you're buying it does not qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit but it does if you're leasing ironically this inspired model get it comes in a choice of paint colors white black and of course red while the more expensive inspired by beauty is only in rose gold inspired by music just black the single option on any of them is summer performance tires Fiat says they only come one way and implies all versions will be special editions of sorts smitten with a color or trim don't wait to pull the trigger it may not stick around Long Bono uh yeah that Bano will be happy if you buy this one money generated by Red goes to the global fund which helps to end deadly pandemics 500e has been slipping into tight parking spaces in Europe for 2 years now so any kinks should be ironed out its closest competitors are the Mini Cooper SE and Volvo's upcoming ex30 time for another addition of Fran or no Fran any bets no frunk and looks like there's a little bit of room there's no doubt 500e is built in the land of pizza and terisu what a sweet bunch of Easter eggs the Bay has hints of hot dog and apple pie there's no engine oil to check a prop Rod could have saved some money no here's what moves the 500e the 17-in front wheels are turned by a permanent magnetic motor making 117 horsepower and 162 lb ft of torque to move 3,000 lb of car all-wheel drive is not a thing batteries are included the us only gets the larger 42 KW hour pack its Max charge rate is 85 KW the ignition startup tone is as cute as the [Music] car shutdown serious Jeopardy bu bum and it's close 500e is straightforward for a fun car it has a small cluster that's all business the transmission is single speed love the big buttons there are three Drive modes range adds regeneration drag Sherpa is for squeezing out maximum range partly by capping speed at 50 mph 500e doesn't have the performance of a Porsche tyon Turbo it'll Dart to 60 mph in a about 8 and 1/2 seconds but it is an electric vehicle with lots of low-end torque so it feels kind of Punchy off the line neighbors will know exactly when you hit 20 M an hour because at that point the 500e belts out a little tune not sure if you can hear [Applause] [Music] this they might think the ice cream truck is coming it doesn't deliver espresso shot jolts if acceleration like that is important but it feels perky at City speeds always ready for a good time and would keep teens out of trouble top speed is 94 mph driving Dynamics uh the 500e is Miata grade fun remember heavy batteries in the floor a low center of gravity it's fun to Chuck into Corners the suspension is firm but never uncomfortable that means body motions are well controlled and the steering weight is about perfect even a little bit of Road feel the short wheelbase means choppy pavement can cause some bucking at certain speeds and while the 500 is considered a city car highway driving at 75 mph shouldn't stress anyone out it's even moderately quiet range and charge speed might keep this from long-distance travel comfort from behind the wheel this never feels like a tiny clown car uh the vibe is actually surprisingly spacious and the seating position is high enough so that you won't feel intimidated in heavy traffic on tight Urban streets it's more relaxing to drive a compact car no worrying about shearing the side view mirrors off it scores parking spots that Honda Civics have to pass up it's the ultimate grocery getter meant as a compliment and you won't see this Eevee coming and going it has personality did I mention it's Nimble do you turns all the time watch this absolutely brilliant that's a pretty standard two-lane road around 32 ft wide no sweat the average range is rated at 149 mies and in mixed driving with temperatures in the mid-50 low 60s I'm pretty much nailing that now on the highway you're probably going to lose 30 m when you're traveling over 70 M an hour but you know this is a city car that's its Mission and it does it really well all the information for making good decisions is front and center nothing complicated playing with the modes gives drivers an idea how much range can be added or subtracted they it can't be customized though in normal mode this drives and brakes like a regular car throw it into range mode that adds a lot more recuperation drags so there is a one pedal driving Dynamic if you want it my foot was never on the brake it came to a complete stop also the dynamic of the brake pedal going from recuperation to the hydraulic brakes is pretty much seamless throw it into Sherpa mode for maximum range and it shuts down the HVAC system plus reduces power significantly making this car pretty slow the good thing is if you need speed right away there's a click at the bottom of the throttle travel push through that and you get maximum speed again EVS aren't for everyone just yet the best experience requires charging where you sleep this can be DC fast charged but a top speed of 855 KW means it would take 35 minutes to hit 80% charge on a spent pack Fiat throws in a free home charger or $600 worth of charge credit on the freeto Move network using 240 volt level two charging the 500e will juice up from 5 to 100% in about 6 hours hours using 120 it's closer to 37 but here's the thing those who only travel 30 to 40 miles a day that will work for them because one it eliminates the expense of installing level two charging and second of all you can always go to a DC fast charger if you need a quick battery top off for what it's worth this car seems to charge faster than Fiat claims going from 10 to 100 100% in just over 4 hours pulling 40 amps things are clean and simple inside kudos to Fiat Engineers for carving out space in a small car little details too the more expensive inspired by models get a textured panel here plus heated seats with synthetic leather adjustment is manual red editions will leave your bottom cold cushions are firm in a good way the cloth is breathable and advertising is the brand this six- speaker audio system is average hope the upgraded JBL system in other 500s is punchier looking for the door release if the power goes out here's a backup sadly no sunroof is available at least for now I've driven significantly larger cars with fewer storage spaces help by a flat floor a good amount of stuff stashes away in here also umbrella Pockets ironic we don't use those in Seattle it's a pride thing the only cup holder is here quite a reach for your cappuccino being a stellantis product there's the latest UK connect user interface the 10 and a/4 in screen is also found in Alpha Romeo's tanal this is a solid system overall with good response all 500e get autoclimate notice there are physical buttons thanks Fiat Android auto and apple carplay Are Wireless use apps to find charging stations in a pinch a phone charge pad is standard across the board it shouldn't be any surprise that room is kind of tight back here it's a small car I'm 5'9 and I have like a fingers worth of Headroom the cushions are low and short so thigh support isn't all that great but I am surprised that there's adequate knee leg and foot room for my 32in inseam um there's a cup holder but that's about it for features no USB ports to charge phones no seatback pocket no adjustable vents certainly no climate zone um the real test is will your friends get an Uber or will they ride back here I would ride back here but I'm cheap Frugal I'm Frugal Fiat says two is an important number for the 500 generation 2 is two 2 in longer 2 in wider with 2 in of additional seat travel tall people can drive this car the design is simple elegant classic with nothing tacked on people love the look I get it it's adorable these look like The Time Tunnel uh it's a TV show in the 1960s look it up and eyebrows monochromatic it almost looks like the car is dunked in plasti tip some cars twice the price and size have have half the attitude and 500e is bought online with the help of a Fiat genius shades of Apple there uh theoretically that helps with the Good Vibes it's never a good sign when I ditch the flatbed of TP for a regular shopping cart should be expected this is a small vehicle there's some storage under here room for a travel charge cord even with 17-in wheels there's no room for a spare just a repair kit dropping the seats is a cinch um it sure would be useful if the front passenger seat folded flat to carry really long things as it is the rear seats have a large lip and that reduces practicality now eyeballing it I figured three packs of softness and absorbency might fit in back at only 7 and 1/2 cubic feet that's optimistic it's a small boot even with just a couple packs of the two ply the hatch needs needs a healthy push time for red light Greenlight green light 500e is Italian design as classic as the Mona Lisa the driving Dynamics are good for a grin especially snaking through tight Urban streets for a small car the front passenger space is roomier than expected physical buttons and a good interface make this easy to use yellow lights the simplified online buying is appealing but models lack option choices in everyday driving 500 feels spunky it's no a bar though 149 M of range is all that's needed for its City Car Mission people will still want more red lights you'll have to locate a dealer to pick one up which might be at a Chrysler store or Dodge maybe Alpha Romeo best of luck there a small car means a small back seat a small car means a tiny trunk duh I think many owners will just keep the back seat St dropped complaining that the 500e doesn't have 400 m of range is like criticizing Simone biles for not placing in the marathon she's good at what she does so is the Fiat 500e isn't for everybody and it's not supposed to be it's a terrific City car and cute as a plush toy in yellow I think this thing would look exactly like Pikachu to the point where Nintendo would probably Sue over copyright infringement this car is simply too small for some if only because people feel safer with more metal around them for protection but for the few that like to wear their cars like a jetpack the Fiat 500e shows the future of EVS can be a [Music] blast one thing I forgot to mention some automakers say that EVS mess with the AM radio signal and have eliminated the tuner to that Fiat says hold my Kean real quick before I go I have a buying service and if you use it it helps to support this channel so I can do more great car reviews the information is right there I'll also put a link in the video description that makes it easier and you're here at the end so I'm assuming you enjoyed the video sign up to this channel okay do it now before you forget really this should have over a million subscribers

OSvuSISisD8,The new Fiat 500E isn’t that bad…..or is it? 🤔,Forrest's Auto Reviews,"behind me is a new Fiat 500e and it's not bad or is it in the back you get a surprising amount of space and if I need more space I can just throw the seats down and because it's electric it's even more practical because you get a front trunk psych but who cares about a front trunk you get these cloth bucket seats that are neither heated nor ventilated it says Fiat here in the middle I get an adjustable armrest storage space right under there more storage space there a single cup holder I get my gear selector here wireless charging pad a touchcreen with Apple carplay Android auto and built-in Wi-Fi I even get a digital display that makes noises and to make sure you look good in your fat 500 this only makes 117 horsepower which isn't a lot but you get 149 Mi of range which also isn't a lot however it all makes sense when you realize this only costs $199,000 except it does not cost $199,000 it cost $34,000 as tested and this is the base model"
