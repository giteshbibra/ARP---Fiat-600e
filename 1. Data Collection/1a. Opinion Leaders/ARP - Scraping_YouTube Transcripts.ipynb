interesting did you know that in the UK the most popular car color is gray now in 2022 alone in the UK there was 415 000 gray cars sold yeah Sophia have said no was that enough we're not doing it anymore we're doing big bold colors only no more gray no that's not gray shut up that's not gray that's that's the Earth of Italy so definitely not not gray right let's talk about the design of the car essentially this is the bigger sister of the 500e because you know how the 500e is like utterly adorable like the cutest thing you've ever seen this is definitely the bigger sister the reason I say that is because well it's 50 centimeters longer and also has a couple of extra doors but check out her eyes perfect eyeliner flick she's got resting sassy face and resting big sister sassy face you know like one of those so this is the first electric Fiat to be based on other stalantis cars like the Jeep Avenger for example which actually Ginny drove last week so we'll pop a link in the description below so you can watch that video if you like but the big bits that they've taken are things like the 54 kilowatt hour battery which returns 254 miles of wltp range there is something about the team at stalantis that are just really good at making efficient cars because that's 19 more miles than the Hyundai Kona that's 37 more miles than the mg4 SC it's all very very impressive oh and yeah just in case you were wondering we are in Italy at the Fiat Factory yes this is where they film The Italian Job I know right so unlike the Avenger the Fiat might have a sort of suvish look but it's not got any off-road pretensions instead it's meant to be nippy around town and very fun to drive and generally it is look this is very much designed to be a city car it is just a nice bigger version of the 500e except yeah it's just a little bit bigger isn't it this is this is comfortable in town I mean I haven't fully been able to put my foot down in it yet but look at this look I'm basically just driving with one finger this is how you know it's a city car because the steering is so light like really really light weirdly light your most kind of don't feel connected to the car in a way the driving is almost too easy if that makes sense so at the moment we're driving on these windy lovely country roads in Italy which I do have to say are very much like our British roads quite bumpy and quite pothole so we could do a proper test to kind of see how the 600e handles it and it has been crashing into potholes quite a bit now I have heard according to Ginny that the Jeep Avenger copes with the potholes pretty well but this has been this has been a little bit crashy at times even like you know when you kind of go over a drain and you feel like that Rumble and the clunk when you go over a drain yeah you're feeling that through the cabin quite a bit quiet though that's really quiet actually there is a brand new motor inside this which is apparently 50 quieter than its predecessor so that's probably why it's quiet we do have different Drive modes right so we have sport mode which makes it a little bit faster I guess the throttle is a little bit more responsive if you will it's got 154 horsepower we'll do naught to 62 in like nine seconds perfectly adequate you don't need it to be any faster than that we then have normal mode which is when you just drive normally really just like normal stuff and then you have eco mode which kind of slows everything down a little bit and it will reduce the performance a little bit it doesn't have the sherpa mode you know the sherpa mode in the 500e I don't know if you've heard about this but when you put it in Sherpa mode that is when you're at the point where you're starting to panic about the mileage that you've got in your car so you put it in Sherpa mode and it just switches everything off like all the aircon and stuff and gives you a speed limit of like 50 mile an hour or something silly to make sure that you can make it to your destination to charge a car this doesn't have that this just has eco mode I guess because the battery is a little bit bigger and it will get you further than a 500e so you shouldn't have to have that worry oh by the way wonderfully efficient so we check the numbers once we did our lovely drive around Italy and we were getting 4.7 miles per kilowatt hour that's not not too shabby oh we do need to test out the regen braking so there isn't like Flappy paddles or anything like that to kind of change the levels of things instead we have the standard B button B for regen which always makes sense or B for breaking that makes sense doesn't it yeah of course so let's see how well it does when we oh okay well you could feel that couldn't you well there's no one behind me shall we see if it comes to a complete stop or a creep it might go down to a creep down to a creep okay I mean that's fine the thing is is I I do think most of us are electrifying like myself and Ginny included are big fans of regen break-in especially when you can change the levels of region like I like full-blown hearty regen breaking that I can lift my foot off the pedal and I can feel the brakes working and I'll come down to a complete stop you won't get that in this okay here is where you're really going to notice that this is definitely a city car because we're currently on the equivalent of a Motorway if you will and it is noisy road noise wind noise all of the noise that's that's not the most relaxing experience while you're driving at speed better in town welcome to the interior of the Jeep Avenger the Fiat 600e sorry sorry I mean it's an easy mistake to make because it's basically exactly the same like completely the same layout I mean if you see them side by side yeah it looks exactly the same we've got the La Prima version by the way which is the top spec version so we have all the little Ivory bits and I do have to say these seats are very comfortable I do have to give a shout out to the seats I feel like I'm sat in them rather than on them if that makes sense now The Styling in here is quite nice it's very nice and simple like the Jeep Avenger we've got a 10 and a quarter inch screen for all of your entertainment stuff on there and in a tiny little screen behind the steering wheel for all your driving information there are some sort of cheap materials dotted about where it gets a bit scratchy plasticky no gloss black though which is a really good thing I've spotted two things where I think see it have maybe just forgotten about number one is the engine start stop button engine whereas it doesn't have a an engine and this it looks nice but this Flappy is actually just a bit irritating like I'd rather just not have it I mean when it's sort of tucked back here if you kind of keep it out the way because you've got something bigger there you now can't touch any of these buttons it's like one of those sort of cheap iPad covers that you buy I'd rather just not have that at all but but storage is fantastic so they've managed to access an extra 15 liters of space of storage in here because like there is so much space inside here there's wireless phone charging there's so much space in stone here does that lift up it does look at that door bins very decent size what's going on over here that's all that's a very nice size as well storage is cracking yeah just a few little bits that need tweaking huh this is smaller than I expected um that is set up for my driving position let me tell you this for free right when I'm sat in the back of the byd dolphin I can fully stretch my arms out when it's sat when it's set up for my driving position this is just a that's that's quite tight isn't it long-legged folk might struggle back here is there any like cup cup holders and no bit of charge in there for one person simple small and simple it's all right you know I'm pleasantly surprised by it you've got 360 liters of space which is like 20 less than the Jeep Avenger but look they had to find the space somewhere so clearly they just took the space from the rear seats so they could put more space in the boot which is kind of what I mean I mean two big bags in there it's all right it's all right right charging it will take up to 11 kilowatts from a wall box or 100 kilowatts from a DC fast charger so that means it could be less than half an hour to charge the battery to 80 percent hello okay let's get on to the important bit which we all know is the price so the red which is the entry level model is 32 995 pounds and the posha La Prima which is the one that we've got here is 36 995 pounds that makes it cheaper than the Avenger and the Kona and the Vauxhall Corsa with the same battery and motor as this as well but it's obviously more than the Chinese Rivals of mg and byd so what do we think well I mean they're reasonably priced I mean let's be honest fear is a really really popular brand in the UK a lot of people love the 500e so I think a lot of people will love the 600e I think it will be a big seller because of look at how adorable it looks the question is is in terms of price in terms of space in terms of range other Chinese Brands just gonna pivot to the post are they going to sell as well I don't know let us know your thoughts by the way in the comments section below and don't forget to subscribe to the electrifying YouTube channel thank you very much\",\n          \"foreign 500e and you should it's brilliant but for you it was just on the small side then this might be just the thing you need because this is the new Fiat 600e which is basically the 500e but it's bigger chunkier and yeah looks like an SUV that's the simple way of looking at the Fiat 600e and it'll be enough to get most people interested SUVs are super trendy these days of course but there's a lot more going on Under the Skin firstly it's not actually a chunky 500e  technically it's basically a Jeep Avenger and built in the same Factory in Poland and it uses Parts also found in the Vauxhall Market e and the Peugeot e 2008 among a few more so it's a bit French a bit American a bit polish and with some Italians sprinkled on top but what does that matter when it looks like this all the things that make the 500e look cool and cute are here but it does look a bit meaner than the 500e large model name in the center true Fiat style rather than the manufacturer badge but I don't know I'm still not sure about these eyelids Jerry's out for me on those now feet have done a very good job of basically making it look like a chubby 500e nice big wheels up to 18 inch to keep it all in proportion what's interesting are the color options Sophia have apparently banned Gray even though it's the UK's most popular car color bulb move Fiat instead you get uniquely Italian takes on four particular themes C sun sky and Earth but the Earth color is called sand and I don't know what you think but to me doesn't it look quite gray maybe not so bold after all fit and then around the back a very familiar slope very 500-esque and what's interesting is the boot size 360 liters that's double the size of the Fiat 500 and apparently the biggest in class so says Fiat and it does have some useful features but the suspension covers at the side are quite intrusive and you'll actually find a lot more space in a Kia Nero EV or a Peugeot e 2008 fiance this has 15 liters of front storage which apparently is best in class but maybe someone forgot to tell them that the Jeep Avenger which is basically made on the same production line by basically the same company has 34. anyway a cool Central Storage cubby which has this nice looking iPad cover but I might get a little irritating three cup holders um decent sized door bins and a rather large glove box it also has wireless charging and one two three USB ports which is all well and good apart from the kids in the back might have to fight over who uses that one USB at least they won't fight about who uses the rear door Pockets though because there aren't any but a baffling oversight there are buckets on the back of the chairs for phones or books but it'd be nice to have a central armrest with cup holders in for me leg room is sufficient but if they're at all a driver then perhaps that would start to feel a little squished Headroom definitely sufficient isofix on both sides considering it's the same height as the 500e feels good pretty spacious beyond all that it's just really stylish in here the dashboard is lifted from the 500 quite literally and it looks lovely including the integrated LED lighting the touchscreen is fairly straightforward to use and there are shortcut buttons for the main functions so you're not fiddling around in menus too much which is a good job because the software design is quite busy the main question though does it drive as well as Fiat says it does right where's the exit we can't keep going around here all night we're told it has a beautiful joyful pampered Driving Experience Big Talk pampered I'd say overall yes the first thing he notices how quiet it is I mean obviously electric cars tend to be a lot quieter because you don't have the internal combustion sounds but then usually you end up hearing an awful lot of tire and wind noise but actually fiat's done a really good job of shutting that sound out suspension is on the softer side too soaks up the bumps well and body control feels pretty good when you turn sharply in a corner it doesn't feel like the Leaning Tower of Pisa so you might worry that it doesn't have the same frisky character as the Fiat 500 the sense that it's small Nimble and fun especially given that it's an SUV and it uses so many bits of other cars but you shouldn't worry you can feel the 500 in here the steering is really light but it turns the car quite sharply and that means at higher speeds it feels kind of alert and alive but around town also dead easy to maneuver kind of effortless unlike the Fiat 500 which can feel a bit cramped this feels a lot less claustrophobic visibility is good too it's a nice driving position and you've got really good view of the road ahead plus you can pretty much see all four corners of the car the 600e has a single electric motor driving the front wheels but the power you get depends on which of the three driving modes the car's in in normal mode it has 109 horsepower but an Eco that drops to just 82 to make the battery last longer and in sport it leaps up to 154 driving modes in cars like this often don't make much difference but in here they really do whichever mode you're in this is not the fastest of cars not 62 in nine seconds but if you're a speed demon or you like to regularly overtake then pop it in sport mode because it does make a massive difference certainly feels an awful lot snappier the 600e comes with a 54 kilowatt hour battery which is good for about 249 miles or 372 if you're just pootling around town some of its Rivals like the Kia Nero or the Volvo ex30 do have bigger batteries but it does charge pretty quickly at up to 100 kilowatts so that's good for not 80 in about half an hour the 33 000 pounds base model called red doesn't have navigation it also comes with steel wheels under plastic covers ugh you'll need a top level Prima model for your big Alloys and your Sat Nav which is 37 000 pounds it also comes with keyless entry a massaging driver's seat fully adaptive cruise control including automatic stop and go in traffic and even a hands-free tailgate loads of stuff basically but still no rear door pockets or gray paint never gray paint unless you go for sand which is definitely not gray anyway at least they're trying to encourage people to make bold color choices and that sums up the 600e pretty nicely there's just something about it that's more fun more joyful if you like than the average small crossover and if that doesn't convince you the price just might remember at 33 000 pounds is nearly four grand cheaper than a Kia e Nero and Peugeot e 2008 and almost 6 000 pounds less than a Vauxhall Moka e and that combination of price personality and practicality is what makes the 600e here so appealing it's an affordable electric crossover that you'll buy because you want to not just because you need the space I like it it's a shame it's not a bit quicker although sport mode is quite fun the space in the back is not huge and boot space while it's okay it could be a problem if you had a large family but that's just the thing isn't it with these crossover types but all in all yeah if you're looking for a grown-up car but you're not quite ready to be a grown-up then this could be just the car for you [Music] [Applause]
