Faux leather can also be much softer and easier to clean than real leather.

I own a car with real leather and I hate the leather seats, too firm for driving for hours a day for my job. Faux Leather can be made just as firm or softer than real leather because its a mix of vinyl and other recycled rubber materials. It's not just a sustainability thing, it's also a comfort thing.

Plastic based ""leather"" obviously is 500+ years. 

Funnily enough the co2 footprint is about the same. If cattle is being raised as food and the leather is a by product it can be viewed somewhat differently I guess.

But cattle are horrendous for the planet they use exponentially more water than humans or crops per acre plus all the co2 and methane they produce.

Neither are particularly great but had to say real leather if you look after it can last a very very long time. Most don't realise it needs moisturising and feeding etc to keep to going if you do that it can last so long you won't care.

Must say having had both you can't beat real leather it just feels nicer as a meat eater I don't think I'm in a position to lecture one way or the other tbh

This is because you are only interested in DC rapid chargers en route and of course they have their own cables. We live in South West France and have done many long haul trips within France, to UK, Switzerland and Germany... and the only reason to access the type 2 cable is when staying in hotels that offer free overnight charging, by which time you have unloaded your cases and freed up the underfloor storage for the cables..Just thought I would throw in some real world experience there. 🙂",2023-12-23T08:59:51Z

I live in the centre of the North Island of New Zealand, and am unlikely to drive for more than five hours in a day.  (You run into the ocean after that!)  This greatly reduces the need to use public chargers.
Our most recent ""Real world experience"" from a very different part of the world, went like this:
Hastings / Wellington.  Stayed with our Son. Charged overnight from his 10amp power point using our cable.
Caught Cook Strait ferry and drove Picton / Christchurch.  Stayed one week with Mother-in-Law.  Charged from her 10amp power point using our cable.
Drove Christchurch / Picton.  Stayed at Jasmine Court Motel, and charged with their complimentary 7kW charger, using our cable.  Great service... try to find accommodation that will give you a complimentary gas-tank top up!  Some New Zealand retail shops are also offering free 7kW charging with your own cables.
Caught Cook Strait ferry and drove Wellington / Hastings.  (Stopped for a meal, and decided to add a bit of charge from a ChargeNet charger, the only time we did not use our own cables.)
While we were travelling, the back of the car was full to the brim!  Luggage, computer, printer, bedding, box of plant cuttings, and an e-bike.
Every time I charged with one of our own cables I said a quiet Thank-you to the ""Frunk""!  I can't think of anything else I would use it for - the charge port is right there!.
Final bit of info for those pondering an EV:  Before this trip, we have done 5500km (3400 miles) in 5 months.  Our power plan supplies free electricity to our home daily from 9pm to midnight, so we have spent a total of NZD12.74 (USD8.00) on ""fuel"".   What's not to like!",2024-06-12T21:18:21Z

Once you get over the quick acceleration, it's not a very well rounded car. Handling is not great and, apart from the fun of a rapid 0-60mph sprint (the thrill of which wears off after a few runs), it's not a fun car to drive. Also, the interior isn't great, the screen is laggy, the range isn't up to much in the cold, it has loads of overly intrusive driver 'aids' which you cannot permanently disable, it's definitely not something I'd want long-term. 

There are a few EVs that can match petrol for fun (e.g., my friend's Taycan is a match for my 911 Turbo), but most EVs have rapid acceleration but none of the poise we've come to expect from well engineered ICE cars. This will change in time, but for now, most EVs are good for the family runabout but not proper performance motoring as we've come to love.

2023-11-15T17:53:13Z,@jwester7009,VhHwZub5-bY,@@janhenkins First of all it's yet another crossover which is the equivalent of a normal sized person who got really fat and started wearing high heals at the same time. The square like front- and back wing looks like something a diy person did themselves and stock on to the chassis in their home garage. The pentagonal back lights are stock on to the back wings and does not fit the design of the light strip. I could go on and on. This is a design a 10 year old or a Chinese person would really like. To point out it's an EV matters to some. Especially since they are being forced on to consumers as being more environment friendly. By pointing the finger at the consumer it gives the politicians a free pass from doing something about the things that really matter to the environment,2024-06-04T03:38:00Z
2023-11-15T22:39:12Z,@janhenkins,VhHwZub5-bY,"@@jwester7009 Fair enough on the looks of the car, I can see why it doesn't appeal. I like your anology about a portly person in high heels! :-) With regards it being an EV, I still don't see why that should be a negative. I don't agree that they are being forced onto consumers, and they are truly more environmentaly friendly. I decided, without being forced by anybody, to buy a second-hand Nissan Leaf as an experiment. It has obvious flaws (ugly, small battery, etc.), but as a car it is the best vehicle I have ever owned. It drives better, costs less (I pay less than £10 per month charging it, where my previous car cost me approx $115 per month on diesel), and does not blow CO(1), NOx and particulants into the atmosphere. My energy provider (Octopus Energy) gets 100% of their energy from renewable sources, so it is good to know that my car is as ""green"" as I can make it. But apart from it being green, having this EV is a far more practical thing. It performs extremely well (even with modest power, I can out-accellerate most gas-powered cars up to 30mph), and costs almost nothing to run and maintain. Why would I go back to a gas car? It simply does not make any financial sense.

I also don't see why politics should be mentioned in a YouTube video's comment section, but since it was brought up... We are at the start of a climate emergency largely caused by us. This is not a fib, lie, fabrication or old wives tale. The impersonal science shows it clearly to all who wish to see. Electric cars are only a small part of the solution (although it is a very good start), we have an enourmous amount of work to do in order to try and fight this monster we have created. The only politics at play here would be the petroleum companies and their lobbyists buying off politicians to keep us ""in our place"" - a captive audience burning the stuff they sell us, at a price that they control. Take note of any politician or ""journalist"" telling you that EV's are bad and are being forced on people, find out who they are and look into their background. More often than not, with a little bit of Googling you might just find that they have ties to those monstrously rich petroleum companies that makes megatons of cash while people like us have problems affording the basics in life.

So back to the car - yes it's supremely ugly  although I think my old Leaf could just be uglier than that, and yet I find myself not caring at all. And it's an EV, one tick in its favour. But dang, I'm now going to see that car on stilletos in my mind's eye, and I just cannot un-see it. Not Hyundai's finest work, to be sure.",2024-06-04T03:38:00Z

However, the Niro is bigger and has a longer warranty. It kind of depends on her priorities, such as whether size, price (how she'll fund it/what deals are available for each), availability and possibly other stuff is important. Lots of things to consider in this sort of major purchasing decision, which is difficult to answer in a short reply.

I lean a little more toward liking the Kia Seltos, the cousin to this Kona. The styling is less objectionable, and it's priced a few hundred dollars lower when comparably equipped. Given the wild styling of this vehicle, I think it was a missed opportunity that Hyundai didn't put some wild patterned and colored cloth upholstery in the lower trims. The outside is wild and the interior is so monochromatic. A strange juxtaposition. The twist shifter is super cool. It seems logical to use and frees up console space. I wish it was a standard feature. And yeah, the Kona has gotten awfully expensive now. The Kona is definitely not the value leader for the segment. That honor goes to the Chevy Trax with a price range of about $21k-$27k. Hyundai has historically always been the value leader, even undercutting domestic brands, but they seem to be aiming upmarket nowadays.",2024-03-10T14:52:20Z
