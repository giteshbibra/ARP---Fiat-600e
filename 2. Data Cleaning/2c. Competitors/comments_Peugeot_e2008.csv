2024-02-27T16:20:19Z,@Jaya365,-f_LV-6PuFA,"Do not buy this car. I own one and intend to do a review after having one for 24 months here are my thoughts.  I own the GT one so take this. 

Pros

- Looks,  they look great inside and out, it's the best-looking Peugeot they've ever designed. 
- Extras as standard, again I'm speaking about the GT model, but you get almost all the extras as standard including, heated seats, auto fold-in wing mirrors, sunroof, cruise control, laneassisted cruise control ( drives itself on motorway), collision avoidance and detection.  LED lights with auto high beam, proximity key unlock, and smartphone charger. USB ports, reversing and parking assist camera, 
- Boot space, decent boot space for the size of car
-Drive, it's a really nice car to drive thanks to comfort. 
-Charging - CCS charging which is great when on longer trips 

Cons ( and there are plenty) 

- Range. The range is pathetic really, mine is the 2021 model and on full charge you are looking at 200 miles range on the clock - in reality you get no where near that, probably 150 miles at a push. In winter (UK you might be as low as 100 Miles on full charge). For context my commute is 34 miles there and back 3 days a week mostly motorway at under 70 mph and I do about  50 miles social driving, so roughly 150 - 200 miles a week on I have to charge at least twice a week I don't speed and am pretty conservative - winter with frost you are looking at every other day. You will not get 150 miles on a round trip if it's a mixture of motorway and urban.  Also driving eco does practically nothing in terms of range improvements 

- Price, you could get a Tesla for the same price, doesn't look as nice but for performance and everything else Tesla wins. it's probably overpriced for what it is. 

- Software. - The Peugeot app is the single worst app I have ever used. I could write a full comment on that. It doesn't connect, it logs you out fully, you have to enter the pin and then log back in. Sometimes you have to uninstall the app because it just won't work. If you want to precondition the battery on a cold morning you better set aside 5 minutes of waiting, it's unbelievably slow to connect to your car and then performing any operation is even slower. 

And get this - you should precondition your battery when it's cold, it improves the range. But you cannot precondition the battery if it's less than 50%!! I think this is the only car that does this. Nor can you plug in your car and set it to precondtion overnight, it just doesn't work. 

Service intervals are set in K/M although the odometer is in miles so the first time I took mine in for service was told it wasn't needed.  I have seemingly random service intervals now. 

You can't charge to a certain %like other EV's as other suppliers do not recommend 100% charge. 

You have to plug in a USB to update car software even though it can connect to wifi and services. 

Sometimes you get prompts in French, particularly errors, which is useful. 

Trip information updates randomly, often not at all. 

It doesn't update the service history, even though the log is now digital.

Your phone will pull up high battery use for the app as it's not optimised. 

You can only register one phone per car, even if you have more than one driver. 

There have been no major updates the whole time I owned the car despite the fact everyone that uses it, hates it. 

Interior - The touch screen is pretty unresponsive and although you get a larger screen, there's a pointless always-there aircon widget on either side of the screen so you lose about 20% of the screen which is small as it is.  The wireless phone charger is not angled properly, as such you may think your phone is charging but if it's not on the sweet spot, it won't be. 

Build quality. Just coming up to the 3rd service interval and have been had several faults appear in the past week resulting in around ¬£1k of charges luckily mine is a lease and under warranty. Repairs needed include new ball joints, new brake pads despite using the engine breaking 80% of the time, an electrical error (not sure what it was just told by dash to take to dealer), heated seats stopped working. 

the green accent paintwork on the badge for the EV cars which they have since discontinued on  has flaked off. 

So in summary, looks great drives great, range is poor, it's overpriced and has seemingly been overlooked for the EV-only parts. 

Get something else for the price and forego looks.",2024-02-27T16:20:19Z

And we‚Äôre talking top 10 best selling EVs. I think the E2008 was the best selling electric BSuv for a period in Europe. It makes sense we are still early on in EV adoption as a percentage of total passenger vehicle sales. It makes sense that a car past the point of facelift stage is not on dedicated ev architecture. The next gen will be and before any bsuvs from a number of its competitors. The EPuma is yet to launch, which won‚Äôt be dedicated arochirecture and the E2008 is more than halfway through its lifecycle",2024-06-12T22:03:15Z

So the goal for automakers should be to close the gap with Tesla (and soon chinese EVs), and it will be difficult when you have to make compromise because your plateforme must be compatible with an internal combustion engine. For example it will be difficult to have a bigger battery in the e2008 or to switch to LFP. However I am not saying that this e2008 is doomed, just that is will mostly appeal to fans of the brand, or people not well informed of what other brands have to sell, eg because they are used to go to a Peugeot dealer. And of course, for a few buyers with specific needs, this e2008 will be the best car.",2024-06-12T22:03:15Z

All my explanation was/is is that the E2008 and been pretty well positioned for the last 4yrs and will remain competitive as this review explain for at least another two yrs. Then time for the new dedicated platform. That‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs been a good strategy. Tesla also had the desirability of being totally electric (not being a legacy) for the early adopters who are into tech etc. The legacy are better aligned for the remainder than will adopt more slowly. Secondly I still personally think there‚Äôs space for a direct Tesla competitor, if we‚Äôre going to make more ethics and considered purchases Tesla has draw backs.

I've only been an EV driver for about 8 months (in a 4 years old Leaf) but I would have no hesitation in recommending an EV to anyone looking for a change of car - they are SO quiet and relaxing to drive, yet have such instant acceleration in / around town where it can be really helpful. Plus, even compared to the 55mpg Prius hybrid I had before, my 'fuel' cost is about a 1/4 of what I was spending on petrol - and I'm not even on the cheapest electricity tariff, either...
EVs are absolutely the way forward. 
My only caveat would be get something with around a 200 mile WLTP range, as the driver will need a 'comfort break' before the battery is empty - my 100 mile Leaf is just a little compromised on a longer motorway trip... not unusable, by any means, but longer trips just need a bit more where-to-charge-on-route planning...!",2020-10-06T16:30:47Z

Very true, but even if you do have the money, not everybody WANTS to spend ¬£60000 on a car.
If that's the thing that makes you happy, go for it, but to many people a car is a practical object to get you from A to B. So if you can do that safely in comfort and quick enough in a nice looking car that costs half of that amount, there's really no need to spend more.",2023-05-01T18:52:35Z

1) must be nice to have money for this sort of thing.
2) regen braking once you lift off: fine. But do remember your brake lights are poking the driver behind you into defensive action every time you consciously or unconsciously do that. Which, I can say from experience, is *exhausting*.
Regarding that: I feel as though there should be three types of brake light on every new car: slowing down/regen (just left & right brake lights), braking (including the top bar), crash stop (left & right, top bar rapidly blinking).
3) this guy could sell me anything. Which is kinda scary now I think about it.",2021-11-23T19:41:22Z

2020-12-23T06:56:40Z,@DTS7709,ccpD3Xod_iQ,"I have taken delivery of this car this week and have jotted down some things that annoy me:

- EV Charger won‚Äôt pull out if you don‚Äôt do it immediately after unlocking. If you fail you then have to close all doors and the boot, lock the car and unlock it again. A nightmare if you have kids or passengers. 
- Bottom of doors INSIDE the car get dirty - water makes its way in somehow
- Kwph graph on the infotainment totally pointless as it‚Äôs Y axis scale goes to 120kwh per mile. Stupid as you‚Äôll only ever get between 2-5 so the graph is miniature and therefore pointless. 
- MyPeugeot App took ages to connect - like a week, and it‚Äôs an incredibly clunky process. 
- Apple CarPlay cancels any radio station you‚Äôre listening to and just sits there in silence until you go all the way through settings and find radio again
- No setting for defaul blower speed so it always comes on MAX which is both loud and unpleasant. Trying to change it is a real faff with all the touchscreen UI. 
- Water runs in boot if you open it whilst the car is wet
- Can‚Äôt set pre condition temperature - so even after I got the app working, you can‚Äôt select a temperature you‚Äôd like to set, the car decides for you. Usually around 22 degrees. So much for setting it to be like a fridge when you‚Äôre 10 mins away from your car and it‚Äôs 38 degrees outside.",2020-12-23T06:56:40Z

2020-10-08T06:59:28Z,@rogeriogomesosorio4755,ccpD3Xod_iQ,"Matthew Railton hello. Actually I do it quite often. The 200 miles range wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if: a) charging network would be available everywhere. The two typical situations where you would charge your car throughout the day are when the car sits at work and at home. Most workplaces don‚Äôt have parking for their employees and much less charging stations. Most people don‚Äôt have garage at home where they could charge. So they would have to rely on public charging network which is poor and of low quality; b) speed charging. Speed charging is still a problem because it takes to long. So if you need to make a long trip, it will increase in a few hours the time to arrive to your destination. A small business owner that relies on its car to go to place a to b as fast as he can an return, electric car would be a problem. Also, because charging network still is of poor quality and small (Tesla network aside) you can even find yourself having to wait a few hours along the way, not only when you charging, but even to get a spot to charge your car. Finally: charging cost: typically, if you charge at home, it will be cheaper to run an electric car than a ice car. But, if you have to rely on public network that‚Äùs no longer the case specially you you use the ionity network.",2020-10-08T06:59:28Z

And none of the options available are able to completely replace an ice car. The ones that get the closest are Tesla cars. But built quality is pretty poor. 
The truth is only one: EV cars are not ready, yet, to take over as the new form of transportation. Cars manufactures are pushing electric cars to consumers, not because they think that technology is ready, but because they know that they are obliged to reduce carbon emissions. So they push expensive cars, to avoid tax penalties. I really wish that EV's are the solution, but as of right now, they are not.",2020-10-08T09:33:43Z

And, Porsches are made not for range and Screen gimmicks, it‚Äôs just for the appeal of driving a Porsche, which is: Handling, speed, and dynamics. Although, Porsches do have the upper hand in interior quality as well, as said to last longer compared to Tesla‚Äôs where they start to get glossy and cheaper in the future. Nonetheless, there will always be progression, but there is that extra tax with buying a German car. (sorry if my english is bad it‚Äôs not my first language)",2020-10-06T13:13:43Z

I've only been an EV driver for about 8 months (in a 4 years old Leaf) but I would have no hesitation in recommending an EV to anyone looking for a change of car - they are SO quiet and relaxing to drive, yet have such instant acceleration in / around town where it can be really helpful. Plus, even compared to the 55mpg Prius hybrid I had before, my 'fuel' cost is about a 1/4 of what I was spending on petrol - and I'm not even on the cheapest electricity tariff, either...
EVs are absolutely the way forward. 
My only caveat would be get something with around a 200 mile WLTP range, as the driver will need a 'comfort break' before the battery is empty - my 100 mile Leaf is just a little compromised on a longer motorway trip... not unusable, by any means, but longer trips just need a bit more where-to-charge-on-route planning...!",2020-10-06T16:30:47Z

Now the issue is the dealer handed back the car to a customer with some of the safety features not working, thats not good and finally the car went in for the 30000km service and on the way home the service light came on so i checked the pollen filter and it wasnt changed thats some service from Peugeot. My guess is the car wasnt serviced they just stamped the book.

The Peugeot e2008 certainly looks the part, but how does it compare to the other compact SUV electric cars on the market? It's beautifully made and easy to drive, but for a car with a usable battery of 45kWh you might expect a better real world range than this offers. The inside is comfortable and it has a decent boot but it lacks a reversing camera and has some quirky internal lights that look flashy, but are a bit distracting. The e2008 is a decent effort, but in an increasingly crowded market for compact SUVs, does it do enough? You tell us!

Looking at the model you have it is a GT Line with options, it has not got the alcantara interior but it does have the panoramic roof?

Real life range should be about 180 from personal experience in town but maybe a lot less on motorways. Also Peugeot Marketing has been using the WLTP of 190-200 not the NEDC

The ambient lights colour can be changed and also lowered or turned off completely.

There is a button on the end of the wiper stalk to show you your trips including Mile per KWh 

Love the vids and i would love to answer any questions you might have as someone who is actually dealing with these models on a daily basis.

If sustainability and efficiency is the goal I think there's enough choice on the market now to push people towards the native EVs, over retrofit EVs like this, much like Fully Charged used to encourage people to simply buy BEVs over hybrids and range-extenders.

As a reviewer (no, as any car owner) you should know the number on the display is calculated in several ways and depends massively on the way you drive it and where you drive it (city or motorway), so you shouldn't be pointing out ""only 130 miles"" instead of the projected 267 miles on the NEDC standard (which NOBODY uses, everybody uses the WLTP standard!) before you've actually driven it. Point is, if you are looking to find negatives, you will find them, whether they are relevant and real or not.

And what should that be then? The front window on top of the front bumper, so people would know there can't be a combustion engine there? Nothing wrong with having the car look like a CAR, in my opinion. The only thing not enough manufacturers do is take advantage of the extra available space (in the frunk). But that supposedly is partly because it's harder (expensive) to fit in frunks and pass crash tests. At least, that's an explanation I heard from a Smart executive, who explained why there's only a tiny 15l frunk in the Smart #1. And to come back to my first point, the old tiny Smart cars hardly had an engine compartment, and they never became a success partly because they just looked weird to many people. So now Smart has changed directions and their new car (although an EV) looks like a CAR instead of a box on wheels.",2023-04-30T14:23:24Z

2022-12-11T21:13:37Z,@ianrkav,8J8pcx7GUr4,"I just had one of these as a loaner while my diesel car was in for a service. I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed driving it, so much so that I just drove aimlessly around for a while just to experience it some more:-) I liked the smooth linear power delivery and of course, how quiet it was. Some have mentioned intrusive road noise but I didn't find it intrusive at all. It rode quietly and smoothly, and I drove over some very rough roads. Space inside was ok too. I'm 6"" and I found the space in the back seat behind me was more than adequate. 
I did find visibility a little restrictive though. The rear view mirror, because of the sharply raked windscreen, was half way down the windscreen and blocked a lot of the view to the left. Also, I found judging the near side a bit tricky due to the high bonnet line so squeezing through narrow gaps in traffic was a little tricky at first, but I quickly go used to it. 
I also liked all the high tech in the car such as sat nav, apple and google play, reverse camera, inductive charging for smart phones etc. You couldn't ask for anything more.
As for range I got it fully charged and in eco mode it had a range of 192 miles. This went down to about 170 miles in normal and 150 I think it was in sport mode. I found eco mode a bit sluggish and the accelerator required a fair push to get moving along nicely. Also, heating/air con was restricted in this mode too. Normal and sport were more like an ice car and it was these modes I used most. When I took it back eco mode was showing a range left as 100 miles. I hadn't done 92 miles, only about 50, but I had used normal and sport modes a lot and had the heating on so that must have been where the extra charge was used.
To sum up I was quite impressed with this 'looks bigger than what it is' little car and seriously considered considered getting one, until I discovered the price! The spec I had was a new Allure Premium+GT with just 300 miles on the clock. It retailed at a fraction below ¬£40,000! That's a hefty price to pay for an electric motor and some lithium batteries I thought. I'm still considering though,  mainly to use locally, which is most of my driving anyway, and also because the tech intrigues meüôÇ
This all electric car is not something to use if you're doing lots of motorway miles but they are a great city car and 95% or more of us do drive mostly locally. As we all know they have no exhaust so don't pollute locally or wherever you're driving. They simply move the pollution elsewhere, ie, the power station where the pollution can be dealt with in one place with various filters etc. Which is a big plus I think:-)",2022-12-11T21:13:37Z

But, in reviews, like this is, I miss more balanced views. For example, many of us think EVs are really soulless and dull vehicles, when driving is considered. Driving an EV, for me is like driving a car in a computer game. Much too often very soft and lukewarm on general feedback from road, brakes or steering wheel. Booooring! I also wonder if Mr. Robert is really satisfied with countless waiting hours, needing for battery to refill? Ok, he uses fast chargers and drives these cars on automotive companies' cost, so it is easy to understand his enthusiasm. But, what if he was just a common user who would drive only his Nissan Leaf of first generation? Would he still be so enthusiastic with slow charging and slow driving on highways, managing cables every time he stop somewhere or paying a very high price for such a car? Yes, yes, I can hear you, saying: ""yeah, let them doubters drive conventional vehicles and pay a lot for gasoline, service etc...  But, if this YTB channel (and everyone else look-alike) were sincerelly objective and de facto independent from the car industry, we would have witnessed a completely different or at least a more balanced presentation of these vehicles. 
For example, why don't we see proper comparisons and calculations (with conventional vehicles of the same class and/or price), which, in addition to always present battery range and acceleration to 100 km/h would also include top speeds, waiting times for recharging/refueling (maybe expressed also in financial terms), comparisons in speed averages (how many EVs do we see driving above 120 km/h on highways?), gasoline & electricity costs, and most important, price comparisons. Namely, prices of EVs are so excessive, even if we take into account high price of batteries or savings compared to driving/owning conventional vehicles, that up to EUR 40.000 EVs are not very competitive. And I did not take into account driving pleasures, fast refueling times, or cost of purchase and ownership divided on a longer period of time with conventional options. Fortunately, despite the global PR media offensive, we as users still have a freedom of choice and right now, both Mr. Robert and I, in different parts of the world, are enjoying themselves behind the steering wheel.

2020-12-22T20:16:38Z,@fullychargedshow,8J8pcx7GUr4,"Okay, here's a quick breakdown of how much 450 miles can cost in an electric car.
If the car does around 4 miles to the kilowatt hour (the Peugeot e2008 would manage that for 9 months of the year in the UK) and you charge at night on an off peak tariff, (I pay 5p per kWh overnight) then it's going to cost just over a penny a mile.
450 miles would be in the ¬£5-¬£5.50 range.
If you charge on daytime tariff, say 15p per kWh, that would cost about ¬£16.50 for 450 miles.
If you only used rapid chargers, (24p per kWh) then it would set you back about ¬£28 for 450 miles.
Then, the most expensive electricity you can buy is from IONITY chargers (they are very fast) and they charge 69p per kWh.
This means 450 miles would cost ¬£77. So yes, it is possible to pay more for electricity than it is for fuel.
But one final point, if you get an IONITY card, then you only pay ¬£8 per charging session regardless of how much electricity you consume, so clearly you'd only use an IONITY touch to pay charger and pay 69p per kWh in an emergency.",2020-12-22T20:16:38Z

I think way too much emphasis is put on fast charging and range - essentially comparing to the ice experience on road trips. Some people might drive far often but most don't. Why not focus on how the car does for urban everyday driving and shoot in a note on what to expect on long trips. This car has enough range to handle everyday urban driving for almost everybody and the reasonably fast charging makes the occasional long trip quite ok. After having a tesla model 3 for 3 months, we used superching for one trip. I think its time to stop downplaying mid-range EVs. From a resource-perspective and in a world where electric cars are battery starved, these cars should not be downplayed like this.",2020-12-21T15:54:24Z

2020-11-22T13:45:39Z,@UKenGB,8J8pcx7GUr4,"I'm not sure what Robert is complaining about when he says it looks like an ICE car and not something designed from the ground up as electric. Exactly what is it missing that it should have, or conversely what has it got that it shouldn't - in relation to ICE vs. EV?

This is not the first time this complaint has been made and I don't understand it. What are the designers missing that is apparently so important?

I can only conclude that the use of regular instruments and gauges in the position accepted by all except Tesla as the best location, i.e. in front of the driver, is what causes Robert to complain. He is a Tesla owner and it appears to make him think any car with information display in the traditional location, i.e. in front of the driver is 'dated'. I know he had a Model S, but now a Model 3 which he loves and I think leads him to mistakenly believes that all EVs should now have an iPod stuck on the middle of the dash and nothing else with which to control the car.

In fact the reason why most cars have their info. display in front of the driver is because ergonomically IT'S THE BEST PLACE. I know you can get used to turning your head to see the Tesla iPod, but that is NOT as convenient as simply dropping your eyes. That's why every manufacturer designs their cars that way (except Tesla) as the last 100 years of auto design have concluded that in front of the driver is indeed the best place. Then Tesla come along and have to be different and being more computer oriented than car manufacturer, they mistakenly think one big single touch screen display in the middle of the dash is a cool idea. NO IT'S NOT. It's a stupid place to have everything and touch screens are a nightmare to use while driving, especially on a rough road.

I don't hate Tesla at all and admire them greatly, but their choice of information display and control system as it is on everything bar the Model S, is dumb and the main reason I would not buy one.

It all reminds me of the company that has probably influenced User Interface design more than any other, at least in this millennium - Apple. In the early days of the Mac they wanted to encourage good software and UI design from their fledgeling developer community and published a book titled 'Human Interface Guidelines', to assist developers and ensure a coherent design for all Mac software. In this book I read the immortal phrase that I have never forgotten:-

""Consistency should be valued above idiosyncratic cleverness""

In trying to be different and hence inconsistent with all other UI design of in-car information displays, Tesla have displayed an appalling tendency for what I would actually term ""idiosyncratic stupidity"". Being different is not a good thing when what you have made different is WORSE than what went before.

But to return to the original point, I'd be interested to hear what Robert does think makes the Peugeot too much like an ICE car?",2020-11-22T13:45:39Z
2020-11-22T11:45:13Z,@florimondkrins9980,8J8pcx7GUr4,"It is dangerous to compare energy efficiencies between petrol and electric without taking in consideration the total chain of energy transformation from primary to final product. What's in your electrical car battery is the almost final product as you have the efficiency of the engine to consider as well, whilst for petrol the engine efficiency is pretty poor (25 to 35 % depending on the technology).

For the electricity used you need to consider how it was produced, transported and stored, which is complex as the electricity you store in your batteries could be generated from many different sources ( gas, coal, nuclear, hydro, wind solar...).

For Petrol or diesel, you have to consider the efficiency in its extraction, transport and refining.

I guess what would be more important to consider is the primary source of the electricity generation, the losses in its transport and storage.

Also something that is not mentioned enough is the weight of cars in general, which is not helped by the heavy batteries needed for long ranges. The heavier the car the less energy efficient it will be.",2020-11-22T11:45:13Z

this is what VW does absolutely right.
* they have a pure EV plattform
* they offer three different battery sizes and this gives them a HUGE advantage, because in the sales statistic they see what people really buy and not just claim to would buy.
with thee different battery options VW exactly knows from their sales statistics, if they need to increase battery sizes or not. listening to customers what battery size they really want by looking into the sales figures is the smartest thing that they can do.

In the physics world, running at 65mph require the same power, the nature if the thing does not care what is pushing it.
But Electric can regen kinetic energy, that an ice car cannot.
So 130 MPGe is in reality around 130/3 = 43 mpg at the pump.

They can't charge an electric car and the public infrastructure while improving simply isn't there.  Sadly we are still slightly at the point in the UK where the ability to charge an electric car is a luxury, especially one like this that would have managed maybe 2 days of my commute if I was a bit lucky.  So either you spend an hour in a tesco car park 3 times a week or you buy a petrol, the trim level is not the determining factor here.  Once this improves, and it will do in both range and charging provision then boggo spec electrics will be vital.  Now? I don't think they'd sell.",2020-11-18T10:10:52Z

The car has been designed with EV in mind, clearly. It's built on same line as ICE vehicles and the same underpinnings as e208, Corsa and that nasty üòÇüòÖ green Mokka he looked at and loved a few wks back . You can't expect car makers to jump 100% immediately to electric. The trip reset/view is on the stalk. The led lights can be adjusted or switched off. Car does come with a reverse camera to my knowledge. The range is fine for now, PSA are not TESLA and are in a transition themselves. He was unfortunately wrong about the spec levels...got totally confused with that. I felt he had pitty on the car in the end by saying he will drive it a few days more.... As though he had his nose turned up to it and that it was something like Tesco value goods. Maybe he has something against Peugeots, non wacky EVs or sub 4 secs vehicles.

The other point I would make is to quote mpg is a bit of a red herring, it all depends or how and where you charge. For example.:- home charge peak 14p per kWh. Off peak on OctopusEnergy:-5p per kWh Rapid charge point 35p per kWh. Ionity rapid charge 79p per kWh. It‚Äôs cheaper if one can home charge but a huge number of people can‚Äôt and they will have to use public charge points which are much more expensive.

That familiarity to traditional cars works for a lot of people who don't want a wacky, novel experience from their car. They don't offer base spec trims because a) they don't sell well for any car - most people buy mid or top level trims anyway. b) how do you justify the cost of a base spec EV which is many thousands more expensive than the equivalent combustion car?

No-one uses NEDC range, Peugeot themselves stress WLTP and in my e208 it is clearly accurate, I have driven 200+ miles on one charge more than once (ok it was during the summer). The e2008 is only slightly less economical, by all accounts and in recent tests both variants have exceeded the WLTP figure. Ignore the GoM - the software is too pessimistic and a software update is out there to fix it. I don't see any link to the fossil fuel mentality, though the bonnet on an e208 is smaller it is true. Agree it needs a reversing camera (my GT has one). Surely there is a good argument for introducing an EV option into the range to make it seem less of a leap to drivers not fully signed up to the EV revolution?

But there is no solution to this dilemma. The miles remaining on any particular amount of charge varies greatly, and it depends on how you drive. Heavy throttle or light throttle will make a large difference to the miles remaining.

So far only a small portion of EVs managed this.

Many EV's made in 2020 were there mainly for regulations. Let's face it. Otherwise they would have waited a year with way more range and charge speeds. This includes ID.3, 4 and also the 208 and 2008. Especially horrible EV's like the Honda-E and Mazda MX-30 show that these are just statement cars.

If we use USA data, as it has higher average mileage than any other country, so is basically the worse case scenario. USA drivers do around 13,500 miles per year on average, or 260 miles a week. That's  about 37 miles per day on average in the US (assuming they drove 7 days a week). So even if someone did 5 times US average each day, that would still be under 200 miles a day. And again, this is the worse case country.

Other countries do much less mileage on average, the UK for example does 7,400 miles per year on average, and has been gradually dropping for the last 30 years (it used to be around 12,000 a year). Germany is slightly higher than the UK at 7,800.  So that works out at about 22 miles per day on average for Germany. Most other countries in Europe do less mileage than Germany. Japan is even less, at under 6,000 miles per year, so under 17 miles per day on average, less than half the US average!

So when an EV reviewer says 200 miles is plenty for most people, that's literally what they mean, it's plenty for MOST people in the World, based on actual statistics.

Also bear in mind, many of these cars are being produced by European and Japanese companies, for the European and Japanese markets.

There will always be outliers of course, and even for an average user, there will be days when the car isn't used and then other days when they do a longer than normal trip.",2020-11-17T16:19:37Z

But I think the 5 gallon tank is a little different, with an ICE you always have to go to a station to fill up, which would be a pain if you needed to do that every day!
With EVs, most people (although not all of course *) would charge them at home overnight, and would only use 3rd party chargers if they were traveling beyond the cars range.

In other words,  this is energy from before humans existed and no renewable source can reach back in time to collect energy from the past like that. You could ofcourse argue that this is a highly inefficient process too as biomass is only capable of capturing a fraction of a percent of the sun energy used, but the energy supplied by the human effort to get it is much less.",2020-11-19T06:30:18Z

From Wind Turbine or Solar PV Capture to Spinning wheels is still multiple times higher RATIO for Electric Supply Chain. While BioMass Fossil Fuels has a much small RATIO from Capture to spinning Wheels. You are trying to argue the Sheer Nominal amount of energy is More which make no sense. You can not consume that much energy in an EV. Again your argument is logically broken. RATIO vs Sheer Amount.,2020-11-19T06:43:03Z
2020-11-19T06:49:15Z,@Tore_Lund,8J8pcx7GUr4,"@@Neojhun A solar panel takes on average 4 years to give back the energy spent on its manufacture. If we then presume a 25 years life, it is capable of supplying four times more energy than it has consumed. A barrel of oil takes 4% of its energy to become gasoline adding another 5% for infrastructure and gas stations and geopolitical tensions, it is still massively more efficient than solar.  Energy efficiency of an EV is a pointless argument. The point is that the energy used has less CO2 emissions and the higher efficiency of an EV itself adds to that, but still, overall efficiency of energy into revolutions of tyres, is worse than using oil. Nb.: I've just ordered another 10W polycrystaline panel for my dashboard for 20 quid. For that money, I could have bought 20L of gasoline containing 180kWh, of which a car could deliver 36Kwh in mechanical energy. The 10W panel will produce 10W*6hours*365*25 years= 547kWh in ideal conditions on my lattitude. However it has taken 100 kWh to make it: mining, refining, crystal growing, slicing and doping and finally encapsulation, so per pound paid, it will give around 10 times more energy. However this panel is horisontal and behind a windshield, so more like only 5 times that of gasoline. So in total I will get like 20% more energy per pound paid, if I deduct the 100kWh used on manufacture. However The reason it is worth while, is because, my DC converter has only 60% efficiency at low load, which typically happens with daytime driving, where only the inverter coolant pump and ECU is powered. That draws 260W from my main pack, but adding my first 10W panel reduced the consumption by 24W, so in reality solar is worth more and cheaper than wall outlet power in an EV, i.e. an efficiency gain.",2020-11-19T07:20:39Z

ICE typically fall around 10% to 13% overall efficiency.  There are losses at every step in the processing of the fuel, before the engine is involved.  40% is a maximum engine efficiency, not typical.

Battery EV is around 70% overall efficiency, and rising.  Around 10% losses internal to the vehicle (mostly conversion losses from AC to DC and back), with the rest being generation losses.  This is if using a non fossil-fuel source.  A poor coal-fired power plant will only be about 55% efficient at producing electricity, so your overall efficiency would drop to somewhere around 35% to 40% if using such a source.

Worst-case scenario gives battery EV at least three times the overall efficiency, and this could range up to seven times.",2020-11-19T11:56:47Z

At 60 mph a model 3 uses 17kW to maintain speed (measured from the socket), but requires 14kW in mechanical power, 3kW is lost. However an engined car needs typically  only 12kW to maintain 60 mph, because IT weighs half as much, and Rolling resistance is still 30-40% of losses at that speed, and is burning 4-5 L gasoline per hour, i.e. 47-36kW in heat input.

That is why, compared by how much human effort it takes, is far less energy demanding, than other energy surces. You can argue that electricity is not even a resource, it has to be manufactured, which is much harder than liquid fuel made over millions of years, just for the taking. So overall efficiency for a gasoline powered car, if you include the ""free"" energy content of oil, is 200-400% even when the engine itself is only 25%.  An electric car can on paper never exceed 100% efficiency (with perfect motor, battery and wheelbearings), energy will always be lost on the way to the vehicle..",2021-01-29T19:55:54Z

If it uses 9MWh per month as you say, while it pumps 43 thousand barrels, each barrel then uses 2.09kWh of electricity or around 1% of the energy content of that oil it has just pumped (even if a Tesla can go 5-8 miles on that amount of energy a car can go further from the 120L of gasoline you get out of that barrel)! So it is very efficient. refining takes 5kWh energy (not only electricity but also heat) because the waste heat from distillation is used to pre heat the next batch of oil going into the refraction tower. Distribution and advertising and gas stations is another 5-8% losses. So overall the oil industry produces more energy than it consumes. This is the reason it has been king for a century, because it contains ""free"" energy made by geology and that is something hard to beat at the bottomline. However as oil reserves become more costly to extract, and solar and wind is getting cheaper, this balance is shifting, but oil has had an obvious advantage by being concentrated energy just for the taking. We want to get rid of oil, but not because it is inefficient and we are transtioning to cleaner sources that are less efficient because we need to reduce emissions drastically, but oil has always been the fuel with less effort per kWh at the wheels of vehicles.",2021-04-12T06:20:34Z
2021-04-12T11:09:43Z,@Tore_Lund,8J8pcx7GUr4,"@@bdelphan My counter argument is still right too, 9000kWh is still 43 thousand barrels capable of propelling a gasoline car for 33 million miles or half that if we're talking a big car only getting  32mpg. So the fact that an electric motor is 4 times more efficient than a combustion engine, is in itself remarkable, but it is the whole chain of energy use vs. return, that has made gasoline the obvious choice. If we are going to talk about electricity production, it also  has its own set of connected losses and has not been concentrated to dig up over millions of years. We like electric cars because they are #1: cheaper to drive (I use half of what I spent on gasoline, just paying list price + tax at home) #2: they have fewer emissions, and if you drive a lot, it is not an insignificant reduction of your household emissions , to get an EV. 3# You can make your own fuel legally, if you got solar! #4: maintennance is rudimentary and is mostly the easy diy stuff like brakes and wheelbearings and new viperblades. So from that perspective it is the better vehicle, but it requires more man-produced energy per mile  driven, than a gasoline car, that cheats by borrowing from nature.",2021-04-12T11:09:43Z

The Peugeot e2008 certainly looks the part, but how does it compare to the other compact SUV electric cars on the market? It's beautifully made and easy to drive, but for a car with a usable battery of 45kWh you might expect a better real world range than this offers. The inside is comfortable and it has a decent boot but it lacks a reversing camera and has some quirky internal lights that look flashy, but are a bit distracting. The e2008 is a decent effort, but in an increasingly crowded market for compact SUVs, does it do enough? You tell us!

Looking at the model you have it is a GT Line with options, it has not got the alcantara interior but it does have the panoramic roof?

Real life range should be about 180 from personal experience in town but maybe a lot less on motorways. Also Peugeot Marketing has been using the WLTP of 190-200 not the NEDC

For that price, you have a very competitive and upmarket electric SUV that I'd pick out of most EVs at that price point. BUT at it's orginal sale price of $59,990, I felt it was not providing the value that other EVs offered at that price range.

We get 80 km of pure EV driving per full charge, which is more than our daily driving.  We haven‚Äôt used a drop of petrol since we first bought it‚Ä¶ it literally still has the full tank of petrol (53 litres) sitting in it since we first bought it.

I actually want to switch off the ev mode so I can use up the petrol so we aren‚Äôt carrying around 39 kg of useless weight.",2023-09-06T14:04:16Z

2023-09-06T12:50:41Z,@iEnofadov,cZHgS0GaCwc,"Being a current owner of the previous generation Peugeot 2008 for 10 years, I've always enjoyed sitting behind the steering wheel of Peugeot's early design of its i-Cockpit layout. I've never had an issue with it, but will admit the smaller steering wheel did take some getting used to. It's been a great little practical crossover over the years! I've always admired the second generation 2008 from a far, but felt there were better options out there. It's the same case with the e-2008 unfortunately. I just don't get why Peugeot wants to be a niche brand in Australia and only offer expensive vehicles.

On a side note, our old Peugeot 2008 Active will be getting replaced with the new Skoda Karoq 110TSI Style in a week or two, which will then share garage space with our Volkswagen Polo 85TSI Comfortline.",2023-09-06T12:50:41Z

2023-09-06T13:48:25Z,@351tgv,cZHgS0GaCwc,"Hybrids from Toyota are pretty much bullet proof as its pretty much dumb technology standard, a ""nickel metal hydrate"" battery pretty much is the lowest standard  for Hybrid but its also one of the best in terms of how simple it is, hence why Toyota use it for their petrol/hybrid based engines.

Now as for full BEV only vehicles? look if you have solar with battery backup then its fine as a metro/urban/cbd run about, if you rely on grid power with no solar then your wasting your time, yes its cheaper than a petrol powered vehicle but no where near as covenant and then you have to factor in external recharging which is not cheap at all in relative terms either,",2023-09-06T13:48:24Z
2023-09-06T10:53:36Z,@gregturner_awod,cZHgS0GaCwc,"I used to like Peugeot vehicles and owned 2 many years ago. The problem with an EV based on an ICE vehicle is that it really isn‚Äôt a purpose built EV, and I do think the alternatives you suggest are better options, without a doubt. The MG4 is a purpose built EV, as is the BYD Atto. I agree with your views on the Peugeot dashboard, I like it, and the car looks well finished. If I wanted one I‚Äôd wait for the updated model.",2023-09-06T10:53:36Z

2023-09-06T09:25:20Z,@lukeclifton4392,cZHgS0GaCwc,"Absolutely, especially here in Aus. Consumers and manufacturers have realised the greenest solution are the Hybrid offerings. The purchase price is also an inhibiting factor in Australia, or any country for that matter that doesn‚Äôt offer rebates or tax incentives.

It will take around 10yrs of usage and feedback in the market before the issues really start appearing. The shortfalls are already apparent in environmental impact, battery longevity and replacement cost‚Ä¶ the insurance and crash repair costs, battery safety and lack of battery recycling in Australia are becoming apparent.

I believe Japan‚Äôs lack of interest in EV‚Äôs, China‚Äôs enormous wastelands of sold (but unused) EV‚Äôs and VW groups incredible scale back of EV production are signs of the the failing EV segment. 

EV‚Äôs were deployed by unscrupulous companies to make profit from the ‚Äúto be short lived EV market‚Äù before its impending replacement with Hydrogen.",2023-09-06T09:25:19Z
2023-09-04T09:04:34Z,@peppercorn8451,cZHgS0GaCwc,"Always wondered but with ICE vehicles there‚Äôs a lot of discussion on reliability (eg Toyota is pretty reliable, Jaguar isn‚Äôt). How is reliability measured for EVs? They no longer have all those parts anymore. Aside from stuff like cabin quality, does this mean all electric vehicles are on the same reliability footing?",2023-09-04T09:04:34Z
2023-09-06T01:37:44Z,@rexthesheep,cZHgS0GaCwc,"It's honestly something that's on my mind a lot too. I find myself more confident in the reliability of these European brands when it comes to EVs. How that'll actually pan out in the long term, I guess we can only wait and see.",2023-09-06T01:37:43Z
2023-09-06T06:00:52Z,@jimmyp1433,cZHgS0GaCwc,"@@rexthesheep The only thing that separates an EV from an ICEV is the mechanical aspect of the driveline - That is the 'long block engine' portion, and the ratio-changing portion of the transmission. Everything else is , for arguments sak, the same.  So you remove that aspect, and any reliablity issues associated with it, and replace it with an electric motor+Inverter unit,and a single speed transmission. All things being equal, you'd expect the Electric driveline to certainly be significantly more reliable mechanically (but not infallible) due to its simplicity, but potentially a bit less reliable electrically, due the complex and high power inverter that is absent in an ICE..  the net outcome I would say is a higher level of reliability overall for an EV ,  - but still the same old situation for every other aspect of the car that causes people problems, and frustrations, and this will happen for as long as manufacturers cut corners in engineering, both mechanically, electrically, and 'electromechanically , including material specification,  and for as long as variations in Quality control at the manufacturing level exist .",2024-06-04T03:25:17Z
2023-09-06T09:40:48Z,@lukeclifton4392,cZHgS0GaCwc,"@@rexthesheepVery good question. However the European brands are known for their electronic gremlins and failures, so I don‚Äôt understand why you would feel more comfortable with a euro brand?

Also based on your question‚Ä¶ if an EV could effectively last 1 million Km with just minor mechanical parts replacement such as wheel bearings, suspension, pads etc and having its battery replaced every 200,000km (think that‚Äôs being abit generous, but for argument sakeüòÇ)‚Ä¶ is that reliable?

I mean the battery is a consumable (at huge cost) and what life expectancy?‚Ä¶ and what if the manufacturer ceases to support/update the vehicles systems, preventing it‚Äôs intended operation with updated infrastructure?!?",2024-06-04T03:25:17Z
