2024-05-04,-f_LV-6PuFA,40k in australia right now
2024-06-12,-f_LV-6PuFA,bought one last week same colour and top gt spec
2024-02-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,"do not buy this car i own one and intend to do a review after having one for 24 months here are my thoughts  i own the gt one so take this 

pros

 looks  they look great inside and out its the bestlooking peugeot theyve ever designed 
 extras as standard again im speaking about the gt model but you get almost all the extras as standard including heated seats auto foldin wing mirrors sunroof cruise control laneassisted cruise control  drives itself on motorway collision avoidance and detection  led lights with auto high beam proximity key unlock and smartphone charger usb ports reversing and parking assist camera 
 boot space decent boot space for the size of car
drive its a really nice car to drive thanks to comfort 
charging  ccs charging which is great when on longer trips 

cons  and there are plenty 

 range the range is pathetic really mine is the 2021 model and on full charge you are looking at 200 miles range on the clock  in reality you get no where near that probably 150 miles at a push in winter uk you might be as low as 100 miles on full charge for context my commute is 34 miles there and back 3 days a week mostly motorway at under 70 mph and i do about  50 miles social driving so roughly 150  200 miles a week on i have to charge at least twice a week i dont speed and am pretty conservative  winter with frost you are looking at every other day you will not get 150 miles on a round trip if its a mixture of motorway and urban  also driving eco does practically nothing in terms of range improvements 

 price you could get a tesla for the same price doesnt look as nice but for performance and everything else tesla wins its probably overpriced for what it is 

 software  the peugeot app is the single worst app i have ever used i could write a full comment on that it doesnt connect it logs you out fully you have to enter the pin and then log back in sometimes you have to uninstall the app because it just wont work if you want to precondition the battery on a cold morning you better set aside 5 minutes of waiting its unbelievably slow to connect to your car and then performing any operation is even slower 

and get this  you should precondition your battery when its cold it improves the range but you cannot precondition the battery if its less than 50 i think this is the only car that does this nor can you plug in your car and set it to precondtion overnight it just doesnt work 

service intervals are set in km although the odometer is in miles so the first time i took mine in for service was told it wasnt needed  i have seemingly random service intervals now 

you cant charge to a certain like other evs as other suppliers do not recommend 100 charge 

you have to plug in a usb to update car software even though it can connect to wifi and services 

sometimes you get prompts in french particularly errors which is useful 

trip information updates randomly often not at all 

it doesnt update the service history even though the log is now digital

your phone will pull up high battery use for the app as its not optimised 

you can only register one phone per car even if you have more than one driver 

there have been no major updates the whole time i owned the car despite the fact everyone that uses it hates it 

interior  the touch screen is pretty unresponsive and although you get a larger screen theres a pointless alwaysthere aircon widget on either side of the screen so you lose about 20 of the screen which is small as it is  the wireless phone charger is not angled properly as such you may think your phone is charging but if its not on the sweet spot it wont be 

build quality just coming up to the 3rd service interval and have been had several faults appear in the past week resulting in around 1k of charges luckily mine is a lease and under warranty repairs needed include new ball joints new brake pads despite using the engine breaking 80 of the time an electrical error not sure what it was just told by dash to take to dealer heated seats stopped working 

the green accent paintwork on the badge for the ev cars which they have since discontinued on  has flaked off 

so in summary looks great drives great range is poor its overpriced and has seemingly been overlooked for the evonly parts 

get something else for the price and forego looks"
2024-02-23,-f_LV-6PuFA,only 136ps
2024-01-10,-f_LV-6PuFA,does it show the charge  and remaining battery capacity as standard on the displays yet
2024-06-12,-f_LV-6PuFA,yh
2023-12-31,-f_LV-6PuFA,would still rather have my niro ev level 4  it has all heat and ventilated seats and steering wheel and both electric front seats and far more space in the back 
2023-12-13,-f_LV-6PuFA,what about 10k off list pricewhich is what they are available at now must be selling well
2023-10-06,-f_LV-6PuFA,watching the review i wouldt consider this vehicle at the priceor at 5k less than the current price tag
2023-10-02,-f_LV-6PuFA,i dont know who would buy that for 40k
2023-10-01,-f_LV-6PuFA,the 2008 had the worst suspension i have ever felt on a modern car when i test drove it 2 years ago i hope the ev version improves it because it is otherwise a nice looking car
2023-10-14,-f_LV-6PuFA,what did you find so bad
2023-09-30,-f_LV-6PuFA,peugeot make nice looking cars but theyre expensive and residuals are shocking so no sane person would buy one
2023-09-29,-f_LV-6PuFA,nobody has yet explained the point of ev as environmentally it makes no sense am talking the whole process of everything to make an ev from digging to get at raw materials too what powers the charges etc etc etc  just wish all you car shows asks serious question or are you afraid that you be cancelled by the governmentmanufactures seems to me the only honest personcompany to this question is toyota yes they make ev but they still ask the question
2023-10-21,-f_LV-6PuFA,yupno raw materials dug out of the ground for oil drilling is there
2023-09-29,-f_LV-6PuFA,37k for that junk
2023-09-28,-f_LV-6PuFA,"doesnt have full one pedal driving no frunk far slower steel wheels and fairly low range this doesnt really beat the niro ev or kona ev in any way except looks 
even the boot is far smaller than both of those cars"
2023-09-28,-f_LV-6PuFA,ugly like the favourite child
2023-09-28,-f_LV-6PuFA,fugly
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,do e3008
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,whoa hideous and electric 
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,overpriced and youll be hammered on residuals
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,well i drive an e208 so basically have a smaller brother of this its a really nice car but as residuals are showing now its way overpriced and this refresh doesnt change that one bit given youll be able to get a one year old for 23k in a years time im amazed anyone would buy this privately maybe they give huge discounts and low rate finance now
2023-09-28,-f_LV-6PuFA,its mostly being leased around here
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,its such a major no go for me in cars that automatic gear sticks are turning into something so absolutely ridiculous as a lille switch besides the car looks great but sadly the car will likely be way overpriced
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,hmmm  push for the kia niro ev  better range and much faster
2023-09-28,-f_LV-6PuFA,yep also has full one pedal driving a frunk and far more luxuries like ventilated seats on the top spec
2023-09-29,-f_LV-6PuFA,kiahyundais also have so much more recalls
2023-10-11,-f_LV-6PuFA,"the problem with the kia eniro is the slower charging speed 
my ev road trip planner calculates faster trip with an faster charging citroën ec4 with shorter range than a slower charging with longrange kia eniro for a 1000 mile trip"
2023-11-19,-f_LV-6PuFA,tomtom9879 i agree that the slower charging on the niro is disappointing  i dont even get the advertised 77kw  ive never had more than 53kw fortunately i dont do many journeys more than 240 miles and charge at home
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,range price you gotta be kidding me no thanks
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,as always with psa the cars are designed to be electric or gas or hybrid probably because stellantis cio is always lobbying to postpone the switch to evs to maximise short term profits and his huge incomes so this car is a compromise and it cannot be the best and sadly this strategy does not even make this car cheaper so it is for people who are really in love with the brand
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,why are people still mentioning psa they combined with stellantis years ago friend and peugeot is one of many of the stellantis brands who are leading the way in the switch to fully ev
2023-10-03,-f_LV-6PuFA,lhawkesdrumsthe didnt combine they became stellantis the name didnt exist before
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,too expensive by about 10k   steel wheels    why a massive grill for an electric car  hump between the rear seats  why just why  oh i know why because  peugeot seem set on just using ice vehicles and then slapping an electric motor in and calling it good rather than actually designing  electric vehicles from scratch like the car manufacturers in china are doing
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,looks very smart  as peugeot products do these days no interest in the ev version petrol version for me which is what ive ordered
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,can i ask why you would order these new considering their price falls second hand after a year
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,for me the biggest improvement is the fact it has the letter e in front of it im not a fan of pointless front grills on evs though
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,just another stellantis compliance clone
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,why on earth does a front wheel drive electric car still have the remnants of a transmission tunnel cluttering up the rear floor  this car is an overpriced hangover of the past come on stellantis youre nearly there with the astra lets have an all electric reasonably priced giulietta replacement a smallish light car that looks good and is fun to drive in fact everything an alfa should be and not a very expensive big suv like the tonale or the stelvio
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,because stellantis cio plans to sell new ice cars for as long as possible even after 2035 in europe with the help of more and more lobbying so no plateforme dedicated for evs at peugeot
2023-09-29,-f_LV-6PuFA,or because this platform have been used for 4 yrs and petrol models still sell at a much higher percentage buy the time of ice ban the next 2008 will be out on dedicated e architecture
2023-09-29,-f_LV-6PuFA,jackweednm1vq sure but it is the same minimum investment in evs it could be a good strategy if the result was lower costs but no this ev is not cheaper at the end of the day sells will be very low for this car while it is supposed to be new to mach the concurrence in 2023 you need dedicated ev plateformes
2023-09-29,-f_LV-6PuFA,didierpuzenat7280 but it doesnt seem worthwhile for manufacturers given the better selling dedicated evs id3 cupra born and fiat 500e have all had their production paused due to demand and were talking top 10 best selling evs i think the e2008 was the best selling electric bsuv for a period in europe it makes sense we are still early on in ev adoption as a percentage of total passenger vehicle sales it makes sense that a car past the point of facelift stage is not on dedicated ev architecture the next gen will be and before any bsuvs from a number of its competitors the epuma is yet to launch which wont be dedicated arochirecture and the e2008 is more than halfway through its lifecycle
2023-09-29,-f_LV-6PuFA,jackweednm1vq maybe there is indeed a lack of demand but not for evs since tesla sells are great so the goal for automakers should be to close the gap with tesla and soon chinese evs and it will be difficult when you have to make compromise because your plateforme must be compatible with an internal combustion engine for example it will be difficult to have a bigger battery in the e2008 or to switch to lfp however i am not saying that this e2008 is doomed just that is will mostly appeal to fans of the brand or people not well informed of what other brands have to sell eg because they are used to go to a peugeot dealer and of course for a few buyers with specific needs this e2008 will be the best car
2023-09-29,-f_LV-6PuFA,didierpuzenat7280 yes agreed all my explanation wasis is that the e2008 and been pretty well positioned for the last 4yrs and will remain competitive as this review explain for at least another two yrs then time for the new dedicated platform thats why i think its been a good strategy tesla also had the desirability of being totally electric not being a legacy for the early adopters who are into tech etc the legacy are better aligned for the remainder than will adopt more slowly secondly i still personally think theres space for a direct tesla competitor if were going to make more ethics and considered purchases tesla has draw backs elon also undermines the brand and his customer base but thats a separate issue
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA, is not called a hashtag
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,needs priced reduced by at least 6k if not more
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,the motoring industry has just become about how good the graphics are on screens 
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,hey guys why did you disable comments on your sponsored best home charger video
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,it seems really poor to charge for the heated elements of the car when the competition include them even in the base versions it strikes me that peugeot are still too far behind the koreans and the chinese this is an old technology car and nothing can disguise that its still doesnt have enough room for a disabled driver to fit a reasonable size wheelchair in the back or in the boot
2024-01-07,-f_LV-6PuFA,if china attacks taiwan as xi promised there will be no spareparts for chinese cars
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,what was the rattling noise i could hear on the interior driving shots
2024-01-07,-f_LV-6PuFA,from camera stand i have one and it doesnt rattle if you dont do your own tunings
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,nice car but pricey for what is basically a jacked up e208 and the wltp range is not as good as the kona niro ev and renault megane etech which are around the same price to compete with those it needs to be cheaper i personally would wait for the price to come down or better still get it second hand in about 2 years time
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,ill continue waiting for the tsunami of chinese evs to arrive in a few years to bring ev prices down to approx 20000no way im going to pay 36000 for a car
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,i wouldnt buy a chinese ev for patriotic reasons i prefer stuff made in europe or usa i agree with you these current evs are too expensive while not giving you much hoever finally there is one that might change this next gen 3008 will start selling in the next few months supposedly it will be the car with the longest range in the world when it comes to under 50 000 cars
2024-01-07,-f_LV-6PuFA,we are in war with china china is the only big supporter of russia in a war with ukraine do not buy any chinese brands whatsoever also no tiktok and if china attacks taiwan as xi promised there will be no spareparts for chinese cars
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,not as good as the hyundai kona
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,if it was priced right for what it does ie half price then why not
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,how dumb can you be
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,what a mess
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,steel wheels for over 35 grand 
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,garbage
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,price price price
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,omg it looks amazing like before full of allure and an unrivalled driving feel
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,the range is still small for the price of vehicle and no increased charging speed is not really much of an upgrade is it
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,not my cuppa tea stellantis powertrains have reliability issues and should the electronics fail which they will it is time to scrap the car
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,the petrol engines on these facelift cars are revised now chain drive
2023-10-29,-f_LV-6PuFA,thanks for this info are you talking from personal experience or seen official reports of the powertrain issues ill have a google and see what i can find out but was curious ive read the batterys have an 8yr warranty or up to 100000 but not sure on the rest of the car or the motor
2024-01-07,-f_LV-6PuFA,i have driven 35 years with peugeots there are very little to worry about only thing that is very important with timing belt in oil bath models use only total quarz oil that is recommended by peugeot no castrol no mobil no shell
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,"nope  
only petrol and 12 decades later hydrogen "
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,hydrogen is the technology of the future and it it always will be
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,hydrogen has no future for ground transportation neither cars bus trucks or even trains you need 5 times more electricity with a hydrogen car than with a battery car so 5 times more wind turbines andor solar panels and of course at least 5 times more money to drive not to mention the infrastructure to build while electricity is everywhere regarding petrol up to you but i guess that in less than 10 years nobody will want to buy a petrol car and maybe not even own one then the car makers that still rely on ice will go bankrupt and sadly the employes will be out of job without proper qualification for the new norm
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,i like the fiat 600e styling
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,smart but still to expensive
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,its getting way way to expensive
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,prefer the petrol
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,im not sure about the styling it used to look very good but now it is a bit overdone which makes it look like a chinese car  especially in white
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,totally agree the pre facelifted model looks better
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,agree looks like a transformer that cant make up its mind
2023-10-08,-f_LV-6PuFA,i love the new interior badge and tail lights but the front puts me off
2024-06-12,-f_LV-6PuFA,many chinese evs have amazing designs avatr nio human horizon zeekr etc etc
2023-09-27,-f_LV-6PuFA,ok
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,whod take this over a petrol or diesel 2008

2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,no thanks
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,if it were cheaper i recently sold my zoe and bought an 8 year old petrol sports car after 3 years  it was good if a bit dull to drive and look at i usually buy cars about five years old and i think once they have depreciated a bit they will be great buys because theres so little to go wrong love peugeot interiors these days i would have this over the petrol or diesel version every day
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,roger unwin petrol version will be worth a couple of quid in a few years  wouldnt touch them or diesel now no matter what theyre finished as brand new cars  only if you want to run one second hand
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,if these were sold in canada i would definitely take the electric over a petrol or diesel version the total cost of ownership will be cheaper in the electric
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,"absolutely 100 for sure
ive only been an ev driver for about 8 months in a 4 years old leaf but i would have no hesitation in recommending an ev to anyone looking for a change of car  they are so quiet and relaxing to drive yet have such instant acceleration in  around town where it can be really helpful plus even compared to the 55mpg prius hybrid i had before my fuel cost is about a 14 of what i was spending on petrol  and im not even on the cheapest electricity tariff either
evs are absolutely the way forward 
my only caveat would be get something with around a 200 mile wltp range as the driver will need a comfort break before the battery is empty  my 100 mile leaf is just a little compromised on a longer motorway trip not unusable by any means but longer trips just need a bit more wheretochargeonroute planning"
2020-10-07,ccpD3Xod_iQ,me
2020-10-08,ccpD3Xod_iQ,"hell yes ive bought my last ice car from here on it will be evs

i wouldnt buy this particular ev the id3 suits me better but that wasnt what you asked"
2020-10-08,ccpD3Xod_iQ,i can  feel the true happiness that u expressed  258for that mobile phone holding  practical  clever design love frm india 
2020-10-16,ccpD3Xod_iQ,robsmith1a im curious to know what sports car you bought  the zoe is a great car but pretty much everything is sportier i imagine
2020-10-16,ccpD3Xod_iQ,eoghanfla6343 i bought a mercedes slk 62 reg i like having the glass roof as well as it being convertible and it is pretty good looking to my eyes i know a lot of hard core petrolheads find it a little soft but each to his or her own
2020-11-27,ccpD3Xod_iQ,no costs far more than the petrol version and importantly charging times and availability of charging points is a dealbreaker for now  of course charging technology will improve although consider how queues build up at busy petrol stations then imagine how much worse it will be when each ecar needs at least 5 minutes to fuel up  charging over night at home doesnt sound viable for people living in flats or those without drivewaysgarages

2021-02-11,ccpD3Xod_iQ,roger unwin people who buy this like me wouldnt buy a petrol or diesel version wed buy a different electric car
2021-10-16,ccpD3Xod_iQ,rory dont ask petrol heads stupid questions
2022-02-17,ccpD3Xod_iQ,roger unwin with petroldiesel and maintenance cost over the life of the car it would be much cheaper
2022-03-16,ccpD3Xod_iQ,couild i drive across europe id be worried about finding charging ports
2022-09-04,ccpD3Xod_iQ,im really liking this  yes i would definitely buy one the id3is too plasticy the model 3 too bland
2024-07-01,ccpD3Xod_iQ,i was sold on the citroen e c4 before this car
2024-06-19,ccpD3Xod_iQ,i quite like the steering wheel
2024-03-05,ccpD3Xod_iQ,didnt show if the back seats fold down flat or stick up which is annoying when requiring a flat storage area
2024-02-12,ccpD3Xod_iQ,this is absolutely junk it only does 50 of stated range falls apart and you waste your money this is from my experience and the financial ombudsman agreed do not purchase and waste your money
2024-01-10,ccpD3Xod_iQ,"you are lucky to have rory auto trader 
good car then but i doubt its 200 mile range so i cant consider getting one also what about servicing it can a normal mechanic service one"
2023-08-27,ccpD3Xod_iQ,rory excellent job on this review  i have never before commented on a review before but this one is excellent  not sure if i will purchase an e2008 but the information given is concise and helpful  very impressed by your style an knowledge of your subject  thank you
2023-06-17,ccpD3Xod_iQ,ive got a 125 mile round trip motorway commute  is this car capable of this
2023-05-01,ccpD3Xod_iQ,"not everybody has 60000 to spend on a car
very true but even if you do have the money not everybody wants to spend 60000 on a car
if thats the thing that makes you happy go for it but to many people a car is a practical object to get you from a to b so if you can do that safely in comfort and quick enough in a nice looking car that costs half of that amount theres really no need to spend more"
2023-03-07,ccpD3Xod_iQ,love thisthankyou ive decided to go for 1
2023-03-01,ccpD3Xod_iQ,my wife has just got one as her work car and after driving it for a few weeks id agree with everything he says
2022-11-17,ccpD3Xod_iQ,first time ive seen one of your reviews and im impressed with your no nonsense straight to the point review great work
2022-10-26,ccpD3Xod_iQ,this is an older video would you say it still makes sense to buy this car at the moment or are there many better options for the price thanks
2022-10-20,ccpD3Xod_iQ,how do you reach the control to reinitiate tyre pressure it just doesnt seem to exist the control panels are so difficult to use
2022-09-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,wish this was in anerica
2022-08-07,ccpD3Xod_iQ,anyone know if peugeot  use a lfp battery in the e208 and e2008
2022-04-18,ccpD3Xod_iQ,060 in 9 seconds pathetic piece of crap my 1990 mini van was faster and this is new electric car  thank god there is tesla
2022-04-11,ccpD3Xod_iQ,great review one of my favourite car reviewers easily can you review the new peugeot 308
2022-03-27,ccpD3Xod_iQ,i love the small steering wheel i went from a peugeot to a seat and instantly missed the small wheel not sure what it is it feels more responsive and alive also the puretech engine takes some beating far better than most tsi engines that seem rather lethargic
2022-03-21,ccpD3Xod_iQ,its an octagon
2022-03-11,ccpD3Xod_iQ,cheers
2022-03-08,ccpD3Xod_iQ,that instrument visual problem suddenly the old citroen one spoke steering wheel becomes a stroke of genius also the steering wheel in the original c4 with the fixed centre makes it so much easier to find the controls if your wheel is turned or turning but i have to say i tried the peugeot steering wheel and loved it for handling
2022-03-03,ccpD3Xod_iQ,i like that fact that rory isnt scared to give the car a good caning thru the  corners very informative
2022-02-22,ccpD3Xod_iQ,so which would you buy the e 2008 or the citroen e c4  or something else in this price range cheers
2021-12-11,ccpD3Xod_iQ,wheres the cd player
2021-11-27,ccpD3Xod_iQ,just picked our up love it
2021-11-24,ccpD3Xod_iQ,the dash is messed up being so low the buttons looks terrible thanks for the cover
2021-11-23,ccpD3Xod_iQ,"some thoughts
1 must be nice to have money for this sort of thing
2 regen braking once you lift off fine but do remember your brake lights are poking the driver behind you into defensive action every time you consciously or unconsciously do that which i can say from experience is exhausting

2021-06-21,ccpD3Xod_iQ,the wheel has been that way a long time for peugeot cars and therefore seems very much intentional not as an ad hoc fix for low instruments

2021-01-17,ccpD3Xod_iQ,any ev that dont hit the 250 mark in range really makes me resist purchasing that vehicle good thing my niro gets 268 on a full charge
2021-06-03,ccpD3Xod_iQ,id be happy with most cars over 180miles of range having been driving evs for a couple of years now that said i love that i got 256 miles out of my zoe 50 the other day never have to worry about charging that thing
2021-01-07,ccpD3Xod_iQ,the idea that there arent that many electric suvs i find that quite strange theres only a single 1 electric wagonestate available in europe and thats only in the uk for now so as family cars go all cars except one are suvs

2020-12-23,ccpD3Xod_iQ,"i have taken delivery of this car this week and have jotted down some things that annoy me

 ev charger wont pull out if you dont do it immediately after unlocking if you fail you then have to close all doors and the boot lock the car and unlock it again a nightmare if you have kids or passengers 
 bottom of doors inside the car get dirty  water makes its way in somehow
 kwph graph on the infotainment totally pointless as its y axis scale goes to 120kwh per mile stupid as youll only ever get between 25 so the graph is miniature and therefore pointless 
 mypeugeot app took ages to connect  like a week and its an incredibly clunky process 
 apple carplay cancels any radio station youre listening to and just sits there in silence until you go all the way through settings and find radio again
 no setting for defaul blower speed so it always comes on max which is both loud and unpleasant trying to change it is a real faff with all the touchscreen ui 
 water runs in boot if you open it whilst the car is wet
 cant set pre condition temperature  so even after i got the app working you cant select a temperature youd like to set the car decides for you usually around 22 degrees so much for setting it to be like a fridge when youre 10 mins away from your car and its 38 degrees outside"
2020-12-15,ccpD3Xod_iQ,nice video myself i have an electric volkswagen and i am looking for a new ev thanks for sharing this video its very informative i also thought i will share where i found good quality and affordable ev cables compared with other companies i found this one the best  httpsevchargepluscom
2020-12-01,ccpD3Xod_iQ,there arent that many electric suvs really almost all of the new emerging electric cars are suvs we have small electric cars and suvs if the car industry does not know there are people like me who need more space that an eup or zoe and hate all suvs so please make an estate thank you

2021-03-01,ccpD3Xod_iQ,somfilmsfhd honestly amazing car overall great performance practical spacious and just a simple car not too complicated being an electric 2021 car the only negatives i would say is the boot space is small and the range isnt the best especially for someone like me who hasnt got a home electric charger

2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,you lost me when you said it goes 204 miles once again car manufacturers keep pushing a product that does not work and its a few steps back from what petrol cars are and car reporters sell themselves making publicity to a product that its not ready for the normal working consumer and dont ask the right questions
2020-10-08,ccpD3Xod_iQ,how often do you do 200 miles per day most of the population do an average 168 miles per dayand while the car sits it charges
2020-10-08,ccpD3Xod_iQ,matthew railton hello actually i do it quite often the 200 miles range wouldnt be a problem if a charging network would be available everywhere the two typical situations where you would charge your car throughout the day are when the car sits at work and at home most workplaces dont have parking for their employees and much less charging stations most people dont have garage at home where they could charge so they would have to rely on public charging network which is poor and of low quality b speed charging speed charging is still a problem because it takes to long so if you need to make a long trip it will increase in a few hours the time to arrive to your destination a small business owner that relies on its car to go to place a to b as fast as he can an return electric car would be a problem also because charging network still is of poor quality and small tesla network aside you can even find yourself having to wait a few hours along the way not only when you charging but even to get a spot to charge your car finally charging cost typically if you charge at home it will be cheaper to run an electric car than a ice car but if you have to rely on public network thats no longer the case specially you you use the ionity network

the truth is only one ev cars are not ready yet to take over as the new form of transportation cars manufactures are pushing electric cars to consumers not because they think that technology is ready but because they know that they are obliged to reduce carbon emissions so they push expensive cars to avoid tax penalties i really wish that evs are the solution but as of right now they are not"

2020-10-08,ccpD3Xod_iQ,bcol127 i am and its a deal breaker for me the fact that it struggles to pull after 40 concerns me with merging over taking and other situations where having adequate pulling power could impact safety in certain situations most non performance carscuvs in this price range pull consistently to at least 60 to 80 mph
2020-11-11,ccpD3Xod_iQ,calmdownshh as an owner of the e golf 2018 which is heavier and 2hp less i can say that overtaking at 60 mph can be done just fine without any stress they er quite agile and surprisingly enough power to get you through traffic no they are not powerful but plenty enough so if thats the only deal breaker for you then buy this car

2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,rory great job as usual no unnecessary talking straight to the point sweet and simple you have to be one of the best that has ever did the job
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,great looking car with a semiluxury interior decent range and a good price for the tesla fanatics that expect such level of equipment and quality for a similar price wait another 10 years
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,it will take the software apfsd battery tech and performance another 10 years to catch up to the tesla model 3
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,jam_2024  peugeot and the other brands will reach sooner tesla sw than tesla will catch in the quality department and tesla performance is nothing special  vw is already there with porsche  a far better performance car and id3 and id4  far better value for the money
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,lea82345 ya except the porsche costs double the price of the model s lol as for peugeot they are unreliable and break down id3 and id4 have tons of cheap plastic and poor software they are also behind in efficiency and range vw tesla and maybe a few other companies will be still be around in the next 10 years nobody gives a crap about peugeot
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,"jam_2024 peugeot has more evs in their range than tesla delusional prick psa group sell 78 times more cars than  trashla they are merging with fca and in the next ten years will be one of the biggest companies in the world taycan is twice the car model s is and it is not twice as expensive vw id4 has more range than model y while id3 has almost the same range as model 3 lr despite being a hatchback and 10 000 euros cheaper
do not talk about interior quality tesla moron your cars have the cheapest plastic on the planet"
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,lea82 lol someone sounds upset  nobody cares about an unreliable slow car with slow laggy software
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,jam_2024 somebody still judging a car company by their reliability 15 years ago i see you do know that tesla generally props up or sits right towards the bottom of reliability tables right
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,"lea82345 software engineer here and ill tell you straight up that its a _lot_ harder to build a good software design culture and set of practices than you think it is

additionally go and investigate the munro teardowns of teslas and youll find that their culture of continuous iteration is already accomplishing things that traditional automakers cant touch tesla does quite a few traditional manufacturing things worse than legacy automakers but their rate of improvement is _dizzying_  trust me no one in automotive engineering takes them anywhere near as lightly as naysaying laypeople do"
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,"stephandolby dont treat reliability like a single metric the things that really matter on a tesla battery and drivetrain have fewer points of failure than their ice equivalents

likewise the manufacturing quality at teslas shanghai plant is already better than their fremont site is anyone prepared to bet that their german manufacturing quality wont be even better dont just judge tesla by their hereandnow judge them by their trajectory there is precisely one auto manufacturer on earth that is currently making an admittedly slim profit selling evs every other manufacturer is currently producing them at a loss see compliance cars comments elsewhere in this thread i agree that vw group is likely to be the first of the traditional automakers to join tesla in that bucket but for now theres one clear volume and technology market leader in ev manufacturing and its not vw group"
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,can we stop using asthmatic as a way of saying weak please especially in a car that does not even breathe like an ice car  ta
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,well the only thing that would be better is stronger engine and a bit more range but otherwise not bad

2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,am gonna be honest im not a peugeot fan
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,nobody is really
2020-10-07,ccpD3Xod_iQ,jam_2024 plenty of people like peugeot
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,tesla model 3 starts at 39000 by the way
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,im really waiting for tesla car 25k
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,you will have to wait around 10 years thenand for what cheap plastic falling roofs and bumpers
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,lea82 this peugeot probably has better interior quality than a tesla
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,lea82345 maybe in 10 years their softwareinfotainment battery efficiency fsdap and performance will catch up to the 2017 model 3 or by then peugeot will be bankrupt like most legacy auto companies
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,jam_2024 you are delusional fanboy take your meds and go watch on carwow taycan spanking model s all day every day
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,307skylake7 of course it does
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,lea82345 lol triggered fanboy cant take the truth go have a few drinks and get back to bed taycan costs double the price what do you expect
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,q j no just awfully no if you lived in europe youd know that peugeot is one of the more popular brands here and not near bankruptcy if it goes bankrupt youll still see many on the road since the car brand is not a cheap heap of warming plastic like bmw
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,q j well coming from a porsche fanboy me the taycan is a bit expensive compared to teslas range and etc but this is porsches first try and also using more complex and different battery technology to teslas which make it much more harder and expensive to manufacture and porsches are made not for range and screen gimmicks its just for the appeal of driving a porsche which is handling speed and dynamics although porsches do have the upper hand in interior quality as well as said to last longer compared to teslas where they start to get glossy and cheaper in the future nonetheless there will always be progression but there is that extra tax with buying a german car sorry if my english is bad its not my first language
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,intel uhd graphics 630 your english is fine but my point remains the top end taycan is double the price of the top end model s so it better be faster and perform better in a race track but its software battery technology efficiency and apfsd cant even match a 2012 tesla model s they are way behind where it matters with evs porsche has been making cars for many decades tesla has not

2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,if it were cheaper i recently sold my zoe and bought an 8 year old petrol sports car after 3 years  it was good if a bit dull to drive and look at i usually buy cars about five years old and i think once they have depreciated a bit they will be great buys because theres so little to go wrong love peugeot interiors these days i would have this over the petrol or diesel version every day
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,roger unwin petrol version will be worth a couple of quid in a few years  wouldnt touch them or diesel now no matter what theyre finished as brand new cars  only if you want to run one second hand
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,if these were sold in canada i would definitely take the electric over a petrol or diesel version the total cost of ownership will be cheaper in the electric
2020-10-06,ccpD3Xod_iQ,"absolutely 100 for sure
ive only been an ev driver for about 8 months in a 4 years old leaf but i would have no hesitation in recommending an ev to anyone looking for a change of car  they are so quiet and relaxing to drive yet have such instant acceleration in  around town where it can be really helpful plus even compared to the 55mpg prius hybrid i had before my fuel cost is about a 14 of what i was spending on petrol  and im not even on the cheapest electricity tariff either
evs are absolutely the way forward 
my only caveat would be get something with around a 200 mile wltp range as the driver will need a comfort break before the battery is empty  my 100 mile leaf is just a little compromised on a longer motorway trip not unusable by any means but longer trips just need a bit more wheretochargeonroute planning"

2020-10-16,ccpD3Xod_iQ,robsmith1a im curious to know what sports car you bought  the zoe is a great car but pretty much everything is sportier i imagine
2020-10-16,ccpD3Xod_iQ,eoghanfla6343 i bought a mercedes slk 62 reg i like having the glass roof as well as it being convertible and it is pretty good looking to my eyes i know a lot of hard core petrolheads find it a little soft but each to his or her own
2020-11-27,ccpD3Xod_iQ,no costs far more than the petrol version and importantly charging times and availability of charging points is a dealbreaker for now  of course charging technology will improve although consider how queues build up at busy petrol stations then imagine how much worse it will be when each ecar needs at least 5 minutes to fuel up  charging over night at home doesnt sound viable for people living in flats or those without drivewaysgarages

2020-10-08,ccpD3Xod_iQ,agreed they are especially silly when you consider that their hero elon himself has said that he welcomes competition since he knows that tesla cant possibly electrify the entire car industry in spite of this you seem to have more comments from angry tesla fans than from the regular evhating trolls under most ev reviews

2024-04-25,LWc9g7to9F0,was going to subscribe but the fact you push evs has put me off completely ev sales have collapsed because people have become aware of all the pit falls of them
2024-04-26,LWc9g7to9F0,thanks for the comment
2024-02-05,LWc9g7to9F0,lets hope the problems with onboard chargers in the e208 are fixed in the latest facelift not sure if the e2008 had the same issues
2024-02-06,LWc9g7to9F0,what was the problem
2024-02-06,LWc9g7to9F0,nevoevreviewireland lots of reports of onboard chargers needing to be replaced on corsae and e208
2024-01-28,LWc9g7to9F0,this is a beautiful new design i love it and will sure buy it l however the delivery time is around 3 months and that is quite long for me 
2024-02-06,LWc9g7to9F0,thanks for the info surprised its so long
2024-07-15,LWc9g7to9F0,thats a short wait some cars are over 6 months
2024-01-24,LWc9g7to9F0,thanks great review im getting my new e2008 end january in grey  looking forward to it your review spot on im getting the gt  thanks again
2024-02-06,LWc9g7to9F0,thanks tony safe travels
2024-04-26,LWc9g7to9F0,just wondering if you got your car and how you fid it so far im looking to get an ev one
2024-01-21,LWc9g7to9F0,i watched this review and headed off to test drive a 2008 this review failed to mention the badly compromised driving position of this car for a taller driver im around the same height and build as derek 188cm and there was no combination of steeringseat adjustments whereby i could see the driver display and avoid my knees hitting the steering column its an atrocious piece of design engineering in terms of ergonomics and functionality after an hour at peugeot it turned out that i cant comfortably fit in any peugeot model with a digit lower than 5 5008 and 508 were fine
2024-01-21,LWc9g7to9F0,thanks for the comment peter i always mention the steering wheeli cockpit viewing issues but not as much on this one apologise sorry to hear it doesnt work for you maybe the e3008
2024-01-21,LWc9g7to9F0,nevoevreviewirelandno problem derek i enjoy your reviews i just felt this was worth mentioning in relation to the 2082008 i would need a 5085008 to be comfortable with the peugeot cockpit set up
2024-01-18,LWc9g7to9F0,i think peugeot  stellantis are doing a fantastic job at building solid great looking cars and transitioning their fleet onto the new stla platforms well clearly see big range improvements with every technical facelift and new generation so i wonder who the today new 2008 and 308 will hold up in 10 years time
2024-02-06,LWc9g7to9F0,only time will tell
2024-01-09,LWc9g7to9F0,lovely car the problem for peugeot and renault is the price they cannot compete with the likes of mg or byd that give you so much more for lower prices smallish battery
2024-01-13,LWc9g7to9F0,i wonder will we see price adjustments
2024-01-14,LWc9g7to9F0,only time will tellnevoevreviewireland
2024-01-15,LWc9g7to9F0,the chinese government pays byd to build cars even without having customers to buy them they do this in order to get the market share it is virtually impossible to compete against this
2024-02-05,LWc9g7to9F0,wait for the offers to appear they are still inflating ev prices to protect ice sales perhaps i have no evidence for that though of course
2024-01-08,LWc9g7to9F0,informative video thanks
2024-01-09,LWc9g7to9F0,glad it was helpful
2024-01-09,LWc9g7to9F0,nevoevreviewirelandgoing to have to start measuring steering wheels now 
2024-01-07,LWc9g7to9F0,we have a 208 ev 2022 in ireland and it went in for the 15000km service and the dealer rang and wanted 80 for a pollen filter when i told them i have a service plan with the car the attitude changed then at 22000km we had to get the windscreen replace due to a large stone chip and when i went back to collect the car i was told that they cant calibrate the camera that there might be something wrong with the windscreen so i rang the crowd that put the windscreen and they told me to come in to them which is an hours drive and guess what they calibrated the camera in 20 minutes now the issue is the dealer handed back the car to a customer with some of the safety features not working thats not good and finally the car went in for the 30000km service and on the way home the service light came on so i checked the pollen filter and it wasnt changed thats some service from peugeot my guess is the car wasnt serviced they just stamped the book i made 2 complaints to peugeot ireland and nothing was done so we are finished with peugeot and we are finished with electric one filter to change and they couldnt even do that
2024-01-08,LWc9g7to9F0,not good for a brand that is trying to go premium anf put it up to the big three german premium brands i heard someone call peugeot mid premium but not doing themselves any favours with service like that
2024-01-08,LWc9g7to9F0,thats terrible i have a good dealer in the uk who has been excellent sounds like you just have a bad dealer on that one  the car itself is great
2024-01-08,LWc9g7to9F0,isuperted yeah the car has been perfect not 1 issue i know some dealers are not great but surely peugeot ireland should have done something its there loss
2024-01-09,LWc9g7to9F0,to think that as a customer you werent worth the price of a pollen filter overpriced filter too crap after service can completely turn someone against a brand such bad business practice good riddance to them whoever they were
2024-01-09,LWc9g7to9F0,richardwallace2458 what pisses me off is that we have a 3 year service plan with the car so we have payed for the services and they are getting the pollen filter for free because we have payed for it i can get a bosch pollen filter online for 20 for the car shocking treatment

2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"like if range is important to you  share if you think car makers should make evs from the ground up

the peugeot e2008 certainly looks the part but how does it compare to the other compact suv electric cars on the market its beautifully made and easy to drive but for a car with a usable battery of 45kwh you might expect a better real world range than this offers the inside is comfortable and it has a decent boot but it lacks a reversing camera and has some quirky internal lights that look flashy but are a bit distracting the e2008 is a decent effort but in an increasingly crowded market for compact suvs does it do enough you tell us

2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"as a peugeot salesman im confused as to the spec you have been given the allure does not have a camera but the gt line should have you dont have to go to gt to get a camera

looking at the model you have it is a gt line with options it has not got the alcantara interior but it does have the panoramic roof

real life range should be about 180 from personal experience in town but maybe a lot less on motorways also peugeot marketing has been using the wltp of 190200 not the nedc

the ambient lights colour can be changed and also lowered or turned off completely

there is a button on the end of the wiper stalk to show you your trips including mile per kwh 

love the vids and i would love to answer any questions you might have as someone who is actually dealing with these models on a daily basis its a shame that it just arrived and a peugeot rep didnt run through some of the controls and features with you things like the trip meter is something i would have shown you within the showroom let alone when you actually drive the car"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,1818joe thanks for that response joe and i cannot tell you the frustration level of knowing how to view the trip meter gggnnnn it is also part of the problem of not having the car for longer and also not doing enough research my fail but all that aside i genuinely loved the car
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,ive had this now for a month have had consistently  193miles on the range meter
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,our range has been averaging 170180 miles after about 1000 miles of normal not particularly careful driving including plenty of motorways
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,1818joe my thoughts entirely i have a 3008 gt line which i love but i have front and rear cameras front is an option and the focal sound system  i want the e3008 please
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,when they built the first cars and tanks they had reins because the horse mentality was so strong
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,robert have you forgotten about bmw i3 which was completely different vehicle by bmw and the chevrolet bolt
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,tucdh4df im impressed by that weve not come close to that yet what sort of driving and any tips to max the range
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,"400  290whmile is more like 345 mkwh which gives a range of only 155 miles if useable battery is 45kwh 
edit and you confirmed the calculated 155 mile range later in the video
thanks for the review "
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,lean factor reallly
2020-12-10,8J8pcx7GUr4,i love fully charged and the channel has been a big support  in helping me buy my first ev however this is sloppy journalism as most of roberts complaints about the e2008 are just factually wrong as robert has now admitted he didnt do his research properly or bother to work out the controls on the car therefore this is a bit harsh on peugeot and i do feel fully charged need to correct or redo this video but accurately and fairly this time
2021-03-01,8J8pcx7GUr4,"hi bobby i think its worth reminding people watching on these reviews that the cars built on the same platforms as ice cars are always less efficient than native evs eg leaf teslas zoe and hence youre going to pay the same price for whats a manufacturers first attempt also which is more energyhungry and prolongs the manufacture of the combined iceev platforms as you could be paying for a fully sorted ev 

if sustainability and efficiency is the goal i think theres enough choice on the market now to push people towards the native evs over retrofit evs like this much like fully charged used to encourage people to simply buy bevs over hybrids and rangeextenders  from a long suffering ev and battery engineer"
2024-06-29,8J8pcx7GUr4,what does it cost to go a charging station in the city to fully charge the battery from near 0
2024-05-08,8J8pcx7GUr4,this has just dropped 25000aud in price in australia at least making it one of the cheapest cars on the market its low enough to make it possible for me but after watching review after review and looking at the specs i just cant see the value even at that price poor range average performance ice chassis no reversing cameras and it cant even tow a trailer the byd atto 3 may not have the name but it sure has the features  guess im waiting for the next crop to hit our shores and hopefully the prices keep the downward trajectory
2024-02-12,8J8pcx7GUr4,i bought this nightmare of a car cental locking broke heater broke gearbox broke air con broke in all under a year and it only does 50 of stated range dont touch dont buy walk away avoid dont waste your money stick with ice carbut not a peugeot car ever
2024-02-01,8J8pcx7GUr4,jesus someone get that bloke some ketchup for the chip on his shoulder
2024-01-25,8J8pcx7GUr4,fab review
2023-12-10,8J8pcx7GUr4,i think people who get really low range on these cars is due to driving them fast and putting the heater or ac  on a lot
2023-10-04,8J8pcx7GUr4,pretty likely the replacement for my egolf
2023-05-08,8J8pcx7GUr4,good car but poor range not worth it considering the price difference the petrol is better for now
2023-04-30,8J8pcx7GUr4,so you charged it absolutely full and it said 130 miles but then after driving it many miles you say you have 124 miles left as a reviewer no as any car owner you should know the number on the display is calculated in several ways and depends massively on the way you drive it and where you drive it city or motorway so you shouldnt be pointing out only 130 miles instead of the projected 267 miles on the nedc standard which nobody uses everybody uses the wltp standard before youve actually driven it point is if you are looking to find negatives you will find them whether they are relevant and real or not this car isnt perfect but the perfect car will never be made so point out the faults but dont complain as if the car is rubbish because it has faults as that is how it comes over to me
2023-04-30,8J8pcx7GUr4,i know where youre going with its built for a combustion engine but theyve adapted it for an electric motor but if the design is nice is it really necessary for the car to scream out im an ev and what should that be then the front window on top of the front bumper so people would know there cant be a combustion engine there nothing wrong with having the car look like a car in my opinion the only thing not enough manufacturers do is take advantage of the extra available space in the frunk but that supposedly is partly because its harder expensive to fit in frunks and pass crash tests at least thats an explanation i heard from a smart executive who explained why theres only a tiny 15l frunk in the smart 1 and to come back to my first point the old tiny smart cars hardly had an engine compartment and they never became a success partly because they just looked weird to many people so now smart has changed directions and their new car although an ev looks like a car instead of a box on wheels
2023-04-22,8J8pcx7GUr4,how would this do for a family of 4 with a 4 and a 6 year old
2023-04-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,you could drive a solar powered car at 20 miles an hour all day long and it would be more energy efficient than a freaking candle but i still couldnt care less so your mpg to kwhkm comparison means nothing to me to be honest i drive a diesel with a 45l fuel tank and get 1000 kilometers of range out of it and fill up after around 800kms for conveniences sake and theres not really any chance in hell id consider making the switch to a car that i have to plug in every day drive 1 hour to my office and have to plug it in there again just so i can turn on the ac on my way back with some peace of mind
2023-04-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,"just try to imagine how many comments weve received almost word for word the same as this one you posted 
do you think anyone is interested in how far you can drive in a clunking dirty inefficient dated and incredibly dull old diesel
a machine that requires this country to import toxic expensive heavily subsidised fossil fuel from the most corrupt and corrupting regimes in the history of humanity
but forget all that if it means you can drive 1000 km without stopping while you leave a trail of genuinely poisonous gas behind you then screw everyone else you can drive a long way and fill up quickly oh silly me surely that is the single most important technical achievement the human race has ever achieved
never ever think outside your narrow blinkered little world at the impact your actions have on the rest of the population screw them all they dont matter as long as you can drive 1000 km non stop every freaking day then you just carry on sunshine no one gives a stuff bye"
2024-05-08,8J8pcx7GUr4,fullychargedshow i love this reply truer words never spoken
2023-03-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,"i have a had a e2008 since the beginning of march  i have not reset the trip since i got it and it am averaging 43mikwh over 400 miles of rural and town driving  highest temperature has been 9 degrees c

i believe i will get much better results in the summer"
2023-03-03,8J8pcx7GUr4,you can access and reset the trip meter pushing the top button of the right lever 
2023-01-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,we dont all want strip down we dont all want teslasmaybe some of us still want a transition vehicle
2022-12-11,8J8pcx7GUr4,"i just had one of these as a loaner while my diesel car was in for a service i have to say i thoroughly enjoyed driving it so much so that i just drove aimlessly around for a while just to experience it some more i liked the smooth linear power delivery and of course how quiet it was some have mentioned intrusive road noise but i didnt find it intrusive at all it rode quietly and smoothly and i drove over some very rough roads space inside was ok too im 6 and i found the space in the back seat behind me was more than adequate 
i did find visibility a little restrictive though the rear view mirror because of the sharply raked windscreen was half way down the windscreen and blocked a lot of the view to the left also i found judging the near side a bit tricky due to the high bonnet line so squeezing through narrow gaps in traffic was a little tricky at first but i quickly go used to it 
i also liked all the high tech in the car such as sat nav apple and google play reverse camera inductive charging for smart phones etc you couldnt ask for anything more
as for range i got it fully charged and in eco mode it had a range of 192 miles this went down to about 170 miles in normal and 150 i think it was in sport mode i found eco mode a bit sluggish and the accelerator required a fair push to get moving along nicely also heatingair con was restricted in this mode too normal and sport were more like an ice car and it was these modes i used most when i took it back eco mode was showing a range left as 100 miles i hadnt done 92 miles only about 50 but i had used normal and sport modes a lot and had the heating on so that must have been where the extra charge was used
to sum up i was quite impressed with this looks bigger than what it is little car and seriously considered considered getting one until i discovered the price the spec i had was a new allure premiumgt with just 300 miles on the clock it retailed at a fraction below 40000 thats a hefty price to pay for an electric motor and some lithium batteries i thought im still considering though  mainly to use locally which is most of my driving anyway and also because the tech intrigues me
this all electric car is not something to use if youre doing lots of motorway miles but they are a great city car and 95 or more of us do drive mostly locally as we all know they have no exhaust so dont pollute locally or wherever youre driving they simply move the pollution elsewhere ie the power station where the pollution can be dealt with in one place with various filters etc which is a big plus i think"
2022-11-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,we are currently renting one of these and as much as i think its a lovely car i am utterly confused by the milage we are getting  we are getting about 60miles on a full charge  yes after charge it says 160miles but as we start on a journey with it in eco mode and driving carefully with the meter constantly in eco boom the range drops like a stone  id love anyone to give us an idea of what we are doing wrong to get such poor performance as as car i love it
2022-09-14,8J8pcx7GUr4,the names are bit of a turn off many people would assume that the car is 14 years old based on that name and then youve got the e308 which makes even less sense
2022-06-30,8J8pcx7GUr4,what a shock a french designed car that has weird and inexplicable and annoying design features
2022-05-15,8J8pcx7GUr4,909 i am from russia thanks for advice
2022-05-10,8J8pcx7GUr4,is this the man from mythbusters
2022-04-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,the fact the car looks like a car was reason why i chose this one i massively dislike the general ev designs eqsclass mercedes one of the most horrible ones but id3 id4 too horror 
2022-04-04,8J8pcx7GUr4,as this and the mokka are basically the same car which would you prefer
2022-03-26,8J8pcx7GUr4,but distance and weather exists so here in sweden this winter the snow and the cold came fast stucked on the roads where foreign trucks with no winter tyres and electric cars
2022-03-26,8J8pcx7GUr4,ehhh or should everyone do that not consider distance climate charging places sorry that is retarded
2022-02-21,8J8pcx7GUr4,ive got this on lease for 2 years 280 a month with a 2500 deposit and its amazing
2022-02-04,8J8pcx7GUr4,would love to go electric but e2008 30000 ish  vs petrol 20000 ish for every day workers its petrol all the way electric cars way over priced for me
2022-01-24,8J8pcx7GUr4,110  perfect muttleys laugh 
2022-01-12,8J8pcx7GUr4,they are getting cheaper good and it is nice to lean on
2022-01-12,8J8pcx7GUr4,i have always had a liking for peugeot that looks cool no reversing camera because you can actually see out of the rear window
2021-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,this was an excellent review its one of the first reviews that was honest and to the point
2021-10-25,8J8pcx7GUr4,i am a fully charged fan and also like mr llewelyn but this is both at their worst an underresearched review thats overwhelmed by the rantfest about nondedicated ev vehicle architecture suvs in general legacy manufacturers ev pricing models etc mainly  valid criticisms but this was supposed to be a car review and somewhere an editor  director should have been doing both and either wasnt or was overruled the car review element of this was underwhelming
2021-10-02,8J8pcx7GUr4,that is the best honest review of this car ive seen thank you
2021-09-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,i like this one one except the bad range so many e cars are ugly like tesla 3
2021-08-31,8J8pcx7GUr4,"core design by sensible engineers ruined in many basic aspects by fashion obsessed designers
form wins out over functionagain
fail"
2021-07-08,8J8pcx7GUr4,so another equivalence is that this car has a 1 ½ gallon fuel tank approximately and depending on outside temperature that will take you 130 miles buildings evs for the sake of it is undermining the whole idea of sustainable transport
2021-07-07,8J8pcx7GUr4,whats under the hud 
2021-06-27,8J8pcx7GUr4,have you ever considered using your indicators
2021-06-22,8J8pcx7GUr4,"i currently have a kia niro phev  but changing soon  dont know whether to go for a e2008 or another niro 
can get the gt premium model  for the same monthly cost as the eniro 2 trim level with the 64kw battery which equates to about 100 miles extra range for the same price
e2008  looks a lot better than the niro though 
basically comes down to looks vs extra range"
2021-06-14,8J8pcx7GUr4,one nice feature of this car is the really quiet cabin it is quieter than the taycan remarkable for its price range
2021-06-13,8J8pcx7GUr4,i own this car an get 190 miles of range
2021-05-25,8J8pcx7GUr4,it is the only ev i have found today with a usable ground clearance  the range is fine and a bigger battery would need to be lower making the car heavy and pretty useless where i live
2021-05-12,8J8pcx7GUr4,the fact he couldnt work out how to dim the interior led mood light just tells me he done a shit review 
2021-04-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,how often does the software get updated can this be done automatically or does it need to visit the garage
2021-04-10,8J8pcx7GUr4,i normally like this channel but this one one of the worst videos youve made firstly not being able to find the trip meter when its just a simple button press second all trims above the alora trims have a reversing camera and third all of the psa group cars citron vauxhall et cetera have a complete range as the electric equivalents so all trim levels are made in the electrical lamps
2021-04-07,8J8pcx7GUr4,well for me the fact that the e2008 is still a normal car i a quality it as a normal interior i do not like the cars that are like coming from an other dimension i hate cars whiteout knobs yes i want knobs is that too much asking
2021-03-29,8J8pcx7GUr4,"130 miles on a full charge thats terrible 
long live kia  hyundai large battery cars with 280 miles
i cant say im impressed with the 2008e robert
my number one choice would be the esoul for price  range  speed  standard equipment  safety features it is a winner
great review though robert great channel
greetings from cumbria
stay safe and well"
2021-03-25,8J8pcx7GUr4,take some shit version for test you can take better optioned 2008 abd it comes with camera and all kinds of tech 
2021-03-23,8J8pcx7GUr4,my 10 year old focus can drive over 559 miles on one tank of gas how far can the e2008 go
2021-03-21,8J8pcx7GUr4,these ev need to hit 250 miles real world  before i bite
2021-03-16,8J8pcx7GUr4,i love this car
2021-03-10,8J8pcx7GUr4,i love the way robert hates ice cars i do too
2021-03-10,8J8pcx7GUr4,electric cars are great  eficient and clean but peugeot has something extra  a cool design what more do you want from a car
2021-03-10,8J8pcx7GUr4,nice channel questionable presenter shame
2021-02-25,8J8pcx7GUr4,"yeah evs are are on the march global pr media army is doing its best to persuade people how evs are the next best thing after fire and maybe hot water but in reviews like this is i miss more balanced views for example many of us think evs are really soulless and dull vehicles when driving is considered driving an ev for me is like driving a car in a computer game much too often very soft and lukewarm on general feedback from road brakes or steering wheel booooring i also wonder if mr robert is really satisfied with countless waiting hours needing for battery to refill ok he uses fast chargers and drives these cars on automotive companies cost so it is easy to understand his enthusiasm but what if he was just a common user who would drive only his nissan leaf of first generation would he still be so enthusiastic with slow charging and slow driving on highways managing cables every time he stop somewhere or paying a very high price for such a car yes yes i can hear you saying yeah let them doubters drive conventional vehicles and pay a lot for gasoline service etc  but if this ytb channel and everyone else lookalike were sincerelly objective and de facto independent from the car industry we would have witnessed a completely different or at least a more balanced presentation of these vehicles 
for example why dont we see proper comparisons and calculations with conventional vehicles of the same class andor price which in addition to always present battery range and acceleration to 100 kmh would also include top speeds waiting times for rechargingrefueling maybe expressed also in financial terms comparisons in speed averages how many evs do we see driving above 120 kmh on highways gasoline  electricity costs and most important price comparisons namely prices of evs are so excessive even if we take into account high price of batteries or savings compared to drivingowning conventional vehicles that up to eur 40000 evs are not very competitive and i did not take into account driving pleasures fast refueling times or cost of purchase and ownership divided on a longer period of time with conventional options fortunately despite the global pr media offensive we as users still have a freedom of choice and right now both mr robert and i in different parts of the world are enjoying themselves behind the steering wheel even if they are completely different"
2021-02-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,i test drove one of these  my wife liked it  reason for not buying  i had to duck to see left as the rear view mirror is stuck half way down the windscreen  ok im over 6 foot tall but still did the oompa loompas design this
2021-02-16,8J8pcx7GUr4,ooh not sure the cops will like seeing you driving with no hands on the steering wheel lol
2021-02-15,8J8pcx7GUr4,dad got a peugeot 4008 hybrid a while back and its quite lovely for what it is i love the smaller steering wheel very elegant and easy to use when i get back into the skoda the normal steering wheel looks absolutely gigantic i look forwards to the next generation of these cars a proper ev from peugeot would be very interesting
2021-02-11,8J8pcx7GUr4,i stopped watching when you said the petrol versions were appalling the 3 cylinder 12 petrol engines in this car are brilliant the rest of the car is the same and i like the fact it isnt an electric car but a converted fossil fuel car why do people assume that because i want an electric car i want it to be obvious my e2008 gt premium is arriving on 1st march and i cant wait
2021-02-01,8J8pcx7GUr4,we dont all want evs that look different to the ice versions robert some of us want a car that looks like a normal car but happens to run on batteries far too many evs try to look different and frankly they look downright ugly as a result compare the new skoda enyaq and in particular the interior to the vw id4 the former is lovely the latter looks like a toy skoda are now showing vw how to design an ev interior
2021-01-29,8J8pcx7GUr4,in regard to range do i have found that it appears to increase as the battery gets up to temperature through use
2021-01-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,front bumper of todays cars are too big electric suvs dont have radiators so what is the point of a huge front bumper this suv needs more ground clearance 20cm atleast i want to see a real off road ev
2021-01-16,8J8pcx7GUr4,"waiting for a different designer to make an electric car not like a petrol carthe bmw i3 robert
8 years old designed and engineered for electric nothings been built like it since and it still looks more futuristic and fresh than any other wheels in each corner short blunt overhangs crf tub ultra lightweight its brilliant shame no ones had the gumption except vw now with the id3 to do one teslas are 3 box design"
2021-01-15,8J8pcx7GUr4,"ok get the electric version as its much much better but is it much much more expensive id love an ev but until i can get one for 25k on the road i wont well keep our 15 year old 4wd

just looked up prices e208 starts from 26k pounds diesel petrol from 15k pounds  

so you can buy another car with the difference

i love evs and desperately want one but why do manufacturers keep making them over priced i know batteries are just too expensive right now 

thats why they add all the luxury trimmings which cost next to nothing but gives more perceived value"
2021-01-15,8J8pcx7GUr4,according to the peugeot website all except the entry level model come with a reversing camera as standard
2020-12-24,8J8pcx7GUr4,great looking car but the price difference between petrol and electric is circa 12000 thats enough for 90000 miles of spirited driving the electric version needs to be closer in price
2020-12-22,8J8pcx7GUr4,id like to know how much it costs to charge one of these things when i fill my 2010 honda crv which will be my last ice car it costs about 55 good for about 450 miles or so the financial angle is important to a lot of people
2020-12-22,8J8pcx7GUr4,"okay heres a quick breakdown of how much 450 miles can cost in an electric car
if the car does around 4 miles to the kilowatt hour the peugeot e2008 would manage that for 9 months of the year in the uk and you charge at night on an off peak tariff i pay 5p per kwh overnight then its going to cost just over a penny a mile
450 miles would be in the 5550 range
if you charge on daytime tariff say 15p per kwh that would cost about 1650 for 450 miles
if you only used rapid chargers 24p per kwh then it would set you back about 28 for 450 miles
then the most expensive electricity you can buy is from ionity chargers they are very fast and they charge 69p per kwh
this means 450 miles would cost 77 so yes it is possible to pay more for electricity than it is for fuel
but one final point if you get an ionity card then you only pay 8 per charging session regardless of how much electricity you consume so clearly youd only use an ionity touch to pay charger and pay 69p per kwh in an emergency"
2020-12-23,8J8pcx7GUr4,"fullychargedshow thanks fyi what flipped me to go electric was working for a month in bangalore and experiencing severe air pollution by midday my lungs and airways would be raw and sore my eyes streaming 
my next car will definitely be powered by lightning rather than exploding dinosaurs"
2020-12-21,8J8pcx7GUr4,i feel that all the comments dissing the range over and over is a bit of an icehangover as well i think way too much emphasis is put on fast charging and range  essentially comparing to the ice experience on road trips some people might drive far often but most dont why not focus on how the car does for urban everyday driving and shoot in a note on what to expect on long trips this car has enough range to handle everyday urban driving for almost everybody and the reasonably fast charging makes the occasional long trip quite ok after having a tesla model 3 for 3 months we used superching for one trip i think its time to stop downplaying midrange evs from a resourceperspective and in a world where electric cars are battery starved these cars should not be downplayed like this
2020-12-13,8J8pcx7GUr4,you should do a review as crichton
2020-12-12,8J8pcx7GUr4,lets compare comfortably impressive with exceptional the former seems more easily achieved and totally acceptable ijs  im just sayin
2020-12-11,8J8pcx7GUr4,i dare say someone else has picked it up but this thread is very very long so at the risk of repeating someone elses comment 290wh per mile see 4m point in video is 1000290   345 miles per kwh not more than 4 how could it possibly be more then 4 for a car of its type sorry robert

manufacturers have got to stop fibbing about range make it law"
2020-12-07,8J8pcx7GUr4,maybe have a look on the spec of the car before testing it  this review is not professional at all never seen such a level of amateurism when it came to review this car
2020-12-07,8J8pcx7GUr4,you really sounded like a boomer the entire review haha

2020-11-29,8J8pcx7GUr4,i have an e208 and i think i know the reason why robert has been getting less predicted range if i have been driving my e208 on the highway it would need a few days for the range to readjust to the lower consumption of city driving the range estumation doesnt change rapidly when you go from high to low consumption and i think this was intentional  so your range prediction doesnt change rapidly up and down all the time and stress you mind you i use abrp to plan my trips so i dont really care about shown range  cheers
2022-09-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,abrp
2020-11-27,8J8pcx7GUr4,this looks like a very biased review i totally disagree with his comments on the look of the car i dont want an electric car that says im electric to the contrary i want a goodlooking car that is as normal as can be as for range he may have had a faulty model most people mention 180 miles of range under normal circumstances
2020-11-27,8J8pcx7GUr4,that is going to make a nice chrysler in about 18 months
2020-11-26,8J8pcx7GUr4,i have ordered a gt line my daily commute to and from work is 28 miles and weekend around 40 to 45 miles each day on a very busy weekend so realistic iam looking at around 220 miles a week so a month around 880 miles if i only get 150 miles out of a full charge which i think is a bit low looking at all the evidence thats just under 6 full charges a month my electric supplier after 1230am till 0400am charges 005p per kwh this means less then 20 a month i honestly cant remember when i last went on holiday in this country i live 2 miles from manchester airport and the last 30 years use this for my travel needs if i cant plug a car in 6 times a month on my drive and set it via the app to start charging at 0030 in the morning there is something seriously wrong with me and i shouldnt be allowed to drive on public roads if the average driver takes time and thinks about their average distance spent in their cars each month they will soon realise that the obsession with range is just something everyone else seems obsessed with and the average person could easily live with any electric vehicle
2023-01-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,very well said
2020-11-26,8J8pcx7GUr4,do you watch on the road itv 4 theyve just tonight  26th reviewed the peugeot 2008  both the petrol and electric variations side by side and  spoiler alert  refreshingly for a tv motoring show they were positive about the electric version
2020-11-26,8J8pcx7GUr4,would be interesting to see a final thoughts vid before you kick it back to peugeot
2020-11-22,8J8pcx7GUr4,i got my e2008 nearly a month ago  loving it so far
2020-11-24,8J8pcx7GUr4,what sort of range are you getting
2020-11-24,8J8pcx7GUr4,themanwithinflatableknees8770 at the moment 120m from a full charge  although its getting higher as my driving style has to adapt
2020-11-22,8J8pcx7GUr4,"working on those figures i would need three of them to drive from croydon to portreath in cornwall 
at fifty miles an hour other than that its a nice car"
2020-11-22,8J8pcx7GUr4,so far a lot of electric suvs instead of compactsedan cars
2020-11-22,8J8pcx7GUr4,"im not sure what robert is complaining about when he says it looks like an ice car and not something designed from the ground up as electric exactly what is it missing that it should have or conversely what has it got that it shouldnt  in relation to ice vs ev

this is not the first time this complaint has been made and i dont understand it what are the designers missing that is apparently so important

i can only conclude that the use of regular instruments and gauges in the position accepted by all except tesla as the best location ie in front of the driver is what causes robert to complain he is a tesla owner and it appears to make him think any car with information display in the traditional location ie in front of the driver is dated i know he had a model s but now a model 3 which he loves and i think leads him to mistakenly believes that all evs should now have an ipod stuck on the middle of the dash and nothing else with which to control the car

in fact the reason why most cars have their info display in front of the driver is because ergonomically its the best place i know you can get used to turning your head to see the tesla ipod but that is not as convenient as simply dropping your eyes thats why every manufacturer designs their cars that way except tesla as the last 100 years of auto design have concluded that in front of the driver is indeed the best place then tesla come along and have to be different and being more computer oriented than car manufacturer they mistakenly think one big single touch screen display in the middle of the dash is a cool idea no its not its a stupid place to have everything and touch screens are a nightmare to use while driving especially on a rough road

i dont hate tesla at all and admire them greatly but their choice of information display and control system as it is on everything bar the model s is dumb and the main reason i would not buy one

it all reminds me of the company that has probably influenced user interface design more than any other at least in this millennium  apple in the early days of the mac they wanted to encourage good software and ui design from their fledgeling developer community and published a book titled human interface guidelines to assist developers and ensure a coherent design for all mac software in this book i read the immortal phrase that i have never forgotten

consistency should be valued above idiosyncratic cleverness

in trying to be different and hence inconsistent with all other ui design of incar information displays tesla have displayed an appalling tendency for what i would actually term idiosyncratic stupidity being different is not a good thing when what you have made different is worse than what went before

but to return to the original point id be interested to hear what robert does think makes the peugeot too much like an ice car"
2020-11-22,8J8pcx7GUr4,"it is dangerous to compare energy efficiencies between petrol and electric without taking in consideration the total chain of energy transformation from primary to final product whats in your electrical car battery is the almost final product as you have the efficiency of the engine to consider as well whilst for petrol the engine efficiency is pretty poor 25 to 35  depending on the technology

for the electricity used you need to consider how it was produced transported and stored which is complex as the electricity you store in your batteries could be generated from many different sources  gas coal nuclear hydro wind solar

for petrol or diesel you have to consider the efficiency in its extraction transport and refining

i guess what would be more important to consider is the primary source of the electricity generation the losses in its transport and storage

also something that is not mentioned enough is the weight of cars in general which is not helped by the heavy batteries needed for long ranges the heavier the car the less energy efficient it will be"
2020-11-22,8J8pcx7GUr4,if kona and eniro compact suvs can do 280 miles of range easily why are we constantly seeing new compact suvs that dont get anywhere near this i know not everyone needs this but surely it could be an option on all compact suvs i find a lot of new electric vehicles are content just to be somewhere in the ballpark they dont even want to compete this market is still disappointing me to me there should be 4 or 5 cars at least coming out each year that should be tempting me away from my current electric car kia eniro  nothing holding a candle to it in the same price range currently  still love watching though
2020-11-22,8J8pcx7GUr4,hate to say this but based on the comments isnt this review very inaccurate according to existing owners mileage is much better than he claims trip computer is available there can be a reverse camera and interior led is dimmable and he starts by saying the car isnt attractive when i and pretty much every other reviewer think it looks great he didnt really talk to the steering or interior practicality maybe they think theres enough of that on other channels but then what value are they adding with this review and its inaccurate information not trying to be needlessly critical  and i happen to have test drove peugeot cars and concluded they looked nicer than they drive  but felt this was a poor review
2020-11-22,8J8pcx7GUr4,i believe that if you locked it using the key fob it wont unlock itself until you use the key fob again to manually unlock it 
2020-11-21,8J8pcx7GUr4,looking at the coments below i think you need to get your researchers to do more homework before you review a car
2020-11-21,8J8pcx7GUr4,can i ask you to show turning lights in all cars you review its really interests me what manufacturers have came up with
2020-11-21,8J8pcx7GUr4,nice height for leaning on  that is the decisive factor
2020-11-21,8J8pcx7GUr4,is there a frunk trunk in the front
2020-11-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,i picked mine up end of september new gt from peugeot edgware when i got into it in the collection room it showed 200miles range i now charge it at home on my wall charger and fully charged it usually reports 135miles it obviously has to do with the outside temperature which in st albans lately is very cold and that does impact the onboard estimated range i was told that in ideal conditions mild weather that figure will increase
2020-11-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,could do with a v8
2020-11-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,i like this car its a shame it doesnt do 250 miles maybe one day there will be a cheap 250mile car for sale
2020-11-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,what is in the big ugly  dangerous bonnet
2020-11-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,not to concerned about the range as it seems average for the price of the car and fits most peoples needs and got me an ev for an affordable price and my fuel and servicing savings pays for the car  i had a bwm 4 series before and was expensive to run and this cars quality and interior finish and performance is just as good and i am very concerned about climate change and beside ev cars are better to drive a bit boxy though lol
2020-11-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,"i think everything is ok with this car except 50kwh 50kwh is really not a lot for an suv it should have 75kwh or more
this is the massive downside when sharing a combustion engine based plattform
this is what vw does absolutely right
 they have a pure ev plattform
 they offer three different battery sizes and this gives them a huge advantage because in the sales statistic they see what people really buy and not just claim to would buy
with thee different battery options vw exactly knows from their sales statistics if they need to increase battery sizes or not listening to customers what battery size they really want by looking into the sales figures is the smartest thing that they can do
peugeot can not do this with offering one battery size which is stupid"
2020-11-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,love another great fully charged review but can we replace the google word with ecosia please and plant some more free trees 
2020-11-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,you review cars from the stand point view of a country side person some of us are city people this car as way enough range for us you seem to be a big fan of tesla who in my humble opinion makes some of the worst assembling and quality interiors cars in the market a car is way more then a electric battery with high range sorry to disagree on what seems to be your view of what is a car by the way peugeot is today way closer to premium quality ps whats with the  it doesnt have a reverse camera  comment  that not accurate comment seems like a very anti french brands bias to me do you know any brand who would not offer that option today
2020-11-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,the other quirky thing in modern cars is the indicator storks that nobody uses
2020-11-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,id drive an electric car except id look more masculine wearing a dress
2020-11-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,i cant get over how much the style of this vehicle looks like my nissan kicks
2020-11-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,thanks for honest review better to know upfront range and charging speed is king
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,no back camera are u kidding
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,"so when robert got it it would not only do 100 miles or less on a full charge it only showed that was what it would do
if he had gone up to the top of a long hill and gone down and the car showed 5 on the fantasy meter then he could have had it show 229 miles range then gone up a motorway and got only 135 miles"
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,"so you unplug it at 100 or 98 and the range showing is from the last figure you were getting so the car was just at 30 or 31  there is a trip meter   read the owners manual or just turn the left hand stalk and look through the options in front of your eyes
  strange the range some people say they can get at motorway speeds with the bigger psa models all using the same platforms especially the taller  heavier ones ton bigger wheels  tyres than say the ecorsa which is the lightest and lowest     are many owners driving alone with no luggage  the tyres over inflated"
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,really like the front seats in the new peugeot cars
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,a lot of mistakes robert and the range a central point of the review as you said 130miles are from the last driver that is why it is taking a long time to update the range if you could not figure out how to get the trip odometer or dimming the ambiance lights you should read the manual or contact peugeot not put it a review
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,"peace mercy and blessings of god be upon you i am an islamic preacher my name is ahmed i invite you to his servants the one god the one for him the king of the heavens and the earth and you believe in his messenger ourmaster muhammad and you read the book of god the noble quran whoever repents and returns to god cultivated this world 
and its end and escaped the 
torment of god i hope that whoever reads my comment will act upon it"
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,800 is it because the previous reviewer was driving it like a twat and now the software is trying to recalculate what normal looks like
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,and as always please show the boot with seats down thank you
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,the grill  why have such a big ugly one on an ev  the styling is entirely uninspired
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,yeah another massively overpriced underperforming electric car  i started to get the impression that old manufacturers are taking all of us for a ride  until now the only car that makes sense in terms of price is dacia spring under 20k only that renault doesnt want to bring it in uk after brexit will be probably 20 more expensive
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,"peugeot wanted to make a car that looks like an everyday ice car the big brands need time for the transition so what better then taking these two facts and say lets build a car that we can sell a ice and also as electric if you look at it from the business perspectie its a good choice many people dont want to stand out tht their car screams i am electric from far this kind of car is for them  just like the new opelvauxhall corsa yes the range is a bummer but other then that i dont see issues  with this car 
also saying its a transition car is a bit weird cos normally you would call the hybrid cars the transition cars
just sayingé"
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,i wish that someone would make an electric volkswagen beetle equivalent small cheaper simple goes from a to b i dont need to do twitter or email while im driving or 0 to 60 in 3 seconds  i just need a simple inexpensive small electric car theres a reason why beetles lasted for 70 years
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,130 milesfail
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,a few months ago i went for a test drive in one of these quite liked it but the dealership showed zero interest in actually wanting to sell one to me and it was like pulling teeth to get any numbers out of the guy even if it were just a ballpark figure soni could work out deposits and budgets put me off the car got an mg zs ev as my local mg dealership had an amazing offer on them not sorry at all
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,i like the old peugeot shapes and wonder about the retrofitting market to deliver a better ev solution i like your comment about traditional car makers placing the ev models at the top of ranges when they would be better as a forked range i think it cause designers are too much in love with luxury differentiations as opposed to workman functionality  vws peoples car 20 which as in china would really drive ev deployment watching the long way up on apple  and the software tinkering rapid iteration of rivian and harley davidson its a good example of what your saying western producers
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,nedc stands for not even darn close lol
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,it  uuuugly
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,im lostif its range is so poor in reality how is it rated at circa 45 kilowatt for efficiencysurely that number would be alot worse
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,reverse cameranot sure i actually watch the screen when reversing rather mirrors and actually turn my head lol 
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,dont deride fantasy scifi  for obvious reasons
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,had a look on the new zealand peugeot website seems they are not interested in selling this model to us but thats typical as our government is crap when it comes to pushing evs so our car market is all about ice still goes to show that they are all still not interested in selling the world evs if they are not pushed by goverments to do so
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,i enjoy all the videos i understand if ive got it right the 2008 is the vehicle that peugeot are making the mokka e from the mokka e that you could only look at and pushed boundaries by touching the bonnet  yet the 2008 is with you for driving  also the gt line diesel had reversing camera that had graphics memory so you reversed over the filmed image meaning what you see at the side of your door was something that was filmed passing the boot lid which might sound a bit french as they say 
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,errr trip is on the button on the right hand stalk  keep pressing for different options
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,hmm lets make an ev efficient whoa brilliant make it have a drag coefficient like a barn door with ginourmous wheels  compare it with slick evs instead of droning about fossil dinosaurs o
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,rtfm for gods sake you have quirks not the car 
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,great honest review 
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,i just looked up my local source london charger  7p per minute or 420 per hour for 7kw thats something like 30 something mpge just a  rip off if think ionity can even beat that at 79p a kw
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,as to realworld range i dont get it why do these manufacturers always have to lie wltp is a lie only epa is quite honest
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,"just a tip i believe the conversion from whmile to whkm is not correct
and perhaps you could add a high pass filter on the microphone audio for those of us listening with a hifi set with a subwoofer

love your content please keep it up "
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,"everyone you cant say  politely that a car is a piece of shit
 robert hold my beer"
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,epa has mpg equivalent numbers for city and highway cycles i always liked those for comparisons of ev vs ev as well as the reason that it demonstrates the huge efficiency difference between ice and evs in general
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,the e2008 gt line does indeed have a reversing camera as standard i have one myself
2020-11-22,8J8pcx7GUr4,maybe he kept looking in the wrong place for the image like through the back window for instance
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,also will you make a video on the recent 10point green plan by boris which includes bringing ice car ban forward by 5y and what that means for the ev infrastructure which is quite poor compared to some european countries etc
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,good looking car not like that bmw abomination i will be in the market for an electric car next year and so far im between tesla m3 and this one the rest are just either meh or overpriced for what they are im looking at you vauxhall
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,miles per gallon is directly related to the cost of electricity if i charge at home on overnight 447p kwh i get 240mpge if i charge in tesla superchargers at 24p kw i get 60mpge if i charge off shell at 39p kw i get 39 mpge most public charge points are very expensive
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,the bonnet is so high must be very bad for the drag coefficient
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,its not the designers and engineers that are stuck in the past its the managment that dont have the vision we would like
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,i agree 200 miles winter at 15c is all that its needed however that translate to over 300 miles advertised range
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,"mpge does not take into account the motor energy conversion wich varies a lot 25 to 45 energy convertion efficiency for ice
in the physics world running at 65mph require the same power the nature if the thing does not care what is pushing it
but electric can regen kinetic energy that an ice car cannot
so 130 mpge is in reality around 1303  43 mpg at the pump
this is really good figure  that a good ice car can do
electric car manufacturers are forced to have this good because of low energy density of actual batteries"
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,keeping instavolt evesham retail park in business i work on the retail park but rarely use it because its too close to home
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,"1312  and also except a reversing camera i cant get my head around how a car can be the top of the line and not have that camera

thanks for the conversion effort at 440 just wanted to point out that you should divide by 1609 instead of multiplying"
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,its a shame that the more radical bmw i3 and jaguar ipace feel like the moment when companies and their designersengineers saw the future and made something fresh nothing much has come close since as they all become more conservative and transitionala consequence of the need for more mainstream adoption
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,i loved the citigo but there were too few and i didnt get to get one had enough kit and plenty range was cheap as borsch
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,why have a grille i just dont get it
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,i would love to see companies to come up with simple cheap electric cars without any flashy features like autoclose doors heated seats autonomous driving stuff like that
2020-11-22,8J8pcx7GUr4,dacia spring fits the bill there
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,they really should test all electric vehicles by charging them drive directly to a test track and drive it at top speed untill it stops then give us that range its not how most people will drive but that number will be lower and show that most people will get better range
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,my theory with electric ones being the higher models is one of market people buying cheap cars live in flats or houses without driveways and garages  they cant charge an electric car and the public infrastructure while improving simply isnt there  sadly we are still slightly at the point in the uk where the ability to charge an electric car is a luxury especially one like this that would have managed maybe 2 days of my commute if i was a bit lucky  so either you spend an hour in a tesco car park 3 times a week or you buy a petrol the trim level is not the determining factor here  once this improves and it will do in both range and charging provision then boggo spec electrics will be vital  now i dont think theyd sell
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,i love my e2008 driven carefully i get 42 miles per kwh aggressively  31 my range at 10 celcius is between 189 and 140 miles annoying things about the car the only way to see battery percentage whilst driving is via the phone app fuse box takes up half the glove compartment on right hand drive versions door cills too high and voice recognition appalling i have no regrets its super refined practical and efficient ive driven many of the e2008s competitors and the peugeot is my favourite there is no heated steering wheel they do a very basic version rear view camera available ambient lighting adjustable trip computer easily accessed
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,i love the fangs
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,nice car shame about the review for the third car review in a row we have a car which according to the review takes more energy 466 whkm to go 1 km than to go 1 mile 290 whkm a mile is 1609344 km so a shorter distance uses more energy than the longer one whats wrong with this picture
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,was disappointed with his attitude to this car ive watched this channel for a a long time the car has been designed with ev in mind clearly its built on same line as ice vehicles and the same underpinnings as e208 corsa and that nasty  green mokka he looked at and loved a few wks back  you cant expect car makers to jump 100 immediately to electric the trip resetview is on the stalk the led lights can be adjusted or switched off car does come with a reverse camera to my knowledge the range is fine for now psa are not tesla and are in a transition themselves he was unfortunately wrong about the spec levelsgot totally confused with that i felt he had pitty on the car in the end by saying he will drive it a few days more as though he had his nose turned up to it and that it was something like tesco value goods maybe he has something against peugeots non wacky evs or sub 4 secs vehicles life isnt crazy and extreme all the time rob im disappointed with his attitude in this video yes i have this car on order and other reviewers love it and the e208 i find his attitude very strange on this video together with the information provided
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,"surly 290 watts into 1kw or 1000 watts  345 miles per kwh or am i missing something 
the other point i would make is to quote mpg is a bit of a red herring it all depends or how and where you charge for example home charge peak 14p per kwh off peak on octopusenergy5p per kwh rapid charge point 35p per kwh ionity rapid charge 79p per kwh its cheaper if one can home charge but a huge number of people cant and they will have to use public charge points which are much more expensive this is where infrastructure has to be improve in a big way and these 7kwh points should only charge households rates of 14 pence per kwh"
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,all evs should made from ground up so it a what i class as a 100 electric car range i normally charge once a week anyway so would still do it if i have a bigger range the 80miles from the i3 so range is not important for me it would be a bonus if i had more range just incase i need to go further
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,"very nice looking car just hope they do 3008 out as i had one of these years ago and loved it do it as electric and i would have one and the i3 would go
good review and keep up the good work"
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,438 again with the stupid obvious mistakes 290whmile but 466whkm even though a mile is longer than a km
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,love the equivalent of mpg in order to educate the doubters inspired 
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,nedc testcycle is dated wltp is a good guess round about 10 to optimistic with most cars
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,its the mg estate for me suvs are like bums everybodys got one
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,"it boggles the mind that most modern trains are using dieselelectric traction yet a car like this is not certified for towing talk about a missed opportunity

2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,a bit salty today arent you robert love ya 
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,i was at a lunch with an ex peugot manager the other week he said psa dont like electric and are only doing on sufference
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,seems like peugeot have jumped on the tesla bandwagon l think we need some clarity on where wlpt  epa figures come from if they are going to retain any kind of credibility i appreciate its hard efficiency varies so much in an ev depending on conditions but please can we have some honesty here kudos to hyundaikia l understand they asked epa to down rate their range so customers wouldnt be misled
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,please sort out the conversion errors
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,i havent even watched the video yet but robert im concerned from the thumbnail that youre clearly leaning on the car as it drives down the highway at speed id recommend against that as it could be dangerous
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,"evs do not need a hood
make some shorter cars come on you can do it

no towing  that is just silly its not allowed to"
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,calling a car the 2020 2008 is a very odd marketing decision
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,this is typical of what we will see from the legacy carmakers until they are no longer allowed to make ice vehicles it does the job and will appeal to ice car buyers except for the range but is deliberately not a replacement for an ice car

2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,some of the designed as electric cars look dreadful the id3 is a classic case in point tech for tech sake and lots of software issues get petrol people to like electric is what the mini electric peugeot e208  e2008 does no need to be weirdly designed and plain ugly
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,i am not really sure this is a car review
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,well although it will never see the light of day in australia doesnt sound like we are missing out on much either
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,28k not bad i was expecting more for all the extras
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,i beg to differ the toyota prius is the most efficient car the prius prime is the over all best car
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,i love how robert is casually leaning against the moving car on the tile 
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,thx for pointing out that there have to be more cars with low trimmings
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,i dont think that the peugeot e 2008 has a heated steering wheel option on any trim level but ill be happy to be corrected if wrong
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,robert if the car is a bit shit dont be afraid to say its a bit shit
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,it sounds as if they are letting the side down if they dont measure the battery soc accurately and give the range you should be able to get by driving normally that is supposed to be one of benefits of leccy over dino juice sloshing around in a tank
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,that thumbnail tho
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,200 mile or 320km range would be plenty for most of us and i live in brizzie and that would be for the occasional trip to either coast or up the range im sick of suvs and alike why do people buy them ill stop the winge now
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,looks very bulky on the front end whats the drag coefficient please
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"i have the ds3 etense with the same battery and motor and am disgusted at the real world range of 120 miles at 70mph and 175 at 55 mph and remember you cant drive 120 miles then charge up because you need a good 15 miles of driving round to find a working charger so not even 90 minutes of driving inbetween charging and thats in summer i have done 12k miles and am now giving the car back and going for a new diesel 2008 as its a motability car disgusted
you can reset the trip computer by pressing in the right stick till you see trip 1 or 2 then holding the button in for 3 seconds to reset the mileage
dont have it in b mode regen and floor it pop it in sport mode then you get the full power"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i think if you are reviewing a car you should take the time to research the car first so you can actually talk about it in confidence i have been a patreon supporter i wont go into details as to why i am no longer a patreon supporter but this video is partly the reason most of it was you saying how bad this car is and things you dont like about it the gom is particularly bad until it gets to know you i have owned a tesla model s i now own this cars smaller cousin the e208  it is an incredible car by far the nicest looking ev in my opinion and  the 2008 is a close second  please do take the time to learn the cars features before you make grandiose statements that are factually incorrect it just undermines the credibility of fully charged as a channel looking forward to that time and then i can support fully charged once more it has been for me for the last 5 years one of the best ev channels out there lets keep it that way
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,having a special button to ignore programmed charge times feels slightly unnecessary i presume the car like most modern cars as builtin navigation which means the car _should_ be able to see that its not at home and it should ignore the charge schedule as a result
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,nice but the mustang mach e had it beat with looks so far the mustang is the best looking car
2021-06-22,8J8pcx7GUr4,no chance
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,my parents had an e208 and they had a horrible experience
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,just a thought  it sounds like it has the same battery as the e208corsa eds it is bigger so it will not be as economical as any of these
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,from my test drive it can do 180 miles but you would never know it from the gom
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,290 whr per mile is the same as 345 miles per kwh not 445
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,dull what was in the frunk any space
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,how do the manufacturers get away with advertising these range figures that are not accirate wouldnt be allowed in other industries 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,the gom in this car is bizarre  when you switch drive modes it never changes also the delayed acceleration is annoying
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,not good enough  get a tesla folks
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,even my kia soul ev 2016 has a reverse camera  pretty good one too
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i want to see whats under the bonnet 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i love love love the way that car looks  wayyyy better then my box on wheels kia soul ev  but my cybertruck will be a giant triangle on wheels so my opinion is different than most
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,yeah but your still a peugeot driver if you buy this car
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"personally not a good looking front grill publicity says it looks like a lion i think it looks more like a morse
i personally prefer the the plain looks of the  id3 and you get more mileage"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,no reversing camera in a premium car is a major fault
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"the mpge calculation is wrong if you use 290whmi to get to mpge you divide 1000 by 290 that gets you your mikwh which is 349 not 45 then you take 349 and multiply it by the kwh equivalence of energy density in a gallon of gas which is 337kwhthat gets you a mpge of 116mpge thats not even close to your calculations of 187mpge my model 3 with me driving like a grandma is averaging 156mpge so for this small crossover to be getting better efficiency than a lighter sedan is a stretch

im sure someone just messed up a number or two but its definitely important to get the numbers right either way 116mpge is still amazing"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,theres something not right here my 70 plate e2008 gt line no extras has both reversing camera and sidedown cameras which are excellent also does circa 185 miles no problem so had bobby been given a duff model to review agree re range computer had a mind of its own kia have this down to a tee
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,so its the top spec 2008 with 180mile range and no reversing camera hmm oh and you cant tow oh ok
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,dinosaur reviewer
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,im going to the ebike expo this weekend in auckland if im lucky ill find someone to convince you that it is worth coming to nz with your next live show
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,bob can stand faster than i can run 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,having driven one of these i can say its one of the quietest cars ive ever been in very refined that familiarity to traditional cars works for a lot of people who dont want a wacky novel experience from their car they dont offer base spec trims because a they dont sell well for any car  most people buy mid or top level trims anyway b how do you justify the cost of a base spec ev which is many thousands more expensive than the equivalent combustion car you dont you offer what people expect at that price point
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,rob you need to use this platform to start calling out people like julia hartleybrewer on talk radio she has peddled on her show for the last 2 morning to an audience of millions that electric cars are worse for the environment than ice vehicles disinformation is in full swing love the video by the way
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,everybody will have their own opinion but my first impression this vehicle is not attractive at all it looks like there is a giant v8 combustion engine under the massive front end ugly but the competition is always welcome
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,as an e208 owner best car i have ever owned by a street i am a bit surprised by the quibbles you raise in this video noone uses nedc range peugeot themselves stress wltp and in my e208 it is clearly accurate i have driven 200 miles on one charge more than once ok it was during the summer the e2008 is only slightly less economical by all accounts and in recent tests both variants have exceeded the wltp figure ignore the gom  the software is too pessimistic and a software update is out there to fix it i dont see any link to the fossil fuel mentality though the bonnet on an e208 is smaller it is true agree it needs a reversing camera my gt has one surely there is a good argument for introducing an ev option into the range to make it seem less of a leap to drivers not fully signed up to the ev revolution the id3 is a great car  but the egolf seems to appeal more to many drivers because they are used to the way it looks
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,yes it sure is a nice car but despite that i would not drive it for the simple reason because they also make a petrol version of it that really is a bummer in these times you should make a statement that you drive an ev and not an ice car renault is doing a better job with the zoe
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,dacia announced an electric car this car will be cheap below 20k and probably wont have as many shiny features therefore it will just be a pragmatic car to get you from a to b
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,peculiar software quirks  of course its a peugeot french
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,surely the legacy auto maker to watch is vw
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"as you say if the driver had a trip meter you could do a rough mental calculation and come up with an estimated miles remaining then you could compare this with the cars calculation of miles remaining then would probably be significantly different to the embarrassment of the car manufacturer
but there is no solution to this dilemma the miles remaining on any particular amount of charge varies greatly and it depends on how you drive heavy throttle or light throttle will make a large difference to the miles remaining
how can the manufacturer predict how you will drive in the future cant be done"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,if the range number is near 250 then those are kilometres
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,google peugeot trip meter first result even has a picture
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,brilliant honest report as ever apart from one thing  it is fugly
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,bjorn nyland provided data at the end of his video the 2008 did 610 miles on 154kwhs thats 39 miles per kwh he chose mid priced chargers preferring to save money over expediency but at 35pence per kwh this translates into a total cost of 5390 to travel 610 miles thats 9p a mile the range wasnt actually established as he arrived at chargers with 10 and charged up to different levels to optimise his get away and to avoid the delay in charging above 80 financial and efficiency stats are secondary to the environmental benefits though
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,like the mpg equivalent along with the kilowatt hour
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i used to like this channel a lot it even helped me decide getting an electric car however this particular presenter is getting gradually more and more annoying theres no structure to the reviews they are hugely inconsistent and most of all i no longet feel they are trustworthy just like some militant vegans  going on and on the whole blah blah about electric sounds like a madman talk this militant approach will not help convince people not trolling but im just sad that the channel with such great beginning which i was planning to become patreon of is now going downhill like that i have driven a lot of cars too and this peugeot is some of the best available right now imho this review unfortunately doesnt do the car justice if one calls himself a car journalist he should definitely do a bit or research because half of the things he says are simply incorrect
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,yea pleeez
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,its a no from me
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,45 kwh usable battery and car estimated 98 miles of range what have the previous test drivers been doing 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,ask bjorn nyland hell know exactly how much energy this car required to drive 1000km in fairly adverse conditions too
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,please fix the units conversion errors 290 whmi are 180 whkm not 466 whkm this is the third video in a row with this type of wrong units conversion
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,will it still only do 60 in the middle lane of the motorway
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,the important point in electric car is how producers clen  energy to charge the car
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"the conversion from a us gallon to electricity  337kwh
so taking the mileskwh x 337  mpge

in our egolf we have averaged 55 mileskwh so that is 185mpge
in our bolt ev we have been averaging 45 mileskwh  151mpge

290whmile  1000290  345 mileskwh  116mpge  in us gallons at least"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"love that colour wish my polestar was available in a similar paint also wish my polestar had an opening sunroof like this one
i think the car will appeal to plenty of folk perfect as a second car for doing the school run"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,290 whmi  180 whkm and not 466 whkm
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,why cant more ev cars tow
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i worry about french electrics especially when it gets to complicated electrics as on these types of vehicles i will wait for toyota or may be suzuki to bring out a full electric vehicle before buying
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,dont its a myth from the past which is no longer true most elecsbin peugeot are actually german made
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,add some night driving would be nice to see the interior light and more importantly the headlights at work good or not
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,if you buy the 12 petrol turbo with autobox which is sweet with a 500 mile range filled upwhy would you buy this
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i have been waiting so long for you guys to do a review on this car thank you very much no doubt its a lovely car but you are dead right its a transition car i would definitely wait for an updated version in a few years time to see what improvements have been made for distance and the inclusion of a reversing camera 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,there is a reversing camera this guy didnt even bother opening a booklet to see all options you can get a basic electric you can have a camera there are so many incorrect things he said in this review
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,forkemuffin good to know thanks for the reply probably best to test drive it myself before making any sort of conclusions after reading up on the car the gt line definitely has reverse camera not sure why he said what he said a lot of incorrect things in this review which is disappointing
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,i thing this reporter car petrol dont know this car
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,forkemuffin yes
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,how about a comparison between this and say the mg zs ev to show how a cheap ev suv compares
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,you need to take into account after sale network resale value 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"for the first time a deslike from me
about the range this was based on the driving style from previous drivers from other tests and from owners the range is good
i think is not an issue if the car was build for being compatible with a combustion engine as well"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,a on paper a zoe ze50 gives you much more value for for money than this
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i like the 2008 ev but i think the battery is to smallit needs more range
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,im with robert on the upspeccing of evs i tried to spec a skoda enyaq up to the level of my humble mg zs ev with sunroof and intelligent driver aids it added 8k to the base price which didnt even include keyless entry
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,not the best look fiddling around the front of your trousers to activate the key specially an ole codger like yourself lol

2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"no fault of roberts but these mid size front wheel drive suvs based are becoming really samy

was musing today zoe ze50 powertrain in a kangoo or caddy sized van how exciting would that be"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"3008 is the one to wait for 

some focus issues here with this production"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"i am more venal than robert i tend to calculate the financial mpg equivalent  which is more relevant for me 
at 35 mpkwh and a 8p cost per kwh and a gallon price of 5 ish its over 225 mpge "
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"the reason why this cars are always top notch trimm option is because theyre still a niche market for more heavy wallets 
the presenter has a point why dont we see base of the market electric cars 
ill answer because they are still too expensive for the average buyer

the typical buyer is top middle class owns his house not flat and can compromise their life style 

im a big fan of electric cars butstill too expensive and not suitable for me explanation made above"
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,"toxicbatosss do you really believe that it sounds to me a little bit of propaganda coming from all ev manufacturers 
the point is traditional car makers have to put lots of money into rd now making then bleed in their financial reports  cue loss into mainstream media
in essence they are losing money mainly because this is still a niche marketto make a profit they need to start selling in the millionsbut you wont because its a niche still"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,again the wrong conversion from whmile to whkm every heard of learning from ones mistakes cmon guys
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i cant believe that they dont have a reversing camera younger drivers in new zealand will struggle with this fact
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,there is a reversing camera maybe not in his test car but its available
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"i have this car and regularly did around 200 miles during the summer around the city

we did a long trip to somerset from london and averaged around 60mph and got 155 miles of range 

in winter so far were getting around 185 range 

its our first ev and we really like it its a lease and now that weve had it well be getting something with 200 

if all you do is mostly city driving then youll easily get above 180 miles of range across the year 

ignore roberts crappy review car"
2022-03-26,8J8pcx7GUr4,i think also teslabjörn got quite good efficiency so either car was faulty in this test or something wrong in testreview
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,you missed the 1 major problem with peugeot which is the glove box they are too lazy to move the fuse box with the steering wheel so the glove box is pointless i ordered an e208 which we were expecting on the 20th thats only a few days away and they still havent even made it so i expect a lengthy delay but our dealer hasnt been any good and we tend to have to do the chasing for updates
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,looks and appears to be an electric car they had to do to be credible rather than want to do  shame
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,they only offer that level of trim to justify the inflated prices
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,the government needs to rethink the subsidy available to private buyers company car drivers get 0 bik every year of ownership private buyers get a one off  3k  grant
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,it would be nice to see whats under the bonnet
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,get my gt e2008 on the 30th of november already ayer hearing you im really worried about the range but i have a friend in sweden thats running a 208e and hes getting 320km normal driving so hopefully mines going to be better than 150
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,dont worry range drops a lot when you pick and drive 140kmh or more and car adjusts the calculation he picked a car and had a review without even bothering to investigate property you made a great choice its a fantastic car and the range is good
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,forkemuffin thank you very much for your reply its greatly appreciated ill let you know how i get on in future thank you again
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,pathetic range due to too small battery  low efficiency the new mg estate looks like a much better bet if you are looking for this size of car
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,veggies want a sausage to look like a sausage and taste like a sausage but without the meat i want an electric car to look like a car and not be snobby about electricity
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,another tank on the road necessitating other cars be built like tanks  if that thing hit you youd know about it 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,other than vw hyundai  porsche the only reason to get a non tesla ev so far is i like that brand
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,love robert but the rant about the different specs is bizarely wrong petrol or electric you get the same options of specs so why rant about the fact you have been given a high spec one to test drive of course you are always given a car with everything loaded on it they want you to like it you can fine low spec models that are cheaper its strange you would pretend otherwise
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,also it does over 150 miles easily in the winter its almost like you made it out to be a bad car not sure why all these strange trumpian facts to follow the narrative its a transition car its a perfectly useable and one of the best on the market for the money
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,my gt line came with a reversing camera and lane assist as standard also when fully charged my range is showing 185 miles although i am probably getting 140 in reality
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"great to see a car i helped design on the road
the car is made on the same line as the petrol and diesel models there are definitely compromises to this but the advantage is that you can flex from 0 of the cars being produced being electric up to 95 as an example of this we expected to start at 25 being electric but its currently running at 145 and thats on psas highest volume line"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,440 slight math mistake 290 whmile is not 466 whkm 466 whkm would be horrible if true if 290 whmile is true then it should be 181 whkm
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,ok got it peugeot bad chinese mg the best car ever yeah right
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,sadly peugeot has zero support where im from and its asian counterparts are much better quality so its gonna be a miss for me quite a shame though cuz i quite like the way it looks
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,if my renault kangoo ze had a 100 kw battery instead of its 33kw and held 200 winter range here in gloucestershire for back lane drives you open it up by taking the panel out behind the drivers seat i would keep it for more than its current 10k instead of wanting to upgrade to a cyber truck as soon as love the channelthanks
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,you touch your thing and the car unlocks wow
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"no it was not adapted it was built from the start to be either petrol diesel or electric psa has the opposite view of vag on evs on that matter
the wltp range is the same for every ev theres been tests on the e2008 that show 300km 200 miles lets be honest too much talking as well"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i know it isnt available in the uk but the new twingo ze is pretty bare bones the base level zen doesnt have all the bells and whistles and here in italy can be bought for about 11k i think you said you now have a dutch presenter and they have them there so it might be nice to get a review yes it is still agnostic not a ground up ev but i think youll like it nonetheless
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,in the past 10 years the nose of cars and trucks have been getting fatter and fatter why is that is it some kind of modern aesthetics  coz it doesnt add to it aerodynamics
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,so many of these not very appealing slow uneconomic midrange evs are basically 30k making the model 3 at 40k seem like a good deal hoping prices push down but until tesla reduce the model 3 to 35k or less or come out with a model 2 why would they 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,please check your efficiency figures at 4m39s   290 whmile 466whkm  it uses more energy to go less distance  290whmile is a touch over 25 mileskwh  
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,kwh and range so a good ev will use 1 kwh to go 34 miles petrol and diesel have about 910 kwh of chemical energy per litre which in a fuel efficient car may do 10 miles or as low as 5 miles the latest landrover defender does petrol 20 miles to the gallon 5 miles to the litre12 mile to the kwh the reason is simple most of that chemical energy is wasted as heat and friction and air resistance about 80 where as only 20 of an electrical energy is wasted in things like friction and air resistance
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"its just a bigger e208 same battery size same motor same interior features      
the only difference  less range and more expensive not a great deal imo       
with incentives the e208 is not bad with less range range but a better charging speed than the zoe 1000 optional dc plug the e2008 however  its on the price range of the korean ev suvs and it loses the game here"

for example i am waiting for a an electric saloon car such as the 508 that doesnt look like a kitchen appliancespaceship"
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,the pricetag for is not transitioning however thats a shame
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,"honestly making a transition car in any case is a bad move evs are interesting because they are not bound to the internals of ice so interior shapes and exterior shapes can be drastically different which makes them feel interesting and new from a new ev i at least expect 500 km range and 150kw charging so far only a small portion of evs managed this

many evs made in 2020 were there mainly for regulations lets face it otherwise they would have waited a year with way more range and charge speeds this includes id3 4 and also the 208 and 2008 especially horrible evs like the hondae and mazda mx30 show that these are just statement cars not actually viable cars made for everyday use"

2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,150 to 200 miles range may be enough in englandits not even close to enough where i live even during the summer let alone winter just a trip down to see my daughter and her husband is 240 miles one waywith hardly any ev chargers worth using bunch of old 50kw useless ones along the way i would really need an ev with say 400 miles of range in the dead of winter to completely replace any ice vehicles i ownhopefully that day isnt too far away

2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"i like the channel but i am disappointed in the recent reviews the range calculation is wrong no mention of benefits of 100kw charging and cmon you can just ask anyone who drives peugeot they will tell you where the trip meter is 

in my opinion this car is in between zoe and id3 pure yes it has less range but the faster charging will allow you to travel at similar speed or even faster during longer trips"

2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"i think youre incorrect when you say you can see and hate the way this car was clearly designed to have petrol and diesel engines and electric only as effectively an afterthought

it has clearly been stated by the psa group that these new models 208 2008 c4 corsa etc were designed to be built on the same production line irrelevant of power train and manufacture doesnt need to change irrelevant of demand for petrol diesel or electric therefore if demand was towards 100 electric they would simply build them like that

for the costs of electric vehicles to come down to an acceptable and affordable level for the majority of users platforms and bodystyles will need to be shared plus there are still a lot of people that dont wish to shout about the fact theyre driving electric and wish to come across holier than thou as you are increasingly doing on your reviews"

2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,thanks for the video in the interest of fairness it should be said that 50 of the fuel cost in an ice car is tax so the equivalent mpgs need to be halved
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i love how every ev reviewer feels that they speak for 99 of people when they say 200 miles of range is plenty  i have over 300 miles of range and i can live with it but i would welcome 200 more in a heartbeat  i realize that i dont speak for 99 of people but i do commonly see others with the same opinion  i also realize there is currently a dimishing return on battery size so there is still a practical size limit  im sure as energy density increases over the years the average range will too  ill bet in 10 years 200 mi range will be considered tiny
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,it is based on statistics about how people use their cars it could well be that people who have to drive a lot like sales people care more about cars and therefore are more active on car centric social media
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"john as mentioned that 99 is all about statistics these cars are aimed at average users rather than the top 1

if we use usa data as it has higher average mileage than any other country so is basically the worse case scenario usa drivers do around 13500 miles per year on average or 260 miles a week thats  about 37 miles per day on average in the us assuming they drove 7 days a week so even if someone did 5 times us average each day that would still be under 200 miles a day and again this is the worse case country

other countries do much less mileage on average the uk for example does 7400 miles per year on average and has been gradually dropping for the last 30 years it used to be around 12000 a year germany is slightly higher than the uk at 7800  so that works out at about 22 miles per day on average for germany most other countries in europe do less mileage than germany japan is even less at under 6000 miles per year so under 17 miles per day on average less than half the us average

so when an ev reviewer says 200 miles is plenty for most people thats literally what they mean its plenty for most people in the world based on actual statistics

also bear in mind many of these cars are being produced by european and japanese companies for the european and japanese markets

there will always be outliers of course and even for an average user there will be days when the car isnt used and then other days when they do a longer than normal trip"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,theboothy666 i still dont think averages dont tell the whole story  if they did people would be happy to have 5 gallon gas tanks in their cars  maybe someday when there are level 2 chargers at every parking spot and dc fast chargers at every highway off ramp then batteries could be smaller  until then ill take as much range as they can practically squeeze into my car
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,johnh8268 do you charge at home if i did i could live with a very short range ev like a first gen leaf  it wouldnt be nice occasionally   a car with 150 miles though would make range an issue only on holidays and driving holidays are not that common for me   a car with a huge battery would be capital sitting around doing nothing  perhaps as much as the cost of redecorating the house which would give me more value
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,timmurphy5541 i have a nonstandard use case  i work in two different locations that are about 250 miles apart and travel between them weekly  i only have a home charger at one location  i rely on supercharging for travel between locations and while at the second location
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"johnh8268 i agree to an extent i think we do need many more fast chargers than we have now and personally id be uncomfortable with an ev with less than say real world 250 miles range minimum
but i think the 5 gallon tank is a little different with an ice you always have to go to a station to fill up which would be a pain if you needed to do that every day
with evs most people although not all of course  would charge them at home overnight and would only use 3rd party chargers if they were traveling beyond the cars range
with an ev  youve basically got a full tank every time you set off from home
 some people only have on street parking for example so an ev might not be good for them currently especially for a high mileage user"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,johnh8268 ah just noticed your post so seems youre basically one of the 1 i can see why a good charging network is important in your use case nice to see youre actually having a go with an ev even though you are definitely not an average user 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,johnh8268 so i think you benefit from a long range ev even if it costs more
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"the text with consumption figures in wh per mile or km are messed up at 440 it states 290 wh per mile and 466 wh per km but since a mile is longer than a kilometer this makes no sense i assume you accidentally did the conversion the wrong way round ie converted 290 miles to 466 km assuming the 290 wh per mile figure is correct it would translate to 180 wh per km which sounds about right this is the second time ive noticed this error in a fully charged ev review

anyway thanks for posting videos like this about the many new ev models that are appearing seems not so long ago that there were only a handful of options "
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"i so agree with you about range its the one things petrol heads embarrass  us ev fans with

and how long will it take to fill up  elon has most car makers over a barrel"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,sorry but this review lacks a lot of research i own this car and many of the complains in this review like the led and trip meter are easily fixed in the infotainment and the range thing have no idea how you can only get 130150 miles i easily get close to 200 this was a bad review i guess if it had been chinese fully charged would praise the heck out of it also funny that you say combustion cars are pointless yet you are leaning on one in the thumbnail that is a normal 2008
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,in basic terms it is a converted ice car or as they are called a compliance car where the car maker cant be bothered to do a fully ground up new bev car with good flat floor battery and good range and nice driving so being a compliance car best avoid buying it get a full bev car the range alone be far better in the fully bev

2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,yet another spoton review thank you
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,seems like one of the better budget evs havent compared the zoe leaf kona and this closely enough to determine what is the best but they all seem decent so its pretty much up to taste and needs i guess it is at a dissadvantage though as some of the competition is made as pure evs also the cheaper id3 models will probably stir things up altough people seem to like the pretend suvs
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"lets be honest here this suv screams compromise in term of battery efficiency and range the only great feat of the platform it is sitting on is the heat pump even tesla has to play catch up on that  now and the inverter that sustain 100kw dc charging speed it is a car that will be marketed for families and in todays ev world and the lack of 3rd party charging stations im sorry but i will not use this car to go on vacation or to visit relatives living 2hrs away
also regarding all the negative aspects that bobby is findinglike the rear camera absence on a high level trim the indoor led ambiance lights being actually dimmable  and are getting this comments section puzzled you gotta ask yourself what peugeot uk fail to present when they handed the car to him its not the first time psa is kinda not taking fc seriously almost as if theyre trolling"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,1120 what no frunk
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,stop having a  dig at combustion cars you wouldnt be where you are now if it wasnt for those cars 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,lets be clear  the whole of western civilisation wouldnt be where it is now without ice
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"the ice has immeasurably transformed billions of lives for the better over the last century 
so lets try and give it a bit  of respect shall we
its time is coming to an end  but boy would we be in a worse position without having had the benefits"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,bobby touches his thingy to open the door oo eer missis
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,but it works 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,hi robert  i can pick up an mg  exclusive at 22000 is this worth the extra money much appreciated thanks
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,that steering wheel looks very small and awkward
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,somehow i find his reviews boring
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,you know i think i come to this channel more often for robert than the electric cars these days
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,yeah well a car  metal box on wheels
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i agree i like the color
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,sounds to me that if you had this car in a canadian winter you could make it to the supermarket and back 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,lol
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,and it would catch fire if you try to charge it
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,by far the worst revue on this channel so full of errors you can do better sir
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,no point being petty and critical if  your not going to elucidate  thats just attention seeking
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,andymccabe6712 his mistakes were already pointed out in the comments no need to mention them again
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"took me 2 minutes to look up the 2008 manual pdf

2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"come on   you know kryters doesnt do sums or tech
give him a break"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,range and performance and lack of features makes this vehicle really awfully pathetic to say the least total crap tesla and or nio is much better than this garbage just drive it into a river
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,aptera 40kw battery 400 mile range 100kw battery 1000 mile range not legacy
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i do 120 miles on 20kwh in my e fiat for which i paid eur 7500 used french cars are as always financialy unviable
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"my citroen c3 picasso diesel isnt
its excellent in every respect  and much more practical and much cheaper to own than anything reviewed here
ok  i know its destroying the planet but"
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,andymccabe6712 french spare parts are diproportionately expensive not that my kangoo wasnt reliable but after a certain age when you start needing bits and pieces youll discover they cost at least 3 times as much as for other cars my neighbours had a picasso and he got 52 us mpg on holliday trips which is amazing in such a big car
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,the e208 is a little disappointing real world range wise really like it otherwise but the e 2008 with the bigger frontal area is bound to be even less efficient the zoe is built ground up as an ev but i still prefer the e 208 and i tend to think the end result is the most important thing rather than the design ethos i agree that price wise they seem to be overpriced best to wait and buy one a couple of years old i think
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,why you compere the peugeot e2008 with the tesla you can buy a peugeot e2008 40000 euro while to buy the cheapest tesla is over 112000 euro
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"i normally multiple kwh x 4 for my style of driving  if im driving like a petrol head i multiple kwh x 2  it doesnt work when you look at the heavier bricks out there

btw i love the override button when charging ive been caught out with my leaf 2020 plugin to 50kw charger no worries plug into 7kw and i need to force it thru the app"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,at the peugeot prelaunch event i said to the rep that all evs not just the top trim should have a reversing camera because pedestrians wont know they are about to move back every ev on sale today should have a cable storage area under the bonnet not a quaint handbag taking up luggage space
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,he said he usually stored the cable under the boot floor panel
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,do they come standard with pedestrian emergency stop front and back if so the camera would just be an extra nice thing to have but not absolutely necessary
2023-01-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,theres a great hidden storage area under the shelf in the boot
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,where is the intro to this video shot beautiful countryside
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i think something is wrong with your car i have a peugeot e2008 gt and when i charge it to full it gives me 312 km
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"they could make a peugeot e108
but they dont"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,they will eventually they just start for those cars that are best sellers around europe
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,aaronstarklinux its actually a lot more complicated than that the profit to be gained by selling electric cars in higher segments is about as much as the profit to be gained from selling cheaper electric cars the problem is that the investment required to get that profit is a lot bigger for cheaper cars so they purposely go for the the fat juicy sedans and suvs even though theyd make the same amount if they didnt
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,peugeots are generally made of plastic and disappointment not for me
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,my peugeot expert has been going for 21 years now  its great only one door handle broke due to being plastic
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,if the onboard computer has the ability to have different driver profiles if you create a new one then it will do all the driving calculations differently from a fresh start or at least it should if the programmers did their job because in the world of shared cars in a family who use different driver profiles the ability to check if the 20 year old son has been thrashing the car and ruining the economy statistics and so needs to be putting more towards the maintenance is quite essential otherwise the different driver profile option is pointless
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,nice  but why hold on to the grill  hey henry you want me to put a couple of saddles in that model t
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,the best thing with the the world going electric is the decline in caravans on the road
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,yes i agree no more caravans until i buy one 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,well  yes and no  many of these new electric cars look like a caravan with their weird designs
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,detaart the future always looks weird i should clarify that i meant to say caravaners
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,make evs affordable for the masses
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,turn the mood lighting down in the settings
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,a bit boxy for me if the front end was more aerodynamic might get a bit more range definitely need 200 mile range these days
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i dont suppose the automotive engineers with all their experience at peugeot thought of that then making it more aerodynamic
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,totally agree with the mpg bit we should always covert to mpg to show the efficiency of evs also and importantly when comparing the co2 emissions we should always include electricity used for refining petrol if people include the generation of electricity when looking at evs co2 emissions then the same should be done for petrol and diesel
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,best looking ev in its segment in my view
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"437 why oh why oh why do you guys keep getting the conversions wrong

290 whmi should be 180 whkm pretty decent efficiency or alternatively you have the units switched and its really 290whkm and 466 whmi pretty awful efficiency"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i suspect it done specifically to irritate people like er
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i think he left his mathcircuits at the set of red dwarf
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,i was just about to make a comment about this and saw this robert you need to fix this
2020-11-21,8J8pcx7GUr4,mdashikuzzaman i was also going to point out this  and they did this mistake at least 3 times recently not only in this episode 
2020-11-24,8J8pcx7GUr4,or how about just forget the silly imperial units and stick with metric if people cant understand metric units they can put into a conversion program eventually they will learn to use metric
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i dont care what you say 150 miles range is enough owns and drives a 200 plus mile tesla if you are a 1 car family the longer the range the better we do not have a reliable enough rapid charger infrastructure to validate such commentary also faster charge rates require more cells in parallel the current physical limitations can not be dreamed away you want a small battery ev by an electric motorcycle its time to put up or  leave it be i own one they are a lot of fun to ride make sure to do so safely and dress for the slide not the ride
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,it depends doesnt it im in a one car family and 150 miles range would suit me perfectly if i had a driveway to charge on i dont commute to work so my mileage is not very high  im really more concerned by having enough space inside and initial purchase price
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,hi robert just wanted to point out youve got the trim level logic backwards batteries are still expensive therefore having evs only on high trim levels gives them a larger margin to absorb that cost the tech you get on a high trim level isnt worth 10 grand its almost all margin the seat mii electric which starts from 19k used to be around 10k when it had a petrol option
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,how can manufacturers justify 9000 for the battery
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,recumbentrocks2929 thats a question for them to answer since i dont have any inside knowledge of the costs incurred or their margin for warranty repairs etc looking across the industry evs are roughly 710k more than a base model petrol version also there were reports that the electric miiupcitigo triplets were being priced at a 5k loss in order to mitigate eu fines
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"at least they got it right  put the charge port in the rear

charge ports in the front make no sense"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i have been waiting for this review for a while remember the e208 from fully charged live 2019  loved the design the seat comfort was on the firm side this year my parents were looking for there next car they wanted a petrol powered jeep compass i took them to peugeot as it was the only electric suv available on the motability scheme other than the mg made sure they tried the petrol first then the electric  as soon as we got back to the dealership from the test drive they were sold on the e2008 the seats are much more comfortable than the e208 with enough room in the rear for tall adults and enough space for a wheelchair they are also offering a free polar membership for a while with a home charger as far as i know when my parents went to make the factory order at the dealership motability took the car off the list that day they didnt give us a real reason why  just usual grumble nonsense  3 weeks later they put the car back on the list and my parents have ordered there first ev they ordered the e2008 in gt spec handover is expected early next year exciting times hope to make it to the next fully charged live whenever it happens
2022-09-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,this really confirmed my comfort experience with the seats i have just ordered one and the seats were one of features for me
2023-01-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,claireasher4487  me too weve just told her on hope it comes soon
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"robert your maths skills are a little off 
290 wh per mile  344 miles per kwh"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,peugeot ice cars have dodgy electrics as it is so doubt a full electric will be any better as for trip computer you can adjust the dials in front to show all time or just push button on top wiper stalk till get up what you want see
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,love roberts 3 points of contact reviews feel like he does real world reviews rather than a petrol head journalist showing off as far as the car goes the front end looks too long and i guess that is part of the legacy of combustion engines under the hood the range is disappointing 200 miles should be the minimum by now and no reversing camera are they really serious because the mg zs competition is about to eat their lunch
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,the range is more like 140180 it just has a horrendously pessimistic gom some people are reporting that its better after a software update
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,the claimed 290wh per mile and 45kwh of accessible battery gives a range of 155 miles that agrees with your estimate roberts maths was wrong near the beginning of the video
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,rwbhere so 250km range sounds pretty perfect for life in the suburbs
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,great comments good electric option but waiting for a real disruptive ev from psa in a teslas way of thinking starting with a white paper  no one will buy a second hand petrol o diesel 2008 in five years
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,but are the wheels round
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,great review bobbyllew but i have to say its a very ugly beast it wont be on my shopping list
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i wonder if legacy manufacturers will for many years struggle to sell an eup size ev with anything like a decent range and still make a profit  the chinese are making some amazing small paired back proper city evs but for some reason i dont think that will be the norm  i think an id2  polo sized car will be as small as they will go
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,28k although for some reason it seems to be more like 32k on the peugeot website for the base 35k for the gt line  compared to 20590 for the petrol one dont think theyll be selling many of these on cost alone youve really got to want to have the electric one knowing your break even point is going to be beyond 50000 miles away also i think its a pretty dirty trick to make the electric one appear cheaper per month by whacking on a 10k extra deposit over the petrol ones to get the monthly payments to look sensible
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,1750 are you talking about the new 500 e
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,maybe in the future it will cost less
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,evesham my home town big up the vale
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"back to suv again its baffling how  unimaginative established automakers have become xd
anyway like i was sayin shrimp is the fruit of the sea you can barbecue it boil it broil it bake it saute it deys uh shrimpkabobs shrimp creole shrimp gumbo pan fried deep fried stirfried theres pineapple shrimp lemon shrimp coconut shrimp pepper shrimp shrimp soup shrimp stew shrimp salad shrimp and potatoes shrimp burger shrimp sandwich that thats about it bubba forest gump"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,same range reports with all psa ecmp based platform cars so far its just not very efficient at high speeds at all and when you add ice aerodynamics to the mix that just tops if off
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,a 2020 bev with 2016 specification rather poor similar vehicles hyundai kona and kia niro blow it away in terms of spec fundamentals
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,do you not think the ev market in the uk is going to be shafted with rishi sunaks plan for road pricing  could be 150 per mile
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,150 would be in westminster i guess less than 10p most places
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,not if you have to pay it for all cars not just evs
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,cant see a cost per mile happening anytime soon more likely a tax at public chargers and a large increase on road tax will be a more practical starting point
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,im so glad you are doing the comparison between petrolelectric in terms of mpgs its generally too difficult to asses the scale of economy without this data bravo fully charged
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,the competition is coming lol
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,why the huge front for electric cars whats the point of this wasted space make it smaller and easier for drivers
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,its the same car as the petroldiesel version thats why is still has a huge front
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,so first if we take the consumption and translate that to mpg it is massively more efficient than a combustion engine car then you get 130 miles instead of 260 miles from the car so effectively you simply actually dont get that very efficient car you blabbed about ca a minute before halving the range im not sure what i should take away from that blabla really 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,no its still efficient you need to look up what the word efficient means its basically like the battery has a gallon of petrol equivalent of energy but gets very high mpg
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,timscott3027 depends very very much on whether that mpg equivalent was taken from its official numbers or actual numbers now doesnt it im aware that generally an electric motor is more efficient than a combustion one mr impolite mcteachy but the text of this video went really really crazy with throwing around numbers halving others later on and being unclear on whats what about the first statement if you dont see that i guess you dont see that
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,fryke yeah i get you what you mean sorry for being rude still more efficient than ice
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"soo it uses 466 wh per kilometer and 1 mile is 16 km that means it uses 16x466wh per mile  7456 whmile
also known as 290 whmile  this kind of math has been in several videos plz get it right
otherwise  love your show "
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,the trip computer is pretty easy to find if you check the handbook just press the button on the right stalk
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,agreed rtfm   most of the niggles are configurable led lighting colour and brightness
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,it is weird that they do not make basic ecars  maybe they are getting rid of all the parts first before going to start making basic cars bring in the chinese ones and gee up the legacy makers
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,they need to justify the massive price hike somehow and sell their toxic diesels
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,timscott3027 yes because there cheaper when they close all the engine plants redundancy cost are going to be high
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,clacton17 yeah probably kind of tough shit though you know life sucks sometimes people have to move on and get a different job
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,compact suv are a total abomination all the problems of suv without the benefits
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,our gt line e2008 came with a reversing camera as standard
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,hey great video but you spelt battery wrong at around the 809 minute mark same on recent videos too 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"i own this car the inside led can be dimmed or turned off if it bothers you mine dont bother me 
over 800 miles i have an average 40 miles per kwh i have heater on auto and get over 160 to 180 miles at this time of year im a careful driver and expect much more miles in summer like i used to with my older leaf i had
i also have a reverse camera"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i dont think ive ever been in a car where the interior switch lights mood lighting or infomedia screen cant be dimmed
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,4 miles per kwh that sounds not plausible this is only about 150wh per km the most efficient smaller ev use that on the other hand i wonder how much interior heating affects that rating ifaik there is no heat pump in this car
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,your maths is a bit out martin 4miles per kwh is 250whmile so sounds very plausible and with 45kwh battery that would be 180miles of range
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i have had this model se line since july  during the summer i was averaging in excess of 6mkwh but now we are in colder weather plus i am doing shorter journeys i am getting just under 4mkwh  i plan on 160mile range during cold weather  shorter journeys using sport mode will decrease this but this is down to driving style
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,so pretty much what bjorn nyland got on his range test 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,martingorbush2944 watch bjorn nyland drive a 2008 over 1000km at speed limits 10 and achieve 396 miles per kwh
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,nice im tempted does it have auto hold for the electric handbrake
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,callumjimp yes my old leaf was the weird clutch style lol this has a nice auto switch easy access 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,nice to hear your getting a decide range too i get my black gt e2008 on 30th of november cant wait
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i test drove the car for an hour and was very impressed but they would not let me have one for a weekend as i wanted to do a 150 mile out and return 300mile round trip to see what the motorway range really stacked up to without that i just couldnt pull the trigger on it
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,awesomeactiontv6964 you will love it 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,mimbultonia i know the feeling i wanted to test drive others longer too but no joy i decided to take a chance on this and its more than enough for what i needed ive done various tests over my 800 miles and i judge how well itll do based on the quarter electric gauge basically i usually get 20 to 30 miles per half quarter so i then usually know how itll end up and im usually spot on when i 1st picked it up it said i had 188 miles i drove 15 miles carefully and when i got home it said i still had 188 miles lol
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,tomynysmon hes correct look again he said 150 wh _per kilometre_ not per mile
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,"martingorbush2944 
my kona electric regularly give me near to 5 miles per kwh of local road driving in the summer and 4 miles per kwh on motorways at 70 mph"
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,martingorbush2944 4 miles per kwh seems to be the industry target for any good bev
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,ujkakevin this sounds promising ive had my e2008 gt for 2 weeks not rans it below an indicated 40 mile range remaijjng but that would have only put me at 120130 mile in total hope to get more to be honest but i have free charging at work as well as home charging 
2020-11-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,martingorbush2944 their is a heat pump and check out the driver manual number 4 on the car diagram
2020-11-22,8J8pcx7GUr4,callumjimp i test drove it and i can confirm that it does have it i actually love that function too i am planning to buy one soon
2020-11-22,8J8pcx7GUr4,mimbultonia just watch the many youtube videos and you can decide
2020-11-22,8J8pcx7GUr4,danielcristea3868 i feel like i have watched them all just want to decide for myself if the range was just a bit further it would be perfect
2020-11-23,8J8pcx7GUr4,mimbultonia james batchelor formerly of carbuyer has got one on test and hes saying hes getting close to 200 miles following a software update  which i suspect has come in since robert filmed this video
2020-11-25,8J8pcx7GUr4,martingorbush2944 my i3 sits on 146 kwh100 km over its 70k km lifetime
2021-01-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,awesomeactiontv6964 any updates at all if you have used it for circa 2 months i have been offered an e2008 gt for work just mulling it over and would appreciate a hands on bit of feedback many thanks
2021-01-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,craigwilliams6049 got the car beginning of nov and i absolutely lov it the only thing id say is if you are going to have to do lots of miles when its cold temperatures then your going to watch the range ive notice and i have a friend in sweden that runs a 208e that youll loose 30 range once it drops below 2
2021-01-23,8J8pcx7GUr4,are the interior led strips also in the back
2021-01-23,8J8pcx7GUr4,no 
2021-01-23,8J8pcx7GUr4,spacedoutet do u like the car i can get the car in march
2021-01-23,8J8pcx7GUr4,krokobll love it so far so good i placed order in march and picked up october been reliable so far with no issues touch wood thats all i needed was reliability fed up with vauxhall always caused me issues for years needed a change and if it runs as well as it has these last months ill be very happy 
2021-01-23,8J8pcx7GUr4,spacedoutet coincidence because im driving an opelvauxhall corsa right now lol do you use the app for your car
2021-01-23,8J8pcx7GUr4,krokobll lol i got the app but waiting for it to register to fully make use 
2021-01-24,8J8pcx7GUr4,spacedoutet do the car get updates
2021-01-24,8J8pcx7GUr4,krokobll i believe so but i think i have to do it a certain way unless im wrong lol i been a bit busy doing other stuff i have not had much time to look into it i keep forgetting everytime im doing something else  im a nightmare lol just aswell its running fine the guy at peugeot was nice throughout and said any issues just ring him but aint needed to 
2021-07-13,8J8pcx7GUr4,i would really like one but the range worries me especially in the winter
2021-07-13,8J8pcx7GUr4,thesaltybager totally understand im now getting constant 467 and just over 200miles so im happy with this i was a little worried id never achieve this but now have seen i can its a relief lol id say judging from my ownership from last october its probably 150miles in winter worst case 
2021-07-13,8J8pcx7GUr4,spacedoutet what sort of speed do you drive at to achieve that and do you drive on motorways much 
2021-07-13,8J8pcx7GUr4,thesaltybager im generally mixed but id say mainly lower 5060 im yet to do a solid motorway journey only because of the past year covid  not really had chance but its mainly my area driving so it covers perfect for what i need obviously everyones different and has different needs so its completely understandable your concerned i was the same as i was only offered a little test drive in a city and you always want a real test for what you do wherever your from i took a chance after owning a 30kwh leaf for 2 years and getting fed up with charging every 70 miles this doubled my range and i feel so much happier now tbh even doing a long journey most of the time in my old diesel i would stop half way anyway to eat or rest so having the option to charge doesnt really bother me whilst im doing that  what ever you decide im sure you will make the right decision for you 
2021-07-13,8J8pcx7GUr4,spacedoutet cheers appreciate the advice
2022-03-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i have this ev same spec gt line also did not come with reversing camera  supposed to be included on gt line but was missed on production line get about 120 miles on full charge in winter and about 150160 in summer
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i think even city cars need 150 miles range in winter driving after that it is just nice to have   the weight of the battery is the same full or empty so there is a point where the huge battery becomes an efficiency drag along with much longer charger wait times  i get the feeling car manufacturers and the general non ev public are still stuck in the petrol station mentality where you only charge  fill up   once  twice a month so the battery needs to replicate that   in reality a charger needs to be where the car is parked up for a length of time  so you graze charge not gorge charge
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i suppose it depends if you live in a flat my first ev was renault zoe 22kwh i quickly learned i didnt need to charge all the time even with a winter range of 70 miles  i topped up at home and warmed the car before leaving
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,peugeot and electric im sure that will be really reliable
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,my 2 have not skipped a beat
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,robert tells it like it is a road test thats actually useful instead of just an ego trip fab
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i know i love his review hes so open and honest about the fallacy of oems its a delight to watch
2023-01-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,except he got a lot of the information  wrong
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i thought you didnt care about looks at all but still find this lame 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,10k quid upsell over a diesel lmao thatdve paid off after 20 years of ownership oh wait the battery will end up in a landfill long time before that
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,fyi  440  conversion from whmile to whkm was accidentally multiplied by 1609 instead of divided by would be good to see a table of comparison to other evs of similar class and generation also is this manufacturers claims or actual result of testing
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,gt line  is the production line where they are thrown together faster     if they discard all the gimmicks bells and whistles they could be sold for less my current fossil car has an fmdab radiocd player fitted i turned it on when i bought the thing to see if it worked and it hasnt been turned on since  dont need or use it i prefer the silence so i can hear what is going on around outside   why do you keep measuring boottrunk space in litres i dont carry loose liquids in the back measure length width height in feet and inches or if you really must  in those foreign centimetre things range needs a bit more a place i go to regularly is a 210 mile round trip  in good weather  and there is nowhere there to charge up while im away from the vehicle so id be adding at least half an hour to the travel time  if big if i can find a charger that works  so i can get home again   and that big ugly square front so inefficient yuk
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i like your new video editing style who ever is doing it keep up the good work
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,peugeot cars are trash 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,why do car manufacturers still design cars like a damn high ankle shoe this exact one looks like an agressive high ankle basketball shoe freaking ugly as hell
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,all the same must be time for fully charged top 10 evs 2020
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,cant tow they need to make basic cars that farmers boat owners builders need at a reasonable price
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,well you shouldnt be looking at budget subcompact hatchespretend suvs then lol
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"im glad you mentioned the bit about the energy conversion into the mpg cause i dont think its talked about enough 

more people would switch to electric cars if they knew how much better it is"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"roberts ev review formula notes
1  tell them the colour 
2  tell them that its nice to drive 
3  tell them that the declared range is a bit of a fudge 
4  tell them random things as they occur to me 
5  share hope for a bare bones affordable electric car for the future 
i love roberts reviews and i will watch them all"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,it looks like you have watched them all already
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,karow92 and i will do again 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,sprinkle a bit ouf a rant against fossil fuel companies and legacy autos dragging their feet as well and you get the bobby formula love it
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"afterburner94 the rant vids are their own thing  i think the formula is something like
express frustration at the intransigence wilful ignorance and lies of a corporatepolitical power that is in favour of the shortsighted selfenriching nationally harmful energy status quo briefly lapse into a guilt laden class hatred toff voice swing wildly at boris and stumble blindly into a swamp of communism walk backwards through the globalist agenda until the cognitive dissonance dies down and hes back on the firm footing of it would be nice if everything were like it is on startrek 
i love these too and i will watch them all"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,6 what its like to lean on
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"sonicdeathmonkey12 i really liked that one fork 28k to have a good lean on it  
sport car  seems to be rubbish "
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"i like the look of the exterior and interior of the car and the price is pretty reasonable which is unusual for evs

sadly that is about it  it is a large suv a style of car i detest because the vast majority of this type of car are bought by people who really do not need it  the range is mediocre  the boot space is poor  the lack of reversing camera is hilariously penny pinching"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,they have to style it like an suv because you sit the body on the battery tray
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i like the scrap heap challenge music
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4," its a peugeot e2008
 i didnt know they were making ev way back then
 no its awe forget it
i like that rob didnt like it how annoying it would be if every can he tested was amazing"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,what is under the hood where you were resting your hand it looks big enough to take a weekend case on the outside
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,another suv 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,whats weight difference over e208 as that does 185 miles repeated ccs charging on car tested here and a light foot might do 145 miles better off with mg zs instead
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,or an mg 5 although id forgotten for an instant that mg is chinese not british interesting how the mg brochure has an mgc gt in the showroom alongside the new car
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,robert sorry to be the one to break it to you but your maths is failing you 290wh per mile  345mpkwh  i believe that miles per kwh is the best comparison as its most directly comparable to mpg and the kwh size of your battery your fuel tank lets you know the probable range  and low and behold when you multiple 345  45 you get 15525 miles just what the evdb says  other than that another good review
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"yes evdb says 250km 155 miles the nedc new european driving cycle gives a range of 267 miles thats 172 of evdb and apparently based on the rosiest of rosy scenarios

even the manufacturers site says the range is 206 miles which is still 130 of what you should actually expect"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,theres a comment just above yours from someone who owns this saying the get 160180 miles this time of the year with heater on
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"_rafiki first id like to point out that heater on auto does not mean the heat is on just that its enabled and will come on based on cabin temperature

second its usually not that difficult to do better than published range if youre a carefulmindful driver my 2020 kona ev is rated 258 miles and i can eek out 280ish with the heat blasting and it doesnt even have a heat pump just resistance heat without heating 100 range is somewhere north of 300 miles

the problem here is peugeot claims 206 miles which is extremely generous even compared to the 160180 miles that a careful driver gets it deserves a raised eyebrow of incredulity"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,hi smidge204 thanks for clarifying this 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,my thought exactly this is why i stopped to comment obviously as the rest of us he did not divided 1000 at 290 but rather made some math tricks and messed something  my trick was that 290 is almost 300 so multiplied by 3 will be almost 900 though the result is 3 plus something there is no need for a full second to think that  so when he finished his two seconds aaaaboooouut and said four i knew that down here somebody already complained about his math skills 
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,correct
2020-11-20,8J8pcx7GUr4,_rafiki expect if you drive around town in eco mode can get close to the official figures the norwegian fellow was driving at high speeds 75mph on the motorways and his tests showed 198 kmh or 124 miles so what to expect from a 216 mile range vehicle at motorway speeds assume on d and eco and down hill your would put some charge back into the battery
2021-01-10,8J8pcx7GUr4,so its a 45l tank 9l per 100k thats what i use in aust is 389 kilometers the best this car will do is 180200miles so 320 kilometers at best so how is it massively more efficient have i missed something
2021-01-10,8J8pcx7GUr4,tomlf8hx i am not quite sure what you compute but it looks like you talk about range i think that you missed that efficiency is about how much energy you put in for distance and for efficiency there is need to cut losses in friction at gas cars since gas was cheap this aspect was minor but for evs even electrons are even cheaper because storage is not so efficient as that in gas hence range problems efficiency in friction losses was important plus that known low efficiency of burning the gas in engine
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,it is the range estimater that is the problem not the range itself  it is very conservative and way out the range is as advertised or more realistically as you can find on the ev database i get about 220 to 250 km in winter 510 degrees and wet in norway
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,yeah theres still 15 miles easily left in it when its empty
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,where in norway do you live i live not 40 minutes from oslo we do have two months a year with 5  to 23 degrees that is the only range that matters my old renault zoe the 2nd model went from 340km high temp summer to like 180km in the hardest winter with a 40kw battery and super conservative driving  that is almost 50 range loss in the hardest winter months wich is way way too much  i even had it parked in a closed garage all year round
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,tsenngu west coast bergen it will of course get colder but winter is defined by constant mild horrible stormy weather i am interested to see though how it goes when it gets below 0
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,on the efficiency of petrol engines the ice component of the current mercedes f1 engine is the most efficient in the world and that achieves a little over 50 thermal efficiency the amount of energy going in that is translated to work on their project one road car which will have an engine derived from the f1 car they hope to get just over 40 when some of the most talented engineers in the world can barely crack 50 on an icu while any bog standard ev can easily top 80 efficiency and the good ones are well into the 90s theres no question the direction the world is going in
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"290wh per mile works out as 1000290  344 miles per kw i think so not 45 and i agree you should publish this 

and with a 45kw battery 45  344 is approx 155 range which i see agrees with ev databases figure"
2021-12-11,8J8pcx7GUr4,the conversion is also terrible 466wkm would mean it does 13 miles per kw
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,that is the gt model not the gt line
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,it is very weird that car does not have a reversing camera that is a standard feature from the second class up i thought i have gt line and it has a reversing camera maybe it is a uk thing
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i have a reversing camera that i never use i use mirrors and my eyes with support from my sensors to tell me when to stop so much easier and safer
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"it should have one gt line and above in the uk

i have heard of a couple of cars being delivered without them by accident though"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,finally been waiting for this for months too late tho already picked one up
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,are you happy with it
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,pixiiger yes overall very good got it using the bik tax free system and it was somehow very reasonbly priced went for the gt so have a reversing camera ect much better than a petrol dont agree with his statment about the range im getting more than him
2020-11-24,8J8pcx7GUr4,hamzabq1in i think almost everyone has said theyre getting more than him lol
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,yep thats so french nice looking with some annoying quirks
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i have a feeling fully charged got stock in cars i know fully charged is a lot about evs but its getting boring with all this car episodes dont get me wrong i love fully charged but it is so much more than cars cars cars   keep up the awsome work robert 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,perceptive we couldnt film any cars for several months then we got them all at once equally we cant film indoors in lots of places at the moment so episodes arent coming out in the order we would ordinarily like thanks dan
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,fullychargedshow ok everything has its explanation thank you for the answer  
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,it has a trip meter but it is buried as you say you have access it through your personal controls on the 3d dash and then press the button on the knob to your right you can have up to 2 trip meters at once
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i put it to you all those who say that cars arent getting more and more cookie cutter that you probably couldnt look at blacked out silhouettes of several different makes of compact suv and crossover and be able to tell which is which quickly and accurately  also youre not being picky about that interior light its a safety hazard  glad to hear someone else recognizes that a simple example of an car with no frills and just the basic features that youd expect on a base model 1995 honda civic with 200 miles of range in the winter would sell faster than they could fill out the order form
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,you thinking abilities are good but no average consumer will buy a car without decent features these days
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,have you looked at the side profiles of 2000s saxos 106s and fiestas cars within the same class looking similar is not a new thing its more or less how its been for a very long time
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,aljowen im well aware  just look at most of the pickup trucks from the mid 90s  mid 2000s  most of the sedans for the last 60 years too
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,good presentation
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,you can tone down the mood lighting personally i like them bright though 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,no one mention the 6 to 8 kwh of energy it takes to refine a gallon of petrol i cant be more precise as obviously the oil companies dont really want us to think about it  so basically if you have a hyundai ev youd be about 40 miles down the road with just the energy needed to refine the petrol
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,you are forgetting one thing you get 20 times more energy out of gasoline than it takes making it you are literally pulling it out of the ground not so with electrons they have to manufactured at a loss so please stop that efficiency nonsense about evs they are 6 times less efficient than gasoline cars the reason er like the is that they emit less polutants but we cant drill for electricity so they will never be more energy efficient than with a combustion engine
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"tore_lund as i look out of my window at the large wind farm with megawatts of electricity literally being generated with no pollution at all i can still hear your mad ranting about petrol its over get over it 
you dont need to drill for electricity it comes down from the sun it moves in the wind aside the the poetry you are also really wrong evs do the equivalent of 140mpg if you measure kilowatt for kilowatt of fuel and as in many civilised parts of the world we use increasingly clean and not drilled for forms of electricity your oil analogies are also wrong and before you start ranting about the materials in wind farms and solar panels ill just say oil rigs pipelines refineries gas tanker trucks fuel stations and only then 30 mpg"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,tore_lund you clearly dont understand you physics you cant make energy you arent making petrol you are digging it up and refining it once its all gone good luck making more 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,tore_lund how wrong is it possible to be you can drill for electricity it is called geothermal energy that is why all the server farms running the cloud are on iceland as others have said the other sources hydro norway solar everywhere wind everywhere do not require drilling they are all powered by the sun which is good for the next five billion years
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,muppet keeper data about electrical energy consumption varies from rafinery to rafinery in my country i can access data from the biggest oil company there but these are from 2014 then i found that for 1000 liters they use about 1mwh to even 4mwh of electrical energy that mean it is from 1 to 4 kwh per liter and that translates to 4785  1514 kwh per us gallon
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i agree with that just one refinery uses as much electricity as a small city the size of coventry to sustain production factor that into a gallon of fuel and evs are even more efficient
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,edwyncorteen1527 you got it yes it just pisses me off when people say gasoline is an inefficient energy source bringing up the energy use for refining but completely disregarding the energy contained in the fuel itself renewables also contain free energy however the degree varies wildly depending on type the electric motor is highly efficient saying the whole energy path making your wheels pin on you ev is too is disregarding the obvious
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,muppetkeeper you are mixing up efficiency with environmental impact hydrocarbons are the highest concentrated energy ressource we know of hence the reason it has dominated a wind turbine is only 60 efficient in ideal conditions more like 20 average the rest of the wind energy is just wasted hydro is a lot better though
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,tore_lund youre absolutely correct about petrol energy density  thats why its been such a good convenient fuel for the last 100 years  the problem is that an ice in a car can only make use of between 20 and 35 of that energy  the remaining energy is just wasted  its very inefficient
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,benj5386 my objection was some claiming that evs overall are more efficient without regarding that electricity is much more energy demamnding to produce not that evs are not better but from a strictly physics perspective more energy is wasted getting the wheels to turn that energy might come from a wind turbine so virtually free and with very little footprint but the wind energy passing through the turbines blades is magnitudes greater than what is possible to recover however had we something else than batteries to store electrons and a natural process to harvest them things would look very different 100ah worth of colmb potential is only 02mg in electrons in orher words 18g of electrons is enough for a lifetime of driving an ev
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,tore_lund you are mixing up efficiency with the need for efficiency efficiency is only important if the fuel you are using is scarce and none renewable it doesnt matter if a wind turbine only takes 20 of the force from the wind the wind isnt going to run out wind turbines are designed to keep themselves safe and functional therefore the dont want the full force of the wind  hydro may be more efficient but the huge cost of building it doesnt make it economically efficient
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,tore_lund this is simply false renewables like solar pv  wind turbine even after considering energy to build the system is far more efficent than even gasoline without considering refining and drilling bevs simply consumes less energy and renewables methods of capturing energy is much more cleaner then add to the fact bevs have crazy good life span which should do 400000 miles which many fake studies are ignoring energy density of hydrocarbons is pointless it has no effect on efficiency sure wind turbines are only 60 efficient because they over generate in the wrong times thus they have to be braked when the grid can not consume the generation but you are wasting wind blowing not freaking fuel your entire argument is logicaly broken wasting the fuel is not the same as wasting wind blowing
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,tore_lund you sir are a con artist and scammer trying to spin technical terms into falsehoods
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,neojhun what learn physics before you you degress into insulting strangers on the internet who knows the difference between pears and apples
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,tore_lund sorry nothing you said had functional understanding of physics just throwing terms and numbers does not inform how the system works i actually went into the mechanism and reasoning of what happens thanks for the swiftboating
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,neojhun then efficiency is the wrong word to use fossil fuels also has been concentrated by time as each barrel represents 4 times its mass in broken down biomass in other words  this is energy from before humans existed and no renewable source can reach back in time to collect energy from the past like that you could ofcourse argue that this is a highly inefficient process too as biomass is only capable of capturing a fraction of a percent of the sun energy used but the energy supplied by the human effort to get it is much less
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,tore_lund wtf but the energy consumed is less from wind turbine or solar pv capture to spinning wheels is still multiple times higher ratio for electric supply chain while biomass fossil fuels has a much small ratio from capture to spinning wheels you are trying to argue the sheer nominal amount of energy is more which make no sense you can not consume that much energy in an ev again your argument is logically broken ratio vs sheer amount
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,neojhun a solar panel takes on average 4 years to give back the energy spent on its manufacture if we then presume a 25 years life it is capable of supplying four times more energy than it has consumed a barrel of oil takes 4 of its energy to become gasoline adding another 5 for infrastructure and gas stations and geopolitical tensions it is still massively more efficient than solar  energy efficiency of an ev is a pointless argument the point is that the energy used has less co2 emissions and the higher efficiency of an ev itself adds to that but still overall efficiency of energy into revolutions of tyres is worse than using oil nb ive just ordered another 10w polycrystaline panel for my dashboard for 20 quid for that money i could have bought 20l of gasoline containing 180kwh of which a car could deliver 36kwh in mechanical energy the 10w panel will produce 10w6hours36525 years 547kwh in ideal conditions on my lattitude however it has taken 100 kwh to make it mining refining crystal growing slicing and doping and finally encapsulation so per pound paid it will give around 10 times more energy however this panel is horisontal and behind a windshield so more like only 5 times that of gasoline so in total i will get like 20 more energy per pound paid if i deduct the 100kwh used on manufacture however the reason it is worth while is because my dc converter has only 60 efficiency at low load which typically happens with daytime driving where only the inverter coolant pump and ecu is powered that draws 260w from my main pack but adding my first 10w panel reduced the consumption by 24w so in reality solar is worth more and cheaper than wall outlet power in an ev ie an efficiency gain
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,tore_lund 4 years out of 25 years that maybe is a sign of the ratio wtf thats 4  5  is current human generation ontop of the energy required in biomass to create fuel sure if your argument is the 9 of human generation gains 91 more energy from burning it thats more efficient but you just ignored the entire point burning fuel
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,neojhun i did not ignore the point of not burning fuel but that is not the issue here we are discussing efficiency that means energy out  energy in nothing else
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,"tore_lund 
the best ice has an efficiency of around 40  when not idling  you lose the efficiency argument just by the fact that an ice wastes at least 60 of the energy

it appears that you are unable to assess information correctly and believe that petrol or diesel simply appears in a fuel tank by magic  no surveying drilling pumping transport of oil refining transport of fuel pumping into the fuel tank involved  then the raw material isnt renewable on any sensible timeframe and has a sideeffect of overheating our planet"
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,boggisthecat i presumed 20 ice efficiency which is lower than nedec specs for most cars personally my last car was 245 engine efficiency on paper but in real life my summer average was no better than 22 considering 2 gearbox losses so 20 is quite reasonable if cars had 40 efficient engines drivetrain theyd be almost twice as efficient as solar panels
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,"tore_lund 
ice typically fall around 10 to 13 overall efficiency  there are losses at every step in the processing of the fuel before the engine is involved  40 is a maximum engine efficiency not typical

battery ev is around 70 overall efficiency and rising  around 10 losses internal to the vehicle mostly conversion losses from ac to dc and back with the rest being generation losses  this is if using a non fossilfuel source  a poor coalfired power plant will only be about 55 efficient at producing electricity so your overall efficiency would drop to somewhere around 35 to 40 if using such a source

worstcase scenario gives battery ev at least three times the overall efficiency and this could range up to seven times"
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,kehlerames218 that is very nice but not what is discussed here
2020-11-19,8J8pcx7GUr4,boggisthecat a tesla model 3 is 72 efficient presuming whatever mix of parking and ac used in the epa test if you go over the numbers at 60 mph a model 3 uses 17kw to maintain speed measured from the socket but requires 14kw in mechanical power 3kw is lost however an engined car needs typically  only 12kw to maintain 60 mph because it weighs half as much and rolling resistance is still 3040 of losses at that speed and is burning 45 l gasoline per hour ie 4736kw in heat input so in numbers a tesla is slightly better than twice as fuel efficient than a regular car not 5 or more times more efficient as you claim
2021-01-29,8J8pcx7GUr4,cbflazaro no that is not what im doing here i agree that the engine itself has only 25 efficiency but gasoline is energy concentrated by nature so it contains 20 times more energy than it takes to pull it out of the ground and refine it that is why compared by how much human effort it takes is far less energy demanding than other energy surces you can argue that electricity is not even a resource it has to be manufactured which is much harder than liquid fuel made over millions of years just for the taking so overall efficiency for a gasoline powered car if you include the free energy content of oil is 200400 even when the engine itself is only 25  an electric car can on paper never exceed 100 efficiency with perfect motor battery and wheelbearings energy will always be lost on the way to the vehicle
2021-04-12,8J8pcx7GUr4,bdelphan a donkey oilpump lifts between 5 and 40l per stroke and it goes around what 10 times per minute so that is average one oil barrel per minute if it uses 9mwh per month as you say while it pumps 43 thousand barrels each barrel then uses 209kwh of electricity or around 1 of the energy content of that oil it has just pumped even if a tesla can go 58 miles on that amount of energy a car can go further from the 120l of gasoline you get out of that barrel so it is very efficient refining takes 5kwh energy not only electricity but also heat because the waste heat from distillation is used to pre heat the next batch of oil going into the refraction tower distribution and advertising and gas stations is another 58 losses so overall the oil industry produces more energy than it consumes this is the reason it has been king for a century because it contains free energy made by geology and that is something hard to beat at the bottomline however as oil reserves become more costly to extract and solar and wind is getting cheaper this balance is shifting but oil has had an obvious advantage by being concentrated energy just for the taking we want to get rid of oil but not because it is inefficient and we are transtioning to cleaner sources that are less efficient because we need to reduce emissions drastically but oil has always been the fuel with less effort per kwh at the wheels of vehicles
2021-04-12,8J8pcx7GUr4,bdelphan my counter argument is still right too 9000kwh is still 43 thousand barrels capable of propelling a gasoline car for 33 million miles or half that if were talking a big car only getting  32mpg so the fact that an electric motor is 4 times more efficient than a combustion engine is in itself remarkable but it is the whole chain of energy use vs return that has made gasoline the obvious choice if we are going to talk about electricity production it also  has its own set of connected losses and has not been concentrated to dig up over millions of years we like electric cars because they are 1 cheaper to drive i use half of what i spent on gasoline just paying list price  tax at home 2 they have fewer emissions and if you drive a lot it is not an insignificant reduction of your household emissions  to get an ev 3 you can make your own fuel legally if you got solar 4 maintennance is rudimentary and is mostly the easy diy stuff like brakes and wheelbearings and new viperblades so from that perspective it is the better vehicle but it requires more manproduced energy per mile  driven than a gasoline car that cheats by borrowing from nature
2021-08-06,8J8pcx7GUr4,tore_lund ice are not efficient in any way at all
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,you can select a reversing camera as an option when you buy the car
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,its really odd since he was in a gt line variant which is supposed to have that out of the box but perhaps it depends on the market
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,zarkoh yes have a standard uk model gt line spec delivered august 2020 has reversing camera
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,watchmrcontent youd think reviewers always get the top variants for testing 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,zarkoh they usually do get the highest spec cars and this being the gt line should have a reversing camera as standard not an option for that kind of money its a bit odd to me that it doesnt 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,apafej627 yeah its precisely why i wondered to begin with even the variant under gt line called allure comes with the reversing cam
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,its 2020 a reversing camera would be mandatory in every vehicle even the base model of the cheepest option i can purchase reversing camera kits for less the au40 im sure the manufacturers can get them for less than 5 as they all have screens already in their cars so i think the point is that its a very poor decision to not put one in and shows that they arent serious about making a modern car and are stuck in the past with old technology and old ways of thinking 
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"kurtpalmer3674 its not the manufacturers being stuck in the past its just marketing they need things to distinguish between trim levels and encourage punters to spend more money  
i agree that reversing cameras should probably mandatory nowadays given how compromised rear visibility is on modern cars"
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,camera might be broken

the peugeot e2008 certainly looks the part but how does it compare to the other compact suv electric cars on the market its beautifully made and easy to drive but for a car with a usable battery of 45kwh you might expect a better real world range than this offers the inside is comfortable and it has a decent boot but it lacks a reversing camera and has some quirky internal lights that look flashy but are a bit distracting the e2008 is a decent effort but in an increasingly crowded market for compact suvs does it do enough you tell us

2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,"as a peugeot salesman im confused as to the spec you have been given the allure does not have a camera but the gt line should have you dont have to go to gt to get a camera

looking at the model you have it is a gt line with options it has not got the alcantara interior but it does have the panoramic roof

real life range should be about 180 from personal experience in town but maybe a lot less on motorways also peugeot marketing has been using the wltp of 190200 not the nedc

the ambient lights colour can be changed and also lowered or turned off completely

there is a button on the end of the wiper stalk to show you your trips including mile per kwh 

love the vids and i would love to answer any questions you might have as someone who is actually dealing with these models on a daily basis its a shame that it just arrived and a peugeot rep didnt run through some of the controls and features with you things like the trip meter is something i would have shown you within the showroom let alone when you actually drive the car"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,1818joe thanks for that response joe and i cannot tell you the frustration level of knowing how to view the trip meter gggnnnn it is also part of the problem of not having the car for longer and also not doing enough research my fail but all that aside i genuinely loved the car
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,ive had this now for a month have had consistently  193miles on the range meter
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,our range has been averaging 170180 miles after about 1000 miles of normal not particularly careful driving including plenty of motorways
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,1818joe my thoughts entirely i have a 3008 gt line which i love but i have front and rear cameras front is an option and the focal sound system  i want the e3008 please
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,when they built the first cars and tanks they had reins because the horse mentality was so strong
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,robert have you forgotten about bmw i3 which was completely different vehicle by bmw and the chevrolet bolt
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,tucdh4df im impressed by that weve not come close to that yet what sort of driving and any tips to max the range
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,"400  290whmile is more like 345 mkwh which gives a range of only 155 miles if useable battery is 45kwh 
edit and you confirmed the calculated 155 mile range later in the video
thanks for the review "
2020-11-18,8J8pcx7GUr4,lean factor reallly
2020-12-10,8J8pcx7GUr4,i love fully charged and the channel has been a big support  in helping me buy my first ev however this is sloppy journalism as most of roberts complaints about the e2008 are just factually wrong as robert has now admitted he didnt do his research properly or bother to work out the controls on the car therefore this is a bit harsh on peugeot and i do feel fully charged need to correct or redo this video but accurately and fairly this time
2021-03-01,8J8pcx7GUr4,"hi bobby i think its worth reminding people watching on these reviews that the cars built on the same platforms as ice cars are always less efficient than native evs eg leaf teslas zoe and hence youre going to pay the same price for whats a manufacturers first attempt also which is more energyhungry and prolongs the manufacture of the combined iceev platforms as you could be paying for a fully sorted ev 

if sustainability and efficiency is the goal i think theres enough choice on the market now to push people towards the native evs over retrofit evs like this much like fully charged used to encourage people to simply buy bevs over hybrids and rangeextenders  from a long suffering ev and battery engineer"
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,weird that you got such rubbish range bjorn got 120 miles at 70 mph on the motorway and nearly 190 miles normal driving maybe youve got a duff one his also had the odometer displayed so it is there
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,isnt it just possbile that the previous reporter just constantly floored the car so it calculates the range on an average of the previous kms it has driven as he mentiones in the video
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,arnevanhove yes that would explain the low guessometer reading on the dash but robert went on to say that he had run it until empty charged it and it only covered 130 miles obviously this isnt a scientific test of the range all other reviewers seem to say 180 miles is easily acheivable
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,maybe if it had less bells and whistles itd go further
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,trip meter on all modern peugeot cars is displayed on the instrument panel when you press the button on the end of the wiper stalk
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,if its anything like my corsae you can only have the trip in the central screen in a sub menu which is crap and yes you press the stalk to set the trip
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,it can also be set up to be displayed on one of the personal dashboard layouts
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,its optional information and has to be chosen as part of either personal 1 or personal 2 dash view
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,i believe the mypeugot app also will show all the trips including the power consumption
2020-11-17,8J8pcx7GUr4,wojteksiudzinski trips  yes consumption  no french developers are very conservative and app has only fossil fuel support its a bummer when such a good car is darkened by software limitations several software tweaks in app and dashboard and it would be perfect

2020-11-25,0jbMBVsQPvc,really enjoying vickys reviews lately just something more honest about them also answers alot of the real life questions we need to know wen shopping for a car not all about drag races and 062 times

2020-11-24,0jbMBVsQPvc,i like your presentation skills vicky way above average on youtube 
2020-11-24,0jbMBVsQPvc,i enjoyed watching the video review one of my favourite small suvs
2020-11-24,0jbMBVsQPvc,it is a really nice car its only a shame that is expensive it has so lower real life range oh and that it is a peugeot with its real bad building quality and costumer service only people that couldnt afford better cars would buy a peugeot but now with this price tag not even that which comes for the best because if you cant buy it you wont regret it later
2020-12-05,0jbMBVsQPvc,yet peugeot 2008 tops power survey for reliability on last generation models and peugeot is frequently placed above more expensive brands across surveysyou listen too much to hearsay and not actual owner surveys  my p is awesomehearsay or fact

2020-11-24,0jbMBVsQPvc,another expensive electric shopping cart how can you actually go anywhere in these things without wasting hours charging the thing
2020-11-25,0jbMBVsQPvc,080 charge in 30 mins at a rapid charger with a worst case range of 120 miles  youd need to be doing a lot of miles on a regular basis to have to spend hours charging it  high power charging stations are popping up all the time  if range is too low then id3 or kia eniro are better  lots of options out there and taking a decent break every 23 hours of driving is probably a sensible thing to do
2020-12-08,0jbMBVsQPvc,slabologist not if you live in a flat or have no off street parking like about 50 of the population
2021-07-04,0jbMBVsQPvc,malph how far is your commute  if your only a 1015 mile round trip youd only need to charge once a week
2020-11-24,0jbMBVsQPvc,so many modern cars this included are an ergonomic nightmare surely this should now be reflected in euro ncap ratings
2020-11-24,0jbMBVsQPvc,its too expensive

2020-11-25,0jbMBVsQPvc,there are just a lot of variables after living with the car for a week or so you have a rough idea of what it can do for your style of driving the kind of roads you drive on and the current weather coldwet can eat 15 of your range

2024-05-16,tTm0hfmIUxo,its worth noting that the final units of the peugeot e2008 went on a runout sale of just 39990 however this was after i filmed this review for that price you have a very competitive and upmarket electric suv that id pick out of most evs at that price point but at its orginal sale price of 59990 i felt it was not providing the value that other evs offered at that price range additionally i wouldnt want to be an owner who bought one at the original price as their car just depreciated like a stone after that offer was announced  cameron
2024-06-10,tTm0hfmIUxo,olá cameron      gostei muito da sua apresentação    vc sabe informar a data em que ocorreu o lançamento do e2008 na austrália      vc sabe informar também em que mês e ano ele foi oferecido por us 39990     desde já lhe agradeço pela atenção  
2024-06-11,tTm0hfmIUxo,thank you looks like it was during the months of may and june where it was advertised for 39990 here in australia but looks like all stock at that price has dried up as the updated e2008 makes its way here soon
2024-06-13,tTm0hfmIUxo,productreviewcars     olá cameron     obrigado pela resposta    mas vc sabe informar a data mês e ano em que o e2008 foi lançado na austrália     aqui no brasil ele foi lançado em novembro de 2022
2024-06-10,tTm0hfmIUxo,olá amigo cameron 
2024-05-20,tTm0hfmIUxo,the cruise control stalk being hidden is surely troublesome but if you own a peugeot it will take you about 3 minutes to learn and after 2 or 3 rides its definitely not a problem since youll have it instinctively memorized i would say this is mostly a reviewers problem not a problem for anyone meaning to actually drive this car same thing with the small steering wheel and position of the gauge above it thanks for a very good review
2024-05-21,tTm0hfmIUxo,fair enough different for everyone  just sharing my opinion of course spent a bit of seat time in some peugeots and found these ergonomic issues to carry over tbh but thank you for watching
2024-05-16,tTm0hfmIUxo,host is one massive douche never seen a douche like that reviewing cars dude dress normally and try to talk normally
2024-05-11,tTm0hfmIUxo,"i dont agree with your view on peugeot motorsengines
they are pretty reliable the worst part of psa brands reliability  at least in europe concerns doors hinge quality specially in cars until 2015 after 8 years usage they will give you trouble 
the price tag in your market is bunkers"
2024-05-12,tTm0hfmIUxo,oh thats not my opinion its based off data from owners from our site productreviewcomau who review cars theyve bought and lived with not to say you cant get a reliable motor but there seems to be a general sentiment they can have some issues
2024-05-11,tTm0hfmIUxo,"maybe a disclaimer shouldve been added to this story guys peugeot australia inchcape actually discounted the price of this vehicle on monday 6th may 2024 by 25000aud making it 40000aud drive away and in 4 days they sold their entire 2024 stock they now have no stock until the facelifted e2008 arrives at the beginning of 2025 

this should be a massive wake up call for peugeot australia in the way they price their vehicles if they want to move metal then they need to price their vehicles accordingly this was a great example for them"
2024-05-11,tTm0hfmIUxo,absolutely after a few visits i think they view themselves as a luxury brand
2024-05-12,tTm0hfmIUxo,i was about to include this in the video but by the time i had this scheduled to publish the stock was all gone and i wanted to report on this car at the price it was originally selling for itll be very interesting to see how they price the new e2008 as a result
2024-05-11,tTm0hfmIUxo,funny how you are so irrelevant europe gets a new model and you obviously get a dumbed down electrified version of the old model this isnt the all new 2024 model
2024-05-11,tTm0hfmIUxo,i really get the shits up when an ev is front wheel drive smacks of cheap internal combustion packaging everyone knows rwd is superior in conditions outside of snow even then the instant torque control makes rwd fine in the snow   suede seats are the best  this is in the end a 40k car  how they think anyone would pick this over the model 3 for the same price is insane
2024-05-11,tTm0hfmIUxo,but most importend thing buying an ev isinever a teslano matter what
2024-05-11,tTm0hfmIUxo,because they dont care about you and the rest of the world gets a better version 
2024-05-12,tTm0hfmIUxo,fwd setups can work for some evs but i agree that for the most part its been proven that a rwd setup works best if the platform allows will be interesting to see what the next generation e2008 will bring in terms of driving dynamics and price
2024-05-15,tTm0hfmIUxo,its 40k now and we still chose a mg4 as it drove way better
2024-05-11,tTm0hfmIUxo,usba ports on a 2024 car is criminal
2024-05-11,tTm0hfmIUxo,my antique charging cable begs to differ however choice would be nice 
2024-05-12,tTm0hfmIUxo,its about to be updated so this was just a carryover from older 2008 models
2024-05-10,tTm0hfmIUxo,another excellent review from the best reviewer
2024-05-12,tTm0hfmIUxo,very kind words appreciate the support
2024-05-10,tTm0hfmIUxo,i totally appreciate your honesty and great reviews
2024-05-12,tTm0hfmIUxo,and appreciate you watching 
2024-07-27,cZHgS0GaCwc,good car for avakris tyson
2024-06-05,cZHgS0GaCwc,we just bought a 2023 demo version for 37k with just 4k on the clock it drives beautifully charges in just a couple of hours from a normal home powerpoint and feels comfortable and warm my wife loves it especially the small steering wheel daily communting costs have fallen from 7 to just 1
2024-05-04,cZHgS0GaCwc,just ordered one today for 38500 da with 5year service pack in vic its a nobrainer on a novated lease
2024-05-04,cZHgS0GaCwc,given that this vehicle is currently sub 42k driveaway even with a 50 kw battery and smaller range would your overall review on it change and if so how
2024-05-04,cZHgS0GaCwc,"great question i stumbled across the driveaway deal the other day  if you shop around you could be paying only 36k driveaway less in qld with the 6000 incentive 

its bloody unbelievable for that kinda money"
2024-05-04,cZHgS0GaCwc,therightcar are the dealers negotiating on this 39990 advertised driveaway price for 36k on the road in nsw i might have to take a closer look if i was in qld it would be a no brainer theres nothing else anywher near as nice for 30k
2024-05-02,cZHgS0GaCwc,at currently 26k off now makes much more sense
2024-05-03,cZHgS0GaCwc,"youd feel pretty bad if youd bought one for over 60k

the best alternative to this car is this car for 40k"
2024-05-04,cZHgS0GaCwc,haha thats why im here watching
2024-05-04,cZHgS0GaCwc,kdegraa you sure would be but good for who ever buys now
2024-05-04,cZHgS0GaCwc,bauboni ive been trying to figure out if i could live with the range  very tempting as in qld get another 6k off rebate
2024-05-04,cZHgS0GaCwc,"anthonywilsonmm8rn be quick mate that 6k discount is running out and this peugeut at this price wont last either
at 138kw100km as tested thats over 350km in range if you need to drive further regularly get a corolla cross"
2024-05-04,cZHgS0GaCwc,bauboni nah we are going to go for a longer ranger ev  this is our only car so need a minimum of 450klms we are in a regional area  if it was a second car we would absolutely go for it  we will wait for a e3008 or a kia ev5
2024-05-04,cZHgS0GaCwc,anthonywilsonmm8rn regional id get a toyotahyundaihonda hybrid too much hassle yeah was looking at this as a 2nd car our main car is a lovely cx8 they are going for massive discounts btw
2023-09-16,cZHgS0GaCwc,good to see some new ev options in our market peugeot to me is most of the time bit pricy without obvious reasons this e2008 is actually kind of reasonable to me
2023-09-17,cZHgS0GaCwc,cool  thanks for your thoughts
2023-09-12,cZHgS0GaCwc,"you can buy a 4x4 mux on road for that price  scary 
i havent been off road for ages but i know which one id rather drive 20km round to work each day
and which one id rather drive for a 300km round weekend away
balanced and informative review as always  
continued thanks matt 
therightcar"
2023-09-12,cZHgS0GaCwc,thanks again mate yep it isnt cheap
2024-05-03,cZHgS0GaCwc,therightcarit now is cheaper
2023-09-07,cZHgS0GaCwc,"compromised  ill wait
my tesla has unfortunately jumped the shark"
2023-09-07,cZHgS0GaCwc,ive never understood that saying
2023-09-07,cZHgS0GaCwc,therightcar its an american expression i understand  i certainly wouldnt trade mine in for the loss of driver controls the ps5 mob seem to think is cool
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,why did you test the old model the new one is already on sale
2023-09-07,cZHgS0GaCwc,because as i explain in the video we get the old model in australia we are well behind the current model rollout for a lot of products here in oz
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,"we have a mitsubishi outlander phev 2023  fantastic vehicle

we get 80 km of pure ev driving per full charge which is more than our daily driving  we havent used a drop of petrol since we first bought it it literally still has the full tank of petrol 53 litres sitting in it since we first bought it

i actually want to switch off the ev mode so i can use up the petrol so we arent carrying around 39 kg of useless weight"
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,why not just buy an ev
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,therightcar because i live in queenstown new zealand which is in the country  the charging network sucks  so i needed the back up of an onboard generator so a phev made perfect sense
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,"therightcari test drive a byd atto 3 but wasnt impressed  i loved the kia ev6 but its way more expensive than the mitsubishi by 20000

i wont buy a tesla even though i like them because elon is a twat"
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,"anyone buying this is asking for an enema later on

stay away from french cars period"
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,"being a current owner of the previous generation peugeot 2008 for 10 years ive always enjoyed sitting behind the steering wheel of peugeots early design of its icockpit layout ive never had an issue with it but will admit the smaller steering wheel did take some getting used to its been a great little practical crossover over the years ive always admired the second generation 2008 from a far but felt there were better options out there its the same case with the e2008 unfortunately i just dont get why peugeot wants to be a niche brand in australia and only offer expensive vehicles

on a side note our old peugeot 2008 active will be getting replaced with the new skoda karoq 110tsi style in a week or two which will then share garage space with our volkswagen polo 85tsi comfortline"
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,am not yet sold to hybrid or electric cars
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,"hybrids from toyota are pretty much bullet proof as its pretty much dumb technology standard a nickel metal hydrate battery pretty much is the lowest standard  for hybrid but its also one of the best in terms of how simple it is hence why toyota use it for their petrolhybrid based engines

now as for full bev only vehicles look if you have solar with battery backup then its fine as a metrourbancbd run about if you rely on grid power with no solar then your wasting your time yes its cheaper than a petrol powered vehicle but no where near as covenant and then you have to factor in external recharging which is not cheap at all in relative terms either"
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,i used to like peugeot vehicles and owned 2 many years ago the problem with an ev based on an ice vehicle is that it really isnt a purpose built ev and i do think the alternatives you suggest are better options without a doubt the mg4 is a purpose built ev as is the byd atto i agree with your views on the peugeot dashboard i like it and the car looks well finished if i wanted one id wait for the updated model
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,thanks greg
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,this has a great design but the fundamentals such as price value range and fast charging rates mark it as an also ran
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,you make a strong argument there
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,the ev concept has failed i believe that at this stage car manufacturers are just trying to push out the door all their products before the general public know about it
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,you are completely wrong
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,"absolutely especially here in aus consumers and manufacturers have realised the greenest solution are the hybrid offerings the purchase price is also an inhibiting factor in australia or any country for that matter that doesnt offer rebates or tax incentives

it will take around 10yrs of usage and feedback in the market before the issues really start appearing the shortfalls are already apparent in environmental impact battery longevity and replacement cost the insurance and crash repair costs battery safety and lack of battery recycling in australia are becoming apparent

i believe japans lack of interest in evs chinas enormous wastelands of sold but unused evs and vw groups incredible scale back of ev production are signs of the the failing ev segment 

evs were deployed by unscrupulous companies to make profit from the to be short lived ev market before its impending replacement with hydrogen"
2023-09-04,cZHgS0GaCwc,always wondered but with ice vehicles theres a lot of discussion on reliability eg toyota is pretty reliable jaguar isnt how is reliability measured for evs they no longer have all those parts anymore aside from stuff like cabin quality does this mean all electric vehicles are on the same reliability footing
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,its honestly something thats on my mind a lot too i find myself more confident in the reliability of these european brands when it comes to evs how thatll actually pan out in the long term i guess we can only wait and see
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,rexthesheep the only thing that separates an ev from an icev is the mechanical aspect of the driveline  that is the long block engine portion and the ratiochanging portion of the transmission everything else is  for arguments sak the same  so you remove that aspect and any reliablity issues associated with it and replace it with an electric motorinverter unitand a single speed transmission all things being equal youd expect the electric driveline to certainly be significantly more reliable mechanically but not infallible due to its simplicity but potentially a bit less reliable electrically due the complex and high power inverter that is absent in an ice  the net outcome i would say is a higher level of reliability overall for an ev    but still the same old situation for every other aspect of the car that causes people problems and frustrations and this will happen for as long as manufacturers cut corners in engineering both mechanically electrically and electromechanically  including material specification  and for as long as variations in quality control at the manufacturing level exist 
2023-09-06,cZHgS0GaCwc,"rexthesheepvery good question however the european brands are known for their electronic gremlins and failures so i dont understand why you would feel more comfortable with a euro brand

also based on your question if an ev could effectively last 1 million km with just minor mechanical parts replacement such as wheel bearings suspension pads etc and having its battery replaced every 200000km think thats being abit generous but for argument sake is that reliable

i mean the battery is a consumable at huge cost and what life expectancy and what if the manufacturer ceases to supportupdate the vehicles systems preventing its intended operation with updated infrastructure"
