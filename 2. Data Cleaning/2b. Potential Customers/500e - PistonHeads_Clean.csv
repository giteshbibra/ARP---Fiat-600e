2023-04-21,https://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&f=23&t=2031582&i=20,thats it in a nutshellfor as long as anyone can remember the xj was jaguar and that market is disappearing rightly or wronglyeven the a8 7er are really halo products these days theres little other point in making them the remaining market is the sclass because traditionso what could jaguar do no good merely copying the taycan because if people want one theyll buy the porsche traditionjaguar tried copying bmw and the same rule appliedits really hard to imagine quite what it would take not to produce another metoo product with no real uspmy fear is that jaguar is now damaged goods like alfa and will no longer be taken seriously in the real market outside of us aficionados however well they make it

,https://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&f=247&t=2050500&i=160,read back the point i was making was that no dependable numbers or stats exist yet and for that reason buyers acquiring the cars towards the potential end of battery life will therefore be willing to only pay a small amount limited buyer confidence will cause the cars to depreciate faster beyond a certain agethat sounds terrible for the cars 2nd3rd owners who might lose a chunk due to the car ageing but once running costs are factored in for their ownership there may well not be very much in it vs ice depreciation plus running costs for the same periodits also a likely a temporary problem as we will hopefully learn that most evs dont require a battery swap until theyre approaching the age that value would be extremely low for any car which makes the risk of financial loss very low we need thousands of each make and model of each ev to pass the 10 year100k mark before we can get any worthwhile data people may ask for it sooner but plainly they cant be give figures which dont yet existno one actually needs to take a risk thoigh ice sheds for the masses will be around for at least another 20 years more than enough time to sort battery swapping costs etc bit that is the precise point that im making neither you i nor anyone know the numbers from which value calculations are made some people are asking for those numbers and instead of it being explained that the data doesnt exist yet others are attempting to answer erroneously with platitudes and condescension which given they seemingly wish the slow migration to ev to be successful is a folly but nothing changes the reality that in order to accurately value an ev that is out of battery warranty one must know the cost of that battery replacement its a very basic value calculation that cant actually be done because key data is absent this also impacts the sale of new evs as the financial mechanism used require accurate calculations of the year three value as weve seen those have transpired to have been wrong and a part of the reason for that has been the failure of those manufacturers to deliver clarity on key cost risks post battery warranty periods its actually a failure of the manufacturers to recognise and understand the new product that theyre selling that missing data re projected risk costs post battery warranty is actually preventing them from accurately setting values three years out for their chosen funding mechanism traditionally manufacturers can and do rinse their hands of underpinning the values of their cars once they move them off their balance sheet which is typically and crudely correlates to the period that warranties are offered not extended this is because the pcp deals on new sales are very heavily reliant on knowing the value at the end of the deal that model is t working for evs because of the consumer discounting that you mention which in turn is being driven by the failure of the manufacturers to have realised the huge cost and implication of battery replacement risk long after the car has left their balance sheet is outweighing their ability to control year 3 values etc ie its making new ev sales more expensive because they cannot define those year 3 values accurately enough so while we can say that at some point in the future that data will naturally appear and allow for correct pricing what we can also see is that it is having a detrimental impact on new sales right now because second buyers are discounting excessively to naturally compensate for unknown risks which blows up accurate pcpleasing calcs on new sales a really good example of this would be to look at 8 year old i3 bmws what do you think would be the effect on their values if there was a known and affordable cost of battery upgrade to the 2022 spec what would be the knock on effect to the used cars 48 years where the warranty is in terminal decay phase and subsequently if the i3 were still on sale today what would be the impact from that stability on pcplease pricing people do t realising it but they are pricing risk its actually the manufacturers who have failed to understand this as theyve never had to consider it before yes each buyer from new to shed is going to be impacted by the future unknown value of the cari just dont see that as a problem as such its just a factor of a new type of car new technologies not enough proving time it is perhaps better described as annoying or inconvenient that each person buying and selling the car has to make a vague and hopefully safe assumption based on no real data but thats the deali dont think it will put off most buyers who can afford an ev and actually would quite like to have an evi also think its fairly likely that your i3 example would be worth a lot more if battery replacement was a known and relatively affordable cost especially if it could also be a cist effective time to essentially upgrade the car with bigger battery etc but whilst its a head fk trying to work out if that makes it a good buy today the reality is that through the cars life it has depreciated more so the final owner can now acquire one for thousands less than they would be able to if all things were known its not a certainty they will ever need to replace the battery but if they do they have already effectively had a saving to go towards it the car will also save them at least 1000 a year vs iceoverall despite the big bill being unwelcome it doesnt really do very much to change the value proposition i am aware that despite that logic some people could be very unlucky and that most end of car life buyers probably dont have quick access to such money

,https://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&f=247&t=2044390,we have a 2019 first edition kia eniroa couple of months ago my wife returned from a local shop to find after she had parked that she couldnt get out of the carshe struggled trying to turn the car off and on the car was dead but eventually she found that her drivers side window would open so climbed out through the window and plugged the car in she was then late for another arrangement and so left the car to sort itself outthe following day i discovered the problem and found that the drivers door would open from the outside but the car was deadi pulled out the thick drivers manual and couldnt find anything about a dead batteryi phoned the kia dealer from whom we had bought the car and was told to charge the auxiliary battery i was also asked if the car had a restart the battery switch if it has i cant find it so i opened the bonnet from inside the car and found that the auxiliary battery was reading 4v and i therefore put this on a 5amp charger some hours later i came back to the car it did appear to be charging but the battery voltage was still around 5 volts so i phoned the dealer and asked to speak to a technician apparently this was not possible and i was advised to arrange to have the car recovered which i guess could have been complicated since it was locked in park and plugged into the main battery chargeri figured that either something had discharged the auxiliary battery or this had failed but why wouldnt it charge maybe the charger was sensing a fault or maybe there was a discharge equating to the charge current so i decided to remove the battery to charge it but at the sane time i decided to find collect and fit a new replacement battery there was one at dealership 20 miles away once connected the car sprung back into life and incidentally the old battery still appears to be holding a good charge 127 volts as of now and not touched since charged fully following the lockoutso i tried to get in touch with kia customer service asking to speak with a technician with whom i could share my experience no interest talk to your supplying dealer was the best they could muster then i receive a questionnaire asking about my experience with kia customer care which i of course panned and following which i have heard nothingsince this time amongst family and friends i have discovered two other kia owners who have suffered similar problems being locked in or locked outhow will this problem ever be solved unless the manufacturer will communicate in order to analyse the issue and coordinate at least an action plan to deal with the immediate consequences and then an ownerfix which does not involve recovering the car at great expense inconvenience and possibly collateral damage so have you been locked in your ev if so what happened and how was the problem solved this could be a life threatening issue

,https://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&f=247&t=2045780,so much lack of understanding surrounding this issuetheyre fast because they can be it costs the manufacturer and driver next to nothing in terms of upfront or running costs or range apart from the extra weight and cost of the wheels tyres brakes and anything else that needs upgrading to cope with the extra bhp there is a weight and cost penalty when you get to a dual motor evs because youre dragging around the weight and cost of an extra motor but such cars are performance models and are supposed to appeal in terms of speed and power even then the actual range impact of the extra motor weight is very little if driven gently ie a tm3 single motor might cost 65 to do 200 miles a tm3lr dual motor might cost 750or to put it another way you can increase the range by about 15 by avoiding the dual motor 4wd version im fed up with reading the new fandangomobile has a skateboard battery and the option of either one motor and 2wd or 2 motors and 4wd with the top model having 500bhp and a 062 time of 3 seconds how much cheaper lighter more spacious and more economical would it be if it wasnt designed and developed to cope with the demands of the top modelyoure looking at this from an ice point of view you should ask questions and gain a better understanding ahead of deciding youre fed up with something i dont know why the power of a car you have would make you fed up anywaytheres nothing to be fed up about whatever ev you might buy isnt going to cost you more because its quite a bit nippier than the ice equivalent all evs have invested more than enough in the suspension in order to handle the cars weight the extra power doesnt add any additional burden unless its a performance orientated car in which case of course you can pay more for a better setupyou dont need to upgrade the wheels or brakes on an ice you need to upgrade the brakes but on an ev the brakes receive so much support via regen its not required unless the car is crazy fast or designed for track use tyres are normally the same across the range of power outputs for a model of ev other than on the top models which sometimes have performance tyres even then its typically an optionif you buy a new ev and it has 250hp instead of the 160hp ice equivalent you really wont be paying a premium for that additional power its just a byproduct of ev design
