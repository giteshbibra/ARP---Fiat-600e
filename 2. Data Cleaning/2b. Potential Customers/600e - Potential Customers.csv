2024-03-08,AXGNb76QgH0,25000 is a fair price
2024-03-04,AXGNb76QgH0,it looks solid and i know its a great driving machine
2024-02-24,AXGNb76QgH0,really love the video and review of new fiat 600e and after weekend ive spend with this beautifull and fun to drive car i have to say that i really love it
2024-02-16,AXGNb76QgH0,imagine if fiat invested in perfecting the 500 platform to increase performance reliability and build quality vs redesigning and releasing a brand new model relying on things like design is contemporary and up to tastes which may change on you its hard to argue that performance and reliability will not be towards the top of buyers wish list
2024-02-13,AXGNb76QgH0,my wife has a 500 c and all we love it nobody knows why because as a car is not the best but instead of our bigger car we use it also for longer summer trips this 600 e is the perfect rletive with our small fifi so i am thinking abut it
2024-02-13,AXGNb76QgH0,why are most evs suvs
2024-01-28,AXGNb76QgH0,a french carüòé
2023-12-18,AXGNb76QgH0,the 600e has two things i wish fiat will upgrade the 500e with first a better shock absorber second a modern steering wheel without all those black piano surface
2023-12-14,AXGNb76QgH0,why she acting like this is so new its literally a fiat 500x but electric ffs
2024-03-06,AXGNb76QgH0,it is based on new platform new interior new body nothing to do with 500x
2023-11-16,AXGNb76QgH0,oh dear fiat played a blinder with its cute 500 and even after 17 years it remains one of their best sellers but someone needs to tell them that theyve overdone the cuteness with this one those headlights look so much like eyes it has to be a joke why does everything have to be feminised these days it might appeal to hairdressers and aerobic instructors but i think id feel a bit of a dck driving around in one of these
2023-11-13,AXGNb76QgH0,why would you buy that a hyundai kona ev limited with way more bells and whistles more power more range faster charging more space similar size and cost less
2023-11-08,AXGNb76QgH0,i dont understand why anyone looking in this market segment would not buy the volvo ex30 it offers so much more than everything else at a similar price or even quite a lot higher price as long as people can cope without a separate drivers display
2023-10-30,AXGNb76QgH0,con il piano a induzione carbonara perfetta
2023-10-30,AXGNb76QgH0,i am sorry but i dont know if it is me being spoiled entitled stingy or something else but 40 thousand euros for a subcompact car it is not fabulous in any way you still have to pay for the charging i mean i would just go and buy a well equipped mercedes a class saloon which is pretty much a bc segment car and looks and feels great
2023-10-30,AXGNb76QgH0,ill wait for the hybrid to come to the uk
2023-10-26,AXGNb76QgH0,damn this reviewer is ace
2023-10-25,AXGNb76QgH0,malcolmbennett4325 0 seconds ago nice car but sorry too expensive its should priced at 2k123k
2023-10-25,AXGNb76QgH0,33 grand haha are you seriously telling me a fiat punto one of the cheapest cars on the planet has now developed into a car worth more tha a jaguar or mercedes or even a porche i can buy a top notch top of the range super duper car for the price of this orange cameflaged milk float it is getting ridiculous now
2023-10-24,AXGNb76QgH0,so 45000 for a fiat ye sad to say i do not see many of these being sold in ireland affordable my ass a volvo ex30 also costs from 45000 here some rip off
2023-10-23,AXGNb76QgH0,i find it really hard to enjoy reviews by this lady maybe its just me
2023-10-21,AXGNb76QgH0,did she say 37k for the top one for a fiat
2023-10-21,AXGNb76QgH0,putting what looks like an ipad cover inside a car is a bad move that will be ruined in a couple of years
2023-10-19,AXGNb76QgH0,if its an ev itll be rubbish
2023-10-19,AXGNb76QgH0,shoes match the bulky car
2023-10-19,AXGNb76QgH0,she looks molto bella the car that is my understanding is that cars are considered feminine in italian
2023-10-18,AXGNb76QgH0,nice car by the way its based on a platform jointly developed by psa and saic automobiles so the platform is half french and half chinese the jeep avenger which again is also based on this platform was not developed in the states by jeep but in italy by fiat üòÖ
2023-10-17,AXGNb76QgH0,this car would be great if it had more range like 500 km wltp would be good i think they could achieve this with better aerodynamics efficiency improvements and bigger battery
2023-10-16,AXGNb76QgH0,is this video for real saying it looks like this or that its an electric 500x
2023-10-16,AXGNb76QgH0,fiat fix it again tony
2023-10-16,AXGNb76QgH0,nice car too bad its electric
2023-10-20,AXGNb76QgH0,luckily it is electric
2023-10-15,AXGNb76QgH0,i like fiat they get a bad rep from lots of journos for some unknown reason but they make great little cars that are fun to drive wife had a yellow panda for 11 years and was her favourite car ever keep doing what youre doing fiatstellantis
2023-11-01,AXGNb76QgH0,stellantis geh√∂rt die zukunft und allen ihren marken
2023-10-15,AXGNb76QgH0,stellantis really did just ctrlc ctrlv the interior of the fiat 600e and jeep avenger
2023-10-14,AXGNb76QgH0,same platform as jeep and build in the same factory no thanks dont have time for repairing every month
2023-12-06,AXGNb76QgH0,but for som reason youre have time to be narrow minded
2023-10-13,AXGNb76QgH0,stop with this ev nonsense already
2023-10-20,AXGNb76QgH0,tell me more what is nonsense 3 years driving an ev and never go back
2023-10-12,AXGNb76QgH0,i really like this car but as the owner of a corsa e i have to stay away from stellantis evs in future been in the garage more with my 12k mile corsa than my previous 100k mile suzuki swift as the 600e is basically the same car underneath cant see it being much different to be honest
2023-10-11,AXGNb76QgH0,probably the most pedestrian ev to date
2023-10-10,AXGNb76QgH0,beautiful woman en fiat 600 kiss
2023-10-09,AXGNb76QgH0,is it just me who gets irritated that every review ive seen of the 600 never mentions the 500x on which it is clearly based
2023-10-18,AXGNb76QgH0,well because it is not theyre two totally different cars under the skin the 600 is really similar to the peugeot 2008 the 500x uses the jeep renegade fca small base
2023-11-06,AXGNb76QgH0,alfonsotatto8365 its still a spiritual successor not to mention how similar it looks and with good reason both the 600 and 500x before it are designed to look like beefed up versions of the old 500 new 500e respectively i just find it odd how thats never mentioned as though the whole concept of the 600 a bigger 500 with suv styling is entirely new
2023-11-06,AXGNb76QgH0,chrisdevine4848 yes its the 500x successor but it is a completely different car underneath i just wanted to point that out moreover on the italian market we still have the 500x i dont know if elsewhere it is the same but officially in italy the 600 does not replace the 500x they will live together for a couple of years still
2023-11-07,AXGNb76QgH0,alfonsotatto8365 fair enough i read the 500x was being discontinued here in the uk soon with fiat moving all electric
2023-10-08,AXGNb76QgH0,u knows its gonna be a st car when its a collaboration of fiat jeep vauxhall peugeot
2023-10-20,AXGNb76QgH0,sherukka yeah vw are not as great as they used to be but every manufacturer makes better cars than stellantis group
2023-12-08,AXGNb76QgH0,mixedbyfiatcat german jap and korean cars are okay i have a bmw
2023-10-08,AXGNb76QgH0,its a fiat so 50k miles will be end of economic life
2023-10-07,AXGNb76QgH0,took one on a test drive straight away brake failure
2023-10-07,AXGNb76QgH0,i would like a fiat e128
2023-10-07,AXGNb76QgH0,electric cars are so expensive
2023-10-06,AXGNb76QgH0,fiat is trying to fool me with great looking cars but i wont be fooled üòÇ
2023-12-06,AXGNb76QgH0,mixedbyfiatcat youre in denial
2023-10-06,AXGNb76QgH0,as much as i am enjoying her review this is the first time im seeing her ever i am cringing hard on her technique with the wheel shes holding it just a bit better than id expect a toddler to hold it common step up your game
2023-10-06,AXGNb76QgH0,my willingness to buy a car with approval of alex explodes tenfold some brand should hire her as an ambassador or something
2023-10-06,AXGNb76QgH0,cute stylish and capitvating the fiat isnt bad either great review as always alex
2023-10-06,AXGNb76QgH0,fantastic review showed all the positives while pointing out the negatives but in a fair way not an annoying one like reviewers from other channels tend to to do great job alexandra
2023-10-06,AXGNb76QgH0,same price you buy the wonderful chinese li7 or li 9
2023-10-14,AXGNb76QgH0,xmaniac99 lixiang li 7 or li 9 ev
2023-10-20,AXGNb76QgH0,who in their right mind would ever buy a chinese car do some research about whats go s on there and dont tell me that every car has parts from china because that has nothing to do with the issues of china cars
2023-10-06,AXGNb76QgH0,so on average you will spend 35k on a parts bin special and all the journos want to talk about is speed y
2023-10-06,AXGNb76QgH0,all mainstream commuter cars have been parts bin specials since the 90s where have you been
2023-10-06,AXGNb76QgH0,i would not call 33k good value for a fiat
2023-10-06,AXGNb76QgH0,man i love auto trader the best car channel on youtube period üòÉüòÅi love fiat as well so keep them coming
2023-10-05,AXGNb76QgH0,what a jolly adorable car how cute double it and give it to the next person
2023-10-05,AXGNb76QgH0,im a men without inferiority complex and only thing ill say just shut up and take my money d that thing is cute as hell and in the same time its practical and sporty kindof d
2023-10-05,AXGNb76QgH0,for a second i thought alexandra was going to fiddle around the car like say fiat like the bentley girl did
2023-10-05,AXGNb76QgH0,a true mongrel and not worth the price
2023-10-05,AXGNb76QgH0,brilliant presenter fun in an electric pumpkin
2023-10-05,AXGNb76QgH0,fun seriously there is nothing fun about this car unless we have very different view what is fun
2023-10-05,AXGNb76QgH0,no problem with stellantis using the same parts on multiple cars as they need to build large numbers in order to keep the prices down however this is exactly where stellantis loose out their rrp is too high dealers then offer discounts which sounds ok unless you paid full rrp and it is worth 50 less after 2 years like the current mokka ev that has lost massively on its residential values
2023-10-20,AXGNb76QgH0,it feels very nippy when you go off the line no need for 3 sec in any car except for men without bals üòÇ
2023-10-05,AXGNb76QgH0,great review 3
2023-10-05,AXGNb76QgH0,ghastly looking thing and the price nope
2023-10-05,AXGNb76QgH0,how can this do 372 miles around town with a 54kwh battery thats consistently 7miles a kwh which would make it the worlds most efficient 626
2023-10-05,AXGNb76QgH0,i think she ment 372 kilometers not miles
2023-10-18,AXGNb76QgH0,no she meant miles in the wltp city cycle electric cars have massive range basically because they use just a little power to move and also recharge the battery while decelerating
2023-10-05,AXGNb76QgH0,the bigger the badge the worse the car
2023-10-06,AXGNb76QgH0,i think fiat has retired from the us market now
2023-10-11,AXGNb76QgH0,oh get a grip why would the us want this car
2023-10-12,AXGNb76QgH0,huracan360 the fiat 500e is set to be released in north america next year so you never know
2023-12-06,AXGNb76QgH0,huracan360 no the 500ev is coming in early 2024 to the us in selected big cities
2023-10-05,AXGNb76QgH0,cute car for first car owners and drivers
2023-10-05,AXGNb76QgH0,knowing fiat you will have as much fun being in the 600e as in the shops getting it fixed
2023-10-05,AXGNb76QgH0,id be shocked if it does break interior wise and as far as some parts go yes but its hopefully never gonna be a single issue with the battery pack
2023-10-06,AXGNb76QgH0,still in 2023 with this clich√© really update your poor car knowledge fiat has grown up a lot is ppl like you that hasnt
2023-10-06,AXGNb76QgH0,ive had a 500e for two years and nothing has gone wrong its such a dull cliche thats fiat always break
2023-10-06,AXGNb76QgH0,its an electric car i highly doubt theyll have the same issues as the ice cars
2023-10-10,AXGNb76QgH0,youre way behind the times i had a fiat for years and it never broke down once i highly recommend them as safe sound cars
2023-10-13,AXGNb76QgH0,fiat bravo tjet sport 2009still using it without any problem cut the crap with fiat
2023-10-14,AXGNb76QgH0,lel driven four pandas in the family over 30 years in total except for service and wear tear no issues what so ever even the one with the puny 2 cyl turbo engine turned out to be a champ
2023-10-16,AXGNb76QgH0,my niece has a 500l which is supposed to be a terrible car but with 100 000 miles on it it has been a very dependable little suv
2023-10-17,AXGNb76QgH0,nice design the italian flag on the bumper though is cheesy
2023-10-18,AXGNb76QgH0,that comment tells that actually you dont know anything about cars
2023-10-18,AXGNb76QgH0,jealous german fanboy üòÇ imagine but fiats dont brake that often
2023-11-16,AXGNb76QgH0,oh get up to speed fiat used to have a pretty rickety reputation for quality but thats all changed we had a 500 for 8 years and the only attention it needed aside from the yearly service was for a broken rear light fords are much worse
2023-11-26,AXGNb76QgH0,by writing this you show your lack of knowledge about fiat i drive their cars 20 years and never had any problem
2023-11-27,AXGNb76QgH0,xmaniac99 it wasnt puny though it was the most powerful engine in the entire 500 range 104 hp and went like a little devil 062 in 10 secs and about 2 secs faster than the standard 12 litre
2023-11-27,AXGNb76QgH0,andyhowlett2231 my puny i mean the actual physical size of the engine for me it is one of the engineering wonders of the last thirty years only two brands in the world can build these kind of engines fiat and bmw
2024-02-02,AXGNb76QgH0,i would never buy a fiat in north america but i dont see why not in europe parts should be common and affordable
2024-05-03,MvgfB8kcS1s,stupid fiat taken out the interial mood lighting for uk why whats the point ussless
2024-04-16,MvgfB8kcS1s,italian design outside but de facto chassis and engine are french and buildt in poland fiat is also now in holland to pay less tax the italian flag here and there is a joke
2024-04-14,MvgfB8kcS1s,so the bdrive replaces the range mode of the 500e wich is one pedal drive or is there still one pedal drive in a different mode
2024-04-14,MvgfB8kcS1s,she already made a video on this car saying how she hated its appearance and in this video she says she likes it
2024-04-14,MvgfB8kcS1s,living with a car for a week makes a difference and often letting a design sink in can change your opinion
2024-04-13,MvgfB8kcS1s,not nice car at all pass
2024-04-14,MvgfB8kcS1s,fair enough its definitely not for everyone
2024-04-11,MvgfB8kcS1s,tish has become really good at this this was the best review of the 600e that i have seen so far
2024-04-11,MvgfB8kcS1s,this car falls apart in 20k km üò¢
2024-04-10,MvgfB8kcS1s,another great review tish i have always liked the look of the 500 but these bigger versions look a little too over sized i think its all the smooth rounded corners looks like an overweight toddler but i do like it over the 500x
2024-04-10,MvgfB8kcS1s,sums up fiat cheap and value drops like a stone a better buy at 3 years old
2024-04-09,MvgfB8kcS1s,im so not interested in this car but still watched the whole review just because its one of tishs üòÇ auto social uk seems to be at the top of my subscription list all the time now üòä
2024-04-09,MvgfB8kcS1s,very good car for a girl
2024-04-08,MvgfB8kcS1s,hi tish another excellent reviewwill you have the opportunity to review the hybrid fiat 600
2024-05-25,MvgfB8kcS1s,well ill be keeping my 2 l 4x4 diesel auto 500x dont want anything french or powered by petrol or battery
2024-04-08,MvgfB8kcS1s,a good detailed review thank you tish stellantis really need to move on from this compromised platform for their smaller evs they need to move to a dedicated ev platform have faster charging proper regenerative brake options and the longer wheelbase and better interior packaging you get when you dont have to accommodate a combustion powertrain
2024-04-09,MvgfB8kcS1s,bill_heywood so their balanced approach seems to be sensible and the ev native platforms are just coming
2024-04-11,MvgfB8kcS1s,jackweednm1vqit might have made sense in 2018 but launching a new ev on a combustion platform in 2024 just leads to a sub optimal car
2024-04-08,MvgfB8kcS1s,love the review especially detailing the range the problem with fiat and alfa etc is that i cant see the car in real because all showrooms are closed in london may be they should be do pop up stores in shopping centres i am a mokka e owner and looking at it the lack of rear interior lighting and door grap handles in this fiat will put me off would you say the smart 1 is better than this the hybrid version of the fiat seems good value though see you on the milano review soon üòÇ
2024-04-08,MvgfB8kcS1s,the fiat 500 was always a cute looking car before they started messing with it not really my sort of car im afraid
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,nice looking car pity its a milk float
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,does it has got liion battery pack or something made from else and heatpump
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,do none of the cars you drive come with android auto as you only ever say it has apple airplay please note the vast majority of people prefer android phones over apple so please can you acknowledge that there are other phones out there sounds like your label dropping all the time
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,i hate the exterior design of this car and that its so small the interior has nice seats nice features and a beautiful flat bottom steering wheel apart from that theres nothing else that interest me on this car i wouldnt be getting one period good üòä review tish
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,another excellent review tish a new e208 to replace our 3 year old e208 may well be on the cards if the efficiency is as good as you say it is that is the only disappointment with it especially in winter and the lack of true 1 pedal driving
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,ive always loved fiat cars and owned fiat cars also however my policy on evs is this i will never buy an ev until im able to charge directly into a normal domestic electric point without the need for a charging box
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,a decent priced phev with at least 100 km electric range would be nice
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,nice review except some important information is missing does it have a heat pump and battery preheating things havent developed very much with stellantis evs as my 38 kw hyundai ioniq can easily get 200 mile range and over 6 miles per kilowatt hour
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,stevenjones916 neither do you apparently
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,nice little car cheers tish
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,lovely looking car
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,i really like this car my current car is a 500x so its a natural move to electric for me im put off by the fact that its stellantis as it has all the problems all stellantis cars have mostly that they still have transmission tunnels etc but its a serious contender and i sill definitely test drive one i think √Æm gravitating towards the facelifted id3 more but theres so much to like about the 600 not least the lovely buttons
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,not for me expensive and flawed ice chassis no one pedal driving great reviews though
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,i might do when it arrives i opted to try the petrol version of the jeep avenger instead of electric
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,genuinely very good in the ev
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,cracking review tish lets just say not my kind of car
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,for all normal purposes we dont really need more than a fiat 500who does if they dont have kids ad our dog and we need the boot that comes with the extra 100
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,where on gods earth is the 9000 pound difference still no adequate infrastructure for people with no drives and i dont think that car makers still are not interested
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,yes its an interesting time because we still have some way to go with everything for sure
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,great video tish the audio is on point the efficiency is excellent the lack of 1 pedal driving is a bit of a shame but it looks good im excited for the abarth 600e
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,thank you so much ill never go back now ive found that ai clean up omg im really excited for the abarth one too
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,autosocialuk love the audio for when youre not driving however when you are driving its nice to hear how loud the cabin gets and silly things like the thunk of the door etc
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,fiat is fun fabulous and fantastic
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,well done on 45k subscribers tish loved watching your review
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,its a nice electric city suv
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,very good and informative review thanks a lot tish
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,like you said 33 large ones its a lot of money one could get a preowned tesla for that price that will depreciate a lot less and its a much more mature proposition or a mg4 it seems to me that the competition within the stellantis group puts the 600e at the top end of the tariff and if we factor in sharp depreciation on brands like peugeot or opelvauxhall unless someone really want those embroidered seats its difficult to make a case for it going back to another competitor you tested i went to look at the mini countryman in the flesh in a very postmodern colour scheme light green and gold with cream roof and honestly the car looked better with you in it but without that halfthought door panel with orange and blue with a completely different colour scheme is just naff at 50 grand for the electric one üòÇüòÇüòÇ
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,one could buy two second hand teslas for that price
2024-04-09,MvgfB8kcS1s,you get 2 top of the line and mint condition mercedes benz s500 2011 year for that price
2024-04-22,MvgfB8kcS1s,i mean the urban range is great also i dont think its fair to compare a used car to a new car and the fiat is also made in europe so thats a plus
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,this really is one of the best car review channels on youtube
2024-04-08,MvgfB8kcS1s,absolutely i only watch her car reviews now
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,great review but must keep this review away from my wife she loves the style of the 500 but i persuaded her it was too small when we got our last ev however id end up cleaning those light seats virtually every day üòÇ
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,another great review tish ive been driving alfas abarths and fiats for the last 20 years and loved them all even with their quirkiness but unfortunately my next car is less likely to be a fiat our current 500x is just a bit too tight in the back for legroom so no chance with the 600 i like this car i would have one but its too small in the back for our needs for the next few years and im a bit gutted about it i also think that stellantis electric cars are too expensive at the moment especially compared to the hybrids they have rushed to get out looking forward to your next one
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,i was kind of gutted about the space in the back as well really not practical for families it was the zero storage that got me the most its fun but just there to satisfy the suv addiction with young girls i think youre right theyre way to expensive and unfortunately those poor performance figures in the early days made the prices hard to justify 30k isnt too bad when you take off the grant but then thats the less equipped red model this one is more like 34 with the grant
2024-04-08,MvgfB8kcS1s,minulla on fiat tipo sw ja se on todella tilava auto my√∂s takana jalkatila on luokkansa suurimpia
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,excellent review tish
2024-04-07,MvgfB8kcS1s,great looking car
2024-03-22,eZMrw98nHgU,it would be nice if the camera man stop focusing on her and on the car instead for example show us the thing that she pointed out so we can go along with what she is talking about
2024-03-16,eZMrw98nHgU,jesus christ saves he had mercy on me he can save all who all seek him today he made away through calvery repent of all sins today romans 623 for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord come to jesus christ today jesus christ is only way to heaven repent and follow him today seek his heart jesus christ can fill the emptiness he can fill the void heaven and hell is real cone to the loving savior today today is the day of salvation tomorrow might be to late come to the loving savior today holy spirit can give you peace purpose and joy and his will today john 31621 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life 17 for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved 18 he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god 19 and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil 20 for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved 21 but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god mark 115 15 and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel 2 peter 39 the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to usward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance hebrews 116 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him jesus
2024-03-12,eZMrw98nHgU,who is this car for exactly
2024-03-10,eZMrw98nHgU,ive got the rose gold 500e and i am 100 upgrading to this in about a year or so if i can wait that long i did get the 3k off mine so the 3k off this one is welcomed i am a little disappointed to hear this isnt as nippy as the 500 as i love the speed of the 500 but i will have to test drive see what its like for me thanks for the video
2024-03-10,eZMrw98nHgU,i much more prefer fiat 500e its much more suitable as italian style icon and actually great fun ev to drive
2024-03-10,eZMrw98nHgU,another overpriced milk float
2024-03-09,eZMrw98nHgU,dullsville overpricedprefer the styling of the 500xlazy styling from fiat
2024-03-09,eZMrw98nHgU,never mind getting kids into the back i think elderly relatives will be left standing at the kerbside
2024-03-09,eZMrw98nHgU,apart from the side windows it looks much like the original eniro
2024-03-09,eZMrw98nHgU,fiat shouldve done a 500e giardinia estate and this 600e shouldve been a multipla
2024-03-09,eZMrw98nHgU,sorry fiat but not attractive üòä
2024-03-09,eZMrw98nHgU,buy a toyota lexus hybrid much reliable dump the ev anxiety evi expensive repair costs will wipe out all your ev savings 3 times more than petrol ice cars ev are worth paying only 2k because of expensive repair costs when it becomes faulty
2024-03-09,eZMrw98nHgU,so they can take 3 grand off and still make a profit greedy bastards and no my happiness level is not 10
2024-03-09,eZMrw98nHgU,for comparison fiat 500e is group 17 and very cheap to insure but the 600e is in group 2526 according to diesel and eco car magazine this is about average for this size of ev
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,a good review but the looks rather strange and awkward why stick a cartoon human face on the front of the car
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,great review nicki where is the stunning bomber jacket from
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,a great review nicki the prices though well err well its all marketing speak isnt it fiat saying these are the prices but well give you a pile of money deposit if you get one who will buy one at retail anyway its a nice car but im unsure if itll be on my test drive list the 500 in my book has a much more character but folding the kids in half to fit them in the back in tantrum mode could sway many views i think
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,it is a shame fiat 600 seems like nice but it is way to expensive for what it is honestly i do struggle to understand the thoughts process of ev makers 33k 37k if we are hoping for mass adoption of evs they have to be less greedy
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,thanks for the review we loved the 500e and that it came with a cabrio version didnt like the price thou what we dont get is why people need 4 door saloons for the rare occasion that the friends dont have a car and claim yours to be transported we are a household of 2 and never ever need more than a 2door car when the kids with grandkids ask us to take the grandkids we also switch cars so nobody is needlessly riding around all year with a car that is to expansive to big to heavy and uses to much energy for every km we really dont get that urge for a behemoth suv like all the neighbors in the street wasnt an ev all about better for the environment so why bigger heavier more material and more expansive for that 1 time a year to transport friends cant they take the bus
2024-03-09,eZMrw98nHgU,both my wife and me drive a 4 door saloon i dont understand why you would buy a 2 door as you mention those are sport cars like a 911 bmw m2 toyota supra alpine etc talking about waste of energy yeah sure what 2 door are your driving
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,poor car looks stoned af from all that gelato
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,nope over priced compared with byd and prices in china do these manufacturers think we are stupid we know how to use the internet and see prices in other countries for similar or exactly the same products the car is nice its a sub 15k ev extended range maybe under 20k and it will be a runner in the uk and why have they put the italian flag colours on the car when its made in poland
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,its looks are a bit too awkward to fully invoke the 500e but a tad bigger charm and the price is too close to a better equipped tesla model 3 sr or a smart 1 which both also give rear wheel drive and feel much less budget carlike at least over here in europe im not sure how the prices compare exactly over there here la prima is priced higher than both other models i mentioned
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,154 house power is enough not loads and struggles a bit on a motorway if you want to overtake itll be fine driving around town or at moderate speeds what154 is not a small number far from it and gets to 60mph in 9 secondsthats actually pretty fast please stop saying clearly silly things in these reviews and just present the facts
2024-03-10,eZMrw98nHgU,thats not silly its intentional to sublimely degrade certain cars or brands where there is it due to presenters personal taste or something else is another thingüòâ
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,it looks like a great 20000 usd car
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,isnt this an electrified version of fiats 500x
2024-03-10,eZMrw98nHgU,no its completely different and unrelated car mechanically is closer to mokka or 2008 than to 500x
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,that cover on the centre console is a deal breaker i think it would be better just left open im also not sold on the headlights either 33k37k üòÆ citroen ec3 and renault 5 feel like a more interesting choice for both design and price
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,good review after initial dissapointment i am now more interested in this car i like the interior
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,shame the hybrid doesnt come with full black interior it has lost a sale from me as this looks amazing i have no choice but to go for a 500x
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,my wife has always loved the look of these miniscule fiats it would be a great little urban runabout a roadtrip would be a bit grueling i think the front end has a sleepy look or suspicious doubtful skeptical hold on gray is a boring shade no my cybergray ioniq 5 is a real head turner
2024-03-09,eZMrw98nHgU,thats because your ioniq 5 is dystopian future retro and the fiat is more retro retro and suited to the warmer mediterranean hues
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,question does these expensive cars from stellantis imply that they really dont want to sell their cars or does it mean that they cant make price competitive value cars
2024-03-09,eZMrw98nHgU,stellantis aside from tesla is the only company whos ev division are turning a profit hyundaikia ford bmw etc are all subsidising the cost of their evs from their ice platforms
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,i know ill never own a fiat not my style i came here to watch nikki üôÇ
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,have you ever seen this 4500 charge on ev charger feel free to spead the word on this scam httpsyoutuberjzyjenw0rk
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,the truth is that all of stellantis evs are way overpriced the list price for the 600 should start at 27k
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,finally colors in the statesits usually a choice of of black some shade of grey or whitewith blue and red being excitingif you consider shades of grey a wide spectrum of choices i love watching yalls critique of cars
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,too expensive for a small car ill wait for a cheaper byd
2024-03-10,eZMrw98nHgU,yes chinese byd burn your drive
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,that is a peugeot e2008 with a fiat clothing üòÇ you can see the e208 wing mirror
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,not the 1st time she had some nuts in her
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,given that clearly looking at the interior this is a reskinned jeep avenger i wouldnt touch it with a bargepole given how that car seems to have major problems brand new in almost every review its strange given the ec4 2008 etc seem to be just fine on the same platform
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,most of the interior parts instruments and buttons in the avenger originally appeared in the fiat 500e and after 2years and 37000 miles i havent had a single issue with mine
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,gileshalliwell3591 im sure the fiat 500e is great the problems with the jeep avenger thats on a different platform seem to be more about random brake failures drivetrain failures and having to restart the car and let it power off for a while i just pointed out the interior as a sign of how related this 600 and the avenger are
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,vehicle choice is becoming illusory opel vauxhall fiat citroen peugeot jeep are the same manufacturer slapping out the same basic vehicle in different shells vw skoda seat cupra are the same manufacturer slapping the same basic vehicle in different shells even the chinese are doing it with volvo smart and zeekr at some point it will become like sunglasses where no matter what brand you buy chances are a single manufacturer is behind them all with a markup to match
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,thanks for this really like this car in black colormore then others stellantis nice interior and instrument cluster but you should test the cheaper modelred insteadbetter comfort with smaller wheels and more stylish interior in black and red
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,difficult to accept that this is the company that gave us so many innovative and stylish cars talking nonsense about colour shows they are struggling to talk about the car its overpriced ugly and very underwhelming
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,i dont understand you fuff about the innovative cover for the center storage but accept that you have to pay extra for 1 usb port in the rear and multi level load floor also do we need a powerhatch or a properly engineered balanced manual hatch door
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,yeah no another overpriced dated car from stellantis
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,yudhabagaskara98 the thing is some people want a less out there design and if they dont theres the jeep avenger and others in the stellantis stable under the skin theyre all pretty similarjust trying to target different cars to different buyers technically they are up to date priceyoull probably need to get a discount
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,i am not talking about the design by the way it is ok in that aspect
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,freddykrueger79 its exactly what vw do with audi skoda and the other one that used to be called seat the philosophy isnt a bad one
2024-03-09,eZMrw98nHgU,stephen546 it starts at 35k euro for the ev version here 42k for a nice one it does have its own style which i do appreciate a few cars to consider instead model 3 mg4 vw id3 yes even this it has better software way better assist systems more space a bit more range charges faster is rwd which works better than fwd for evs trust me has way more power and is a joy to drive if the car was 30 k yes but not 35k starting and 42k for a nice one competition is too hot for that with these stats and that cheap interior
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,one problem across all stellantis products they just cost too much for what is a fossil car with batteries shoved in they absolutely need to start to produce more ev only platforms as the tidal wave of new technology cars is really growing bigger and bigger 2024 and 2025 are the breakout years for evs and stellantis are starting to fall behind everyone else nice but
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,it really depends on the market because this particular car is priced lower than anything from the vw group hyundai or tesla and i dont just mean by a few coins but by more than 10 our price for the base spec including tax and fees is under 27k at the current exchange rate
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,dqtube but it has to be cheaper because is not really an ev its a fossil car with batteries forced in and it feels that way its a much more competitive market now for this class of car and stellantis have yet to create a competitive ev platform at a time that the other oems are mostly on to version 2 or even 3 ev they are seriously falling behind now 23 years ago they could get away with it but the world is moving on at pace
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,certainly in the uk stellantis products never sell at their list price ive just put in an order for a ec4 that i should collect next week which is a whopping 10k under list price a much more reasonable 245k similar prices to the ice equivalent given stellantis has spent a lot of the rnd money they really should be simply lowering list prices rather than discounting majorly
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,raubuhn4354 completely agree and a similar price to the fossil cars is fine that pretty much where they should be
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,patrickjr11 its nice in theory but normal people dont care if the platform is pure electric or shared with an ice vehicle as long as theyre switching from an ice or hybrid why should they pay an extra 10 15 just because it is developed as a pure ev for the same money they can buy this car pv panels level 2 charger or they can go your way and just buy an pure ev car and
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,dqtube but pure evs are getting cheaper and cheaper especially with the new platforms because once you have everything set up they are cheaper to make and are roomier inside and feel more modern by now stellantis should have dedicated platforms across the board its all very slow
2024-03-10,eZMrw98nHgU,patrickjr11 im sorry why exactly should ev platforms be cheaper to make platforms are steel frames that have to withstand the loads ensure the necessary torsion stiffness and provide adequate safety for the occupants you know platforms are frames they bolt engine and transmission into and then hang on it stuff like doors bumpeers fenders windows etc frankly the only really substantial difference between and ev and ice platform is that ev platform doesnt have to have an exhausttransmission tunnel across it and evs are roomier because they are usually taller have a flatter to be true but much fatter floor than ice cars otherwise theres no particular technological advance of ev platform over ice one if that wouldnt be the case the new 3008 that is also built on new evice capable platform shouldnt be able to fit 98kwh battery
2024-03-10,eZMrw98nHgU,mirkozlikovski9553 they are usually cheaper because there is less interaction on the production line less components either at sub component level or on final assembly and less staff interaction per car
2024-03-11,eZMrw98nHgU,patrickjr11 if we are talking about platform alone then i doubt that platform is a welded sheet metal you might be right about the whole assembly process but even if ev vehicles are made out of less components they are more expensive than ice components and i believe that ev platform is more expensive than ice platform because it has to house a bunch of batteries and as such if nothing else has to have a double floor
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,nice but the reality is there will be a lot more than 3000 off the list price in a couple of months still too expensive for what it is and expect them to be selling for 25k very shortly and top specs under 30k stellantis list prices are complete fantasy
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,oh great another stellantis product review üòÇüòÇüòÇ i actuallyreally like the 600e
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,so if theres a hatch at the back hence hatchback two doors on the left and two doors on the right wheres the fifth door i never get why companies use 35 door monikers when theyve already categorised the extra door as a hatch which is what it is not a doorüôÉüôÇüòâ
2024-03-08,eZMrw98nHgU,very interesting car we definitely more a family practical evs
2024-02-29,HAZC8wrWQGM,looks good but all these evs are way too expensive people have no idea how long the batteries will last not just charge but actual battery and how much are repairs and servicing makers will have to drop prices significantly if they want people to buy them
2023-11-10,HAZC8wrWQGM,looks like a great car and a great size nice work fiat hopefully we see more like this from manufacturers rather than the buslike behemoth cars that are becoming more and more common
2023-10-25,HAZC8wrWQGM,nice car but sorry too expensive its should priced at 2k123k
2023-10-02,HAZC8wrWQGM,thanks for a great review vicky
2023-09-30,HAZC8wrWQGM,looks like another strong offering from stellantis i appreciate they are all variations on a theme but they are at least visually different enough to justify their existence and this 600e has some really nice design details and references if they can get the price right in the face of the onslaught from the far east i think it will do well
2023-09-28,HAZC8wrWQGM,the cutesy face is a bit too much cartoon like
2023-09-28,HAZC8wrWQGM,i took one look at the thumbnail said is that car wearing mascara d also put some black dots or spots on it call it a lady bug d
2023-09-27,HAZC8wrWQGM,if it wasnt a suv or cute id buy it back to the drawing board fiat
2023-09-27,HAZC8wrWQGM,having seen a few of these reviews now the 600e really seems to be hitting efficiency numbers with one channel quoting 6kw per mile and they werent even trying to be efficient
2023-09-27,HAZC8wrWQGM,a car for nipping to the shops at 33000 üòµ i know that all new car prices for both ev and pistonpowered have skyrocketed over the last 2 years but that seems like a huge price to pay for a simple runaround
2023-09-27,HAZC8wrWQGM,the fiats headlights make it look like shes making sly vixen eyes at you
2023-09-27,HAZC8wrWQGM,big discounts will soon be available i was in a peugeot dealer last saturday and they were offering 17k off a top of the range 308 hybrid they were struggling to shift it even with that discount private buyers just dont want these super expensive cars
2023-09-27,HAZC8wrWQGM,üòÇdidnt you review this last week
2023-09-27,HAZC8wrWQGM,as a car guy id spend that kind of money on a mazda mx5 or maybe a corolla cross or sedan etc if i wanted a family car
2023-09-27,HAZC8wrWQGM,i dont see the point in pushing evs when the urban environment people who live in apartments especially lacks charging infrastructure also they take too long to charge and cost too much and the range doesnt justify the price you pay for them
2023-09-27,HAZC8wrWQGM,its not the range which justifies the price its the low running costs which do yes evs should cost less but even now they make sense for most people the cost per mile is less than petroldiesel and the lower number of parts means theres less to go wrong
2023-09-27,HAZC8wrWQGM,charliegb03 but theres a lack of understanding of evs as most mechanics are used to servicing ice cars and in places where theres maybe not so many dealerships itll be hard to own an ev
2023-09-27,HAZC8wrWQGM,charliegb03you would have to cover a lot of miles and also be able to charge from home and would you ever save money over buying a far less expensive ice vehicle it would take years also who wants to keep a ev over a long period of time with battery cell degradation with a loss of range
2023-09-28,HAZC8wrWQGM,people should be allowed to choose people with house and drive could go for evs others could still go for ice if charging was a problem it shouldnt be decided by governments politicians environmentalists üôÑ
2023-09-28,HAZC8wrWQGM,oceanthirteen1628 this i agree with we shouldnt be forced to switch to evs only we need to have 24 different options for our vehicles hydrogen and sustainable fuels are two viable options that nobody is investing much in which is making those expensive
2023-09-27,HAZC8wrWQGM,volvo c30 is 34k so this is over priced nice review and views
2023-09-27,HAZC8wrWQGM,33k for a tiny ev no thankyou
2023-09-27,HAZC8wrWQGM,with a full length soft top or glass sun roof that amount of chic may be worth the price just about and the price aint pretty for what is an iconic namesake and a business friendly amount of makeup on a crossover it reminds me of the uninspiring and cramped ds4
2024-04-03,Z6vFfBmTXuA,oh thank you you actually acknowledged its similarity to the 500x every other reviewer hasnt mentioned it as if fiat had never ever scaled up the 500 before theyre dropping the 500x in favour of this which will undoubtedly appear in an ice form any day like the jeep avenger
2024-03-20,Z6vFfBmTXuA,i am sick to death with car manufacturers doing light interiors and no full black as an option light interiors will scuff and mark easily and damage the car is this what car makers want
2024-01-05,Z6vFfBmTXuA,fiat 600 is not a peoples car it is too expensive
2023-10-31,Z6vFfBmTXuA,bring on an abarth 600e
2023-10-17,Z6vFfBmTXuA,i love this car
2023-10-15,Z6vFfBmTXuA,i think iys a funky cool car much cooler and funkier than the jeep avenger with a nicer interior too i would have the fiat
2023-10-12,Z6vFfBmTXuA,a mistake to try and enlarge the 500 styling this car looks awful
2023-10-04,Z6vFfBmTXuA,the 500e looks premium and special this looks cheap and like a square car has had its edges rounded really not what a 500xl shouldve been the 500x proportionally is way better
2023-10-04,Z6vFfBmTXuA,great review tish üòâ
2023-10-03,Z6vFfBmTXuA,out of the two id take the jeep much nicer looking car and not so feminine
2023-10-03,Z6vFfBmTXuA,the 600e is boring and safe not at all quirky which is a problem its not affordable as it should to begin with but a fabric sunroof or all glass roof would do it good
2023-10-03,Z6vFfBmTXuA,this review gets the leggs up from meüòÖüòè
2023-10-03,Z6vFfBmTXuA,man this design is so over the top
2023-10-03,Z6vFfBmTXuA,is it impossible to design a good looking ev because ive never seen one
2023-10-03,Z6vFfBmTXuA,there are lots of dull cars of all types this one is fine
2023-10-03,Z6vFfBmTXuA,would like to see real world range tests for future car reviews claimed milage is one thing but we all know evs of all sizes usually test in ideal conditions the only range claim ive found to be pretty spot on is fm with the onewheels although they are far from perfect as a company in most other ways
2023-10-03,Z6vFfBmTXuA,just as annoying as ice cars
2023-10-03,Z6vFfBmTXuA,love the 500e not so sure about the 600e
2023-10-03,Z6vFfBmTXuA,they have to go with faster charging options if they really want these things to sell well
2023-10-03,Z6vFfBmTXuA,my next car üòä
2024-02-27,VokQJrHzBR8,i prefer fiat more than any chinese brand in terms of safety and security
2024-02-24,VokQJrHzBR8,really love the video and review of new fiat 600e and after weekend ive spend with this beautifull and fun to drive car i have to say that i really love it
2023-11-07,VokQJrHzBR8,great video but could we get these in 4k now were in 2023 plus its a channel pointing towards the future right not complaining would just he good to make use of the better picture quality which so many other youtube channels already use nicola always includes great energy into her reviews so thumbs up
2023-10-18,VokQJrHzBR8,ehm fyi electric cars do have engines üòùüòù
2023-10-17,VokQJrHzBR8,the front is so ugly üò∂ overpriced no thanks üòî
2023-10-15,VokQJrHzBR8,i always wanted them to make a 500x abarth for those abarth fans that need something more grown up hopefully a 600e abarth will be just that
2023-10-01,VokQJrHzBR8,nice enough and im a lifelong fiat fan but its yet another cynically priced car because its an ev and im a fan of evs too just because its cheaper than it doesnt make it good value still a long way off from that yet it seems good review though
2023-09-29,VokQJrHzBR8,fiat dont do any manly cars anymore this looks more a girly car with them headlights
2023-09-29,VokQJrHzBR8,my next car üòä nicola is definitely the type of person this car is aiming for
2023-09-28,VokQJrHzBR8,very nice car
2023-09-28,VokQJrHzBR8,lovely shots around turin me and the wife used to walk up that road to superga have a nice coffee in the station cafe of the funicular overlooking turin i miss my time at ital design üòû
2023-09-26,VokQJrHzBR8,i was looking forward to this review ive always liked fiats they have character and are fun the 500e is unfortunately just too small for my needs so when i learned of this 600e i was very hopeful that it could be truly great you can imagine how disappointed i was to hear how awful the steering is then thats killed it for me how can over light steering be easier to drive it would be like driving a video game something ive never managed as i lack whatever it takes to guess what the car is doing without feedback as well as this surely it is just nice to feel the car and be involved in the driving experience shame most manufacturers dont agree with me great review as always thanks
2023-09-27,VokQJrHzBR8,on all fiats there is a city button which makes the steering super light maybe they forgot to switch it off for this review
2023-09-29,VokQJrHzBR8,fabiooliveri5005 lets hope so the car has so many good points it would be a shame for it to be spoiled by one major flaw
2023-11-28,VokQJrHzBR8,i suggest yu to make a test drive and judge by yourself
2023-09-26,VokQJrHzBR8,what about a review on the nio el6 and the et5t et5 touring
2023-09-25,VokQJrHzBR8,the interior flap is annoying should not be there is cheap and can easily wrip off
2023-09-25,VokQJrHzBR8,cant wait for the hybrid to come to the uk itll sell more
2023-09-25,VokQJrHzBR8,for me this is the perfect package for a small family or a couple i currently drive a bmw i3 mainly to work and for picking up the children but this would also fit the bill renault is also getting there normalizing evs for the masses if they can charge at home that is
2023-09-25,VokQJrHzBR8,nicola is always a breath of fresh air when it comes to reviewing quirky and honest
2023-09-25,VokQJrHzBR8,i would buy chinese over european cars any day
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,amazing review great to see my hometown of turin and my childhood home being shown in this review while watching from the uk
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,totally not car related but i love you on this channel nicola
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,a refreshingly honest funny and engaging review nicola but then i expect nothing else for such a professional üòé
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,wltp range claims are the ev equivalent of something the donald might say
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,if the fiat 600e has a good higway efficiency its going to be a success other stellantis cars like jeep avenger have very bad aerodynamics which is a shame since if these cars had teslalevel efficiency they could do 300km at 130kmh which is fine for most trips and make a vehicle like this good at 360
2024-01-30,VokQJrHzBR8,well it can recharge to 80 in a short time has more range then the avenger but its not very impressive in highways not bad either
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,criticises fiat for an engine stopstart button because it doesnt have an engine but refers to the accelerator as a throttle when the car doesnt have a carburettor dear oh dear
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,254 wltp 190 real world in the summer 170 in winter take off 20 for safety to reach charging and youre left with 150 miles range thats fine if you never leave the city but youre not going to get much further without experiencing the chaotic and overpriced uk charging network good luck future purchasers
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,something even more interesting no one talks about the impact of lithium mines on the earth as if electric vehicles batteries were magically growing on trees great propaganda
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,my favourite part of this review was when looking for rear cup holders nicola lifted the rear middle headrest totally thorough reviewing
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,haha i was trying to see if there was a central arm rest to pull down which sometimes have cup holders theres method to the madness
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,nicolahume i believe you üòú
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,nice car but its a fiat
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,not my type of car but there is no way id have a chinese car over the fiat
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,i have to say its rather clear that the old fca habits are as the merger is quite recent still in full effect because even though the platform for the 600 avenger and the upcoming alfa is the old psa platform they use on the 2008 ds3 c4c4x mokka etc the ride refinement interior build quality and interior partsbin are all still fully fiat and not in the best way
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,same small battery as the rest of the stellantis lineupsame old limited real world range out of date and overpriced imo compared to competitionanother missed opportunity
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,nice car but tesla offers too many benefits more range and better software
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,rear left charging point
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,if stelantis really wants to make money with its new ev development itll stop screwingaround with trying to be sexy with them proposing ev muscle cars and make whatd be their most practical use of it changing over production of their hybrid minivans to it üòä
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,i love evs but this is too much money and doesnt seem that good either better off getting a two year old tesla model 3 for the same money
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,plus was there mention of charging speeds etc
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,i own a 500e which is a great car but the range is around 150 miles but i would exchange it for the 600e at some point
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,i recall nicola did a synthetichydrogen fuel video sometime ago probably sponsored how times change
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,ive never done a synthetichydrogen video but yes ive worked on a few things over the years
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,nicolahume shell vpower on auto express thats the video well done for being a hypocrite support the ev move or just stick to the fossil fuel dinos thnx
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,troyboy4345 ah yes that was me going to the factory and learning about the difference between regular fuel and shell v power fuel that was shot back in february and went live last week no hypocrisy here we were driving an m5 cs if youre driving a combustion engine then theres no judgement from me its good to learn about the differences in types for fuel too look after the parts in your engine go for a cleaner fuel if thats what you drive if you want to keep and care for your combustion engine because youre not ready for an ev then thats ok if youre looking for an ev then here i am to help you with that decision i have never lied about anything that i do or stand for im reviewing electric cars on an electric car channel this doesnt mean that im a hypocrite btw thanks for watchingüòâ
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,nicolahume you lack integrity as an ev reviewer for your double standards i really hope you drive an ev outside your public face this channel may question that in the future but in the mean time continue the ev reviews for people that need informing on how beneficial they are compared to ice vehicles you are either in or out for the future or stick to selling yourself with whatever you think suites as was my point re shell v power thank you for the reply to clear matters up and bring my conclusion to an end take care
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,troyboy4345 fun fact ive driven a hybrid for the last year and in a couple of days im switching to an ev like i said youll always get complete honesty from me ive reviewed evs for years as well as combustion cars i recently moved to this channel and am living an ev life but there will never be any judgement from me if an ev isnt for you budgets ability charging constraints theyre all things that people need to consider when purchasing any car thanks for watching though you may see double standards some others may see open mindedness and understanding all the best
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,nicolahume i am glad you are moving away from ice vehicles completely and starting to embrace the future my advuce to you as a new user and coming from old tech is to push and influence people and policies to move far quicker this involves setting new standards as a presenter and not pandering to fuel companies or allowing influence financially i hope your honesty and openess will recognise past involvements and you learn from them going forward welcome to the ev life feel free continue promoting the electric propulsion method and educate others rather than making excuses for old tech or people that are afraid to make the move i look forward to not seeing you in fuel additive videos unless it pays you well but thats politics and we all know how politics works stay clean
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,600e all the way or id3 never the chinese brands
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,the trouble with girls a car is just a thing that goes from a 2 b but us blokes want speed and power and fun love the videos though
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,never underestimate how fast us girls wanna go
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,jeep avenger and fiat 600e illustrate why stellantis group wants eu to impose higher tariff on chinese ev they cannot compete with mg or byd or volvo ex30 so they resort to protectionism however british consumers will continue enjoying the affordability of chinese ev since the uk is not in the eu anymore at least one benefit of brexit
2023-11-03,VokQJrHzBR8,firstly its hardly just stellantis and basically all no chinese manufacturers secondly do you not question chinese manufacturers practices i would do everything to avoid buying a chinese car the volvo you mentioned looks great yet its chinese and still expensive
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,i think i would have liked to see a hybrid version of this with the 500e the 600e just misses ticking all the boxes as is the 500e with the 500e i would have loved to see the package size of the 500 e but then with more boot space of the 600e and a 50 kwh battery pack for a guaranteed all weather all season range of 185 miles 208085 soc
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,the car looks high üòÖ
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,since its electric it should be a reliable stelantis car for a change very good aesthetic exteriorinterior are very stylish
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,well you havent seen the carwow video of the jeep avenger then p its taken down now but it broke down fours times with break issues
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,i like it though ive always loved fiat so i could be slightly biased depending on the price here in ireland i could well be tempted
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,mmmm onepedal regen to a complete stop is a necessity with evs but nicola how about the sound of the indicators
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,with all of the stlantis cars ignore the first edition and the list price look at pre reg and nearly new this and the jeep could be bargains in 2025 if you cant wait and dont need a back seat get a bargain corsa now and trade in in a couple of years some cheap motoring could be yours
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,it looks a bit odd but its cute in a way and makes me smile when i look at it i gather it also has the same battery as the emokka and e2008 im considering one of these
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,i know that the e2008 was updated recently and now features the same battery as the 600e but im not sure what battery the mokkae uses
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,judging by reviews so far the 600 and avenger have much worse quality and refinement than mokka and 2008 despite being on the same platform possibly due to almost all interior components being fca sourced i would personally avoid although i like the style more
2023-11-28,VokQJrHzBR8,shroomyescmay i suggest you to go somewhere to watch the cars you mentioned by yourself i watched a mokka andi dont think quality and refinement are better than 600e even tough ive not yet analyzed the fiat
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,prefer the styling and look of the 500xthe cost of the 600 like most electric cars is quite ludicrousliterally being taken fir a ride by most car manufacturers car manufacturer i have a cunning planüòâstick as much non essential gadgetry into our vehicles and the peasants will come runningand dont forget to rip them off
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,great review i have to say that im really flat about this car they can paint it as colourful as they like but its still pretty dull
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,it took you more than 6 mins to show the dashboard not the best thing
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,prefer the classic styling and design to the other stellantis equivalents and to the mg and byd its less rocket ship blade runner vibe than some evs seem to want to be eyes are a bit cutesy but tolerable it is classically italian design aesthetic european which i prefer laughed at your comment about its trout pout i will always see that now
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,the glovebox will be half the size in uk rhd spec its the same in the avenger and most other stalantis group
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,its not the case for fca platform cars but the avenger platform was originally developed by psa premerger and the french dont like moving the fusebox
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,love the car reasonably priced no i think european car manufacturers hear journalists say reasonably priced and then say to themselves we got away it sorry but prices have got to come down i think the eu are now grumbling that chinese ev are too cheap whats up with everyone us consumers want the prices to come down by the way i love my zoe ev and one day will replace it but not until new evs come down in price
2023-10-22,VokQJrHzBR8,would like the looks of the fiat 600e with the price of the newly announced citroen ec3 which may be around 20000 when released next year a full 12000 less than the fiat
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,its a nurdy car will sell in 10000000s a big seller for women
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,i will never buy chinese i love the fiat 600e
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,fiat avenger üòÖ
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,this car seems cheaply made
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,im not sure the cutesy look works on a bigger car it just looks podgy
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,nicola did i got it right that you said in this video that 47 mileskwh is effici√´nt for this performance if i drive non economic with strong accellerations i easily achive 52 mileskwh my car 325 bhp 420nm 0 60 under 6 s youre a bit like ginny and the avenger trying to find and say something good but this audience aint born yesterday whats going on are you afraid of no longer being invited by these legacy car manufacturers dont be afraid the automotive future is to be found in the usa china and korea stellantis cant compete with such products
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,good all rounder for the money but i wouldnt trade in my 500e because its larger sibling lacks the one pedal driving that for me is one of the major benefits of having an electric vehicle for mostly town driving
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,seems crazy to have an ev without regen that you can just dial up to preference
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,the 500 seems rare among small electric cars in having one pedal drive having experienced it i wouldnt go back to a car without it
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,glove box in the uk will probably be half the size
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,another city suv yay
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,907 rather two cabin suitcases the basic model may be an option for fans of the italian design not sure what you are getting in the top spec if you still have scratchy materials in the front not acoustic insulation and no rear seat cupholders if i would need a city car for two i would buy ora cat
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,i know small cars are becoming less and less profitable but why dont stellantis use the fiat developed 500e platform to create a range of small electric citroens and peugeots
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,because that plattform is phasing out in a year or two they will have a new plattform for small cars called the stla small which will have all their small cars on it eventually
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,peugeot 208e is a small car
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,because if you want a small car you buy a 500 not a peugeot or a citroenc
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,carlomorischi3435 the thing is that id like a 500 with the range of a id3 but i had to settle for something in the middle and got an e208
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,because its become very expensive to produce a profitable a segment vehicle and itll cost 30k electric l the 509 could pull it off as its a fashion choice the pug 108 and c1 were budget choices the panda will get a new gen but will grown to b segment size
2023-09-26,VokQJrHzBR8,teslaspectre i think we meant use the small platform they have for the e208 corsa citroen c1 etc and the smaller 500e platform for city cars like the panda a sub 208 and a new c1c2 the 500e seems to have good range and drive well so a shame that its platform isnt used further
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,nice drone shots and more colour great production nicholas presentations always good
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,the drone shots were probably provided by fiat youll see the same ones on other reviews but nichola is indeed an excellent reviewer
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,i think it has the new stallantis electric motor
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,which is more efficient
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,grey cars are for grey people and i dont mean grey haired people who deserve every respect evviva il colore
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,love the humour as always nicola oh the irony of fiat to say whats the biggest selling colour grey ok lets not make grey the lip synch seemed out but restarted it all good i think the headlights look like theyre winking i think it looks better than the avenger 5 mileskwh is incredibly good personally i think with all stellantis theyre great used buys but very expansive new purchases and not the best value for the private buyer
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,another clone fiat synonymous with italy jeep with usa made in the same factory in poland its like the id3 and cupra born made on the same production line as somebody else said just like unilever different packaging same product no innovation and still too expensive
2023-11-28,VokQJrHzBR8,have you an idea of how much it costs to design and produce different platforms and different engines for each car model all car makers do that nowadays
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,not sure why your quotient hyundai kona in the script as the small battery version only has a 39kw not like the fiats 54kw battery if you compare the 64kw kona it has at least 50miles more on the fiat 600 if your trying to impress us with this car you need to compare like for like otherwise it will seem like you are being paid by the fiat group to give a favourable review
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,exactly my thoughts hyundai is way better in bev cars
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,little gerry did you get out of bed on the wrong side paid by the fiat group a bit like saying are you working as a caretaker in a hyundai dealership fiat are part of stellantis but has a certain chic appeal is the 64w kona not more expensive hence the 39kw if you look at presenters reviews of hyundai she could actually be accused of bias
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,rather cutethe fiat is interesting too
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,yes i was thinking that especially as its a crap ev like all stellantis evs
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,enjoyed the video but what an ugly car eewww
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,pity it doesnt have one pedal driving like the 500e guess maybe the difference is that the 500 was developed prestellantis do like the turquoise piping on the 600s seats however
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,the lack of one pedal driving is a dealbreaker for me
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,electrifying chinese cars are legal roving spyware you should mention the ccps access to all of your data in every video that mentions chinese cars it is written in their laws
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,i got 65 miles per klw hour in my hyundai kona this summer and i got 201bhp i love my kona starting to get colder and i am still getting 5miles per klw hour
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,jonwragg3822 still better than a fiat
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,good video but since when was a pretty lardy bsuv a city car
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,stellantis must be the worst car conglomerate out there making incredibly cheap looking over priced cars with bad performance and average range the interiors are bland and feel awfully cheap these cars will be so heavily discounted in a couple years its going to be insane absolutely no one is going to be buying these evs for these prices
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,actually they make some of the best cars out there and with very good value for money really i dont have any idea what you are talking about
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,theallmightygodofcodwould you really cosider this vehicle at this price point with these specs daytime robbery no other words come closer
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,ive been driving a 500e for the last 20 months after owning a succession of vws and renaults the build quality is excellent compared with both my previous manufacturers which has come as something of a pleasant surprise
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,thedreamfactory6964 no because i only drive motorways 120kmh for 400km long and a ev is useless at that i would only consider a diesel however if i needed a car for driving in thee city and b roads this allong with the c4 would be at the absolute top of my list as you can not i repeat you can not get any other bon chinese car for less and with the same quality
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,briangriffiths114 i dont think stellantis owned the brand when the 500e was designed
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,ohyesitsme thanks for this john as it explains a lot ive checked the timelines and the 500e was indeed designed and production lines being prepared before the merger in 2020
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,while a speed freak might consider peugeotcitro√´n evs slow they are extremely high quality and plenty of people appreciate the designs theyre giving their platforms to the old fca brands but that doesnt mean theyll treat them right as seen here with horrible interior quality in the 600 and avenger because they just take all the parts out of the old fca partsbin i have more hope for lancia since i understand they sent peugeot designers there
2024-01-25,VokQJrHzBR8,i have comparison to new vw and new fiat after 135k km fiat had no technical issues but vw w as on guarantee repairs 17 times and after guarantee van not go 15k km without being broken
2024-01-30,VokQJrHzBR8,thedreamfactory6964slightly cheapper then the volvo ex30 a bit kore cargo space and a bit more range its a good competitor stellantis also has other incredible vehicles in the making lile the citroen ec3 peugeot e3008 ram 1500 ev the 500e and more
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,well whod have thunk it grey is the most popular colour in the uk üôÑüôà never liked the look of the 600e still dont as for that price üòÇüòÇ
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,will be a good used buy a a one year old but at that mrrp no way im sure in 6 months it will be discounted anyway cute car though
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,can nicola do all the car reviews please
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,why shouldnt the fiat have an engine an electric machine is also a motor but also a generator the difference lies in the direction of energy conversion in the generator the rotor is driven mechanically and thereby generates electrical energy in the windings of the stator with a motor the same machine is supplied with electrical energy and thereby generates mechanical energy i like the 600 and i dont need 70 or 100 kwh batteries in the car visually i havent found a chinese manufacturer that i like except for the seal from byd which is not a desirable car for me i need more ground clearance every day often on dirt roads etc thats why i would like the 600 more and the great paint palette is also a point because color in life is more important than gray on gray
2023-09-24,VokQJrHzBR8,there will soon be an suv version of the byd seal called the seal u however not everyone agrees that the seal design works on an suv make your own judgement
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,its a good little car
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,grey cars are the worst colour for a car tarmac greyblack uk skies largely greydifficult to see cars higher likelyhood of an accident well done fiat for breaking the trend having said that im not convinced i would buy one the space in the back looks a bit disapointing especially as i have a rapidly growing teenager rear space is vital
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,stellantis are turning into one of the grocery brands like unilever where they make the same product but call it something different ok maybe not quite the same product as they look different on the outside but to all intents and purpose the same lol the 600 does look quite cute though i do find it interesting that companies make city cars that are not really that good at longer journeys where people maybe need to take loads of suff i think most people want to do both short city and long journeys so not sure a city car can cut it
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,actually i think they are one of the few doing badge engineering right a mokka a c4 a 2008 an avenger or a 600 all share a lot but all are different enough to be unique and to appeal to different people but that is just my option
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,hiring a larger car for longer journeys will become more common in the future imo
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,radart6037 exactly vw usually does it right but then they completely miss it as with the city cars at least where i live although seat and skoda are super popular no one even considered the mii and the other one and just went right to a vw dealer and got an up
2023-11-28,VokQJrHzBR8,nowadays all car makers share platforms and technologies between multiple brands cars
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,really no difference from my citro√´n ec4 the shine plus was nearly 35000 yet now you can easily buy it for less than 30000 the same will happen to the jeep adventure vauxhall astra fiat 600 they will get discounted at the discounted price they are a known brand not an unknown chinese brand so i think they will sell well
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,oliverstemp9132 and you have driven the avenger and all the others before they are even available or released good for you but it still doesnt answer the issue stellantis overprice the cars then discount them later if you buy a jeep now at 40k it will drop to 35 at the showroom and second hand will be 25k loosing 15k to the early buyer screwing customers not good better just to sell it at the lower price and hold tight residual values happy customers
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,mikadavies660 lucky the avenger is already 35k then for me the avenger and astra are highlights the c4x is interesting as well ive driven some and sat with all of them i dont think anyone is being ripped off its a fact that prices change sometimes they go down and sometimes they go up
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,oliverstemp9132 my friend purchased a top spec e mokka in 2022 close to 40k now it us 18 mths old mint of course he was offered 17000 on an i4 best offer so far 17500 my ec4 was 35k and is 2022 now also 20k however fortunately for me i didnt buy it i leased it so i havent lost 15k in 15 months these stellantis cars are dropping because they are overpriced at the start then discounted later plus are not ground up bevs but petrol cars with batteries put into the gaps so they devalue quickly on another point the ec4x is actually very nice drive
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,mikadavies660 poor you i guess its but just stellantis that suffer from poor residuals all evs do because many people are not ready
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,the price is bonkers
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,if i purchased one the stanley knife would soon sort that annoying flap
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,another great review thx shame it doesnt look like the 500 a bit more but great to see the focus on efficiency it used to be all about mpg and people seem to have forgotten that with evs
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,good for fiat so sick of the sheep all going for the latest fashion colour bold colours are needed whilst i disagree with stellantis pricing their cars so high as they then offer you 5k to 10k discount later destroying the residual values look at the mokka 60 loss in 2 years just sell them at realistic prices in the first place stellantis actually design some excellent looking bevs hopefully the uaw in america wont bankrupt them with their stupid request for 40 pay increase
2023-11-28,VokQJrHzBR8,my friend the loss of value of bevs involves all the brands i think people interested in owning a bev still few compared to the total of car owners buy them or lease them even more frequently because of the original prices rest of people dont buy them simply as that
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,the only time i bought a grey car was because it was the no cost option colour
2023-09-23,VokQJrHzBR8,i suspect thats the answer the choice of colours in most new cars is very limited with only one or two options where you arent paying extra just for the colour most cars sold doesnt necessarily tell you much about popularity since its effectively not a free choice
2023-09-26,VokQJrHzBR8,which is why anyone buys anything the most popular colour in the uk is always the one most people offer free
2024-05-11,ejT6GwY6cSY,i love a smooth tuned brake pedal for regen in normal driving there the car is just rolling free when im of the pedal and its no reason for any braking and i think its more impressing with the manufacturer that have managed to tune the regen on the brake pedal such as you dont understand that you always use regen braking if you are not panic breaking of course drivers are different but as a passenger i dont like that my head are rolling for unnecessarry regenbraking because the driver dont have steady right foot i suppose that everybody now know that one pedal driving came because tesla didnt manage so smooth regen braking on the brake pedal as they wanted and found it easier with tuning for a one pedal driving and its ofcourse ok for people who like it and can drive smooth with this but the driving style i have experienced wasnt comfortable for me as passenger have a smooth driveüòä
2024-04-12,ejT6GwY6cSY,you really need to say how tall you are in feet or metres when talking about the leg and head room in the seats unusually tall does not give much useful info
2024-02-15,ejT6GwY6cSY,beautiful car with a high value ev package well done fiat
2024-02-15,ejT6GwY6cSY,when will other car manufacturers in the us start making comparable sized all electric cars an excellent size for all the one and two person families plus those with two small children which now are not well served the continued use of buttons and knobs for critical controls was the correct choice diddling with multiple menus is hazardous in all situations not sure the the lack of onepedal driving is such a big detraction reputation of quality and reliability is critical
2024-02-13,ejT6GwY6cSY,why are most evs suvs
2024-01-10,ejT6GwY6cSY,absolutely cool looking car job well done by fiat
2023-12-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,i agree with you jack i have a 500e with one pedal driving and would want it in the 600e if fiat do not introduce it in later cars then i would not consider buying it
2023-12-08,ejT6GwY6cSY,problem with all car reviews is the presenter cant say anything really negative otherwise he wont get anymore expense paid junkets
2023-12-04,ejT6GwY6cSY,i turned off when i heard the price 33k sorry
2023-11-29,ejT6GwY6cSY,4 seat family car are we back in the days of the ford anglia
2023-11-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,people should see an empty gas tank and an ev battery side by side and then answer why the other one is more expensive one has no energy in it just a plastic box and the other one all the energy it ever needs just add the electricity every now and then
2023-11-24,ejT6GwY6cSY,any ev that doesnt at least have the option for full one pedal driving is an instant hard no for me dealbreaker shame
2023-11-22,ejT6GwY6cSY,in europe 50 people cant afford new car not even a cheapest
2023-11-19,ejT6GwY6cSY,for most of us some sucker has to pay full wack and lose 20 for the rest to be able to buy cars these days mostly fleet or ex car hire for a private buyer to spend 30k on a new car they definitely have way more money than sense one year old is probably the sweet spot
2023-11-14,ejT6GwY6cSY,is no one getting it the biggest problem with evs is the cost it is so so much more like an average of 10 grand more for the ev versus the ice car on any given makemodel in the uk 10 thousand pounds 10000 and this car is the same over 10000 more than i paid for my ice car and my car is fitted with every conceivable toy a 10000 price difference means the ice car owner is already better off 10 grand buys you well over 3500 gallons of diesel at current uk prices so the price difference means that i effectively have 3500 gal of free fossil fuel compared to owning this ev üòÇ so it really doesnt matter how good the range improvements become on an exploding vehicle or how cheap is to charge owning my ice car means i effectively have 3500 gallons of free fuel and 3500 gal at the 55mpg average i do is 77000 miles that means my ice car is cheaper to ownrun for around 6 years at which time this ev might start to claw some ground back until it needs a new battery in another 3 years and the ev owner is another 10000 out of pocket 77000 miles do you realise that means my ice car can travel three times around the entire circumference of the planet and i am still better off in the first year than if i purchased this exploding vehicle and simply left is sitting in the driveway for the same year
2023-11-12,ejT6GwY6cSY,serious question why do people want an electric boot
2023-11-02,ejT6GwY6cSY,so this is the fiat version of the citroen ec3 and its 50 more expensive because it has 30 more range
2023-10-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,what peugeot would you like would you like a peugeot made by fiat a peugeot made by vauxhall or a peugeot made by jeep all of these are pathetic reskins of peugeots the peugeot 2008 and vauxhall mokka are great modern cars so why would you want to buy a cheesy rebadge
2023-10-22,ejT6GwY6cSY,one pedal driving is overrated i drive a e208 in b mode and i think stellantis got it just ride at least with my drive style of just keeping the flow
2023-10-22,ejT6GwY6cSY,one pedal driving is shifty and stupid tho the unintuitive deceleration ruins a trip if you want it it should be an option but never imposed as the default for those who hate it
2023-10-21,ejT6GwY6cSY,fully charged is an industry backed propaganda organisation desperately trying to boost the flagging sales of evs
2023-10-20,ejT6GwY6cSY,another ev the us wont be seeing anytime soon i know were not the friendliest market but this is a perfectly affordable ev that we desperately need and that im sure plenty of the fiat heads here in the us would drive off the lot immediately
2023-10-17,ejT6GwY6cSY,the fiat 600 is no rocket science it is from the big family from stellantis and in very close family with the cars opel corsa opel mokka ds 3 crossback peugeot 208 ii peugeot 2008 ii and jeep avenger so no revolution i would take the jeep avenger 4x4
2023-10-16,ejT6GwY6cSY,cheap at 33000 you are taking the piss right cheap is well under 20000 if governments were really adamant about everyone switching to evs asap they would work with car manufacturers to get the cost of these things down so that theyre actually cheaper to buy than combustion engine cars instead we have a situation now where only the upper middle class and the rich can realistically afford an ev with a usable range and a house where they can actually install their own charge point but i suppose itll open up a few of those lanes on the motorway if the plebs are forced to take the electric bus
2023-10-15,ejT6GwY6cSY,poor üòÆ interior üòÆ design
2023-10-13,ejT6GwY6cSY,i love that this is small and not the oversized vehicles that most evs are
2023-10-13,ejT6GwY6cSY,ive just read an article where it says that the insurance for evs went up by 60940 because they are very expensive to fix and catch fire is it true
2023-11-25,ejT6GwY6cSY,andreiarama8745 in a year that saw double digit inflation where supply chains for parts across the world have been stretched to breaking point and trained ev technicians have been in short supply no i consider its a good outcome i just look forward to future years when ev insurance falls back to normal level and there is nothing but the joy of bulletproof reliability minimal servicing and maintenance and rock bottom running costs
2023-11-25,ejT6GwY6cSY,sailingoctopus1 supply chain is already fixed why do you need a lot of trained ev technicians for cars with minimal servicing and maintenance and bulletproof reliability and btw the insurance costs a lot because when the battery pack is damaged its cheaper to scrap the car then fix it it doesnt matter how good of a technician you are i know someone that spend 60k to fix his model s that same damage in a similary damaged s class or 7 series would cost less than 20k and be fixed in weeks not months
2023-10-13,ejT6GwY6cSY,still way too expensive stalantis also have the corsair e at 32 for the no frills base model these small cars should be mid 20k
2023-10-12,ejT6GwY6cSY,just noticed that the startstop button says engine startstop on it lol
2023-10-12,ejT6GwY6cSY,well maybe finally we acknowledge that cars are a mega expensive terrifyingly bad use of money and resources
2023-10-11,ejT6GwY6cSY,any car above 5k is expensive ridiculous that even renault twizzies even are still going for 610k
2023-10-10,ejT6GwY6cSY,why are you brits still using miles feet and inches werent you supposed to be using metric
2023-10-10,ejT6GwY6cSY,its about 5x the price of previous generation of 600 adjusted for inflation twice as heavy 80 cm longer 30 cm wider and also a crossover now its not a 600 anymore imo
2023-10-10,ejT6GwY6cSY,fiat mini ev for two four seater models with average range 150 miles per charge will be desirable for indian roads price should be competitive
2023-10-10,ejT6GwY6cSY,waiting for this mini ev to be lunch in india reasonable price with ac good quality battery range will be in high demand
2023-10-09,ejT6GwY6cSY,to put price in perspective use same trim and spec ice youll see there not much less and will never cut on running cost or cut emissions
2023-10-09,ejT6GwY6cSY,the small simple electric car weve been waiting for was surely the 500e except it was rubbish you seem to be trying really hard to make the car sound small when its blatantly obvious it isnt also dont pretend the materials are of good quality for the price when you have some premium option which makes it cost way more than the advertised 37k disingenuous the reason it doesnt have single pedal driving is cos the motor is such low power which you seem to be simultaneously complimenting it for
2023-10-09,ejT6GwY6cSY,a shame that this 600 is not available with just a regular hybrid enginedrivetrain
2023-10-09,ejT6GwY6cSY,chick car w the eyelids and eye lashes
2023-10-08,ejT6GwY6cSY,that rear seat thought so well thought out
2023-10-07,ejT6GwY6cSY,one pedal driving some like it some dont been driving evs for 6years and never fell in love with it gliding is much easier and adaptive cruise control is best
2023-10-07,ejT6GwY6cSY,please dont use words so easily this car isnt cheap
2023-10-07,ejT6GwY6cSY,this isnt a strip show you dont need to build anticipation start with the price and specs
2023-10-06,ejT6GwY6cSY,38000 just pay 5000 more and you get a tesla model 3 with 20 more range 43000 in germany and all the new features noise insulated glass for all windows improved interior materials screen for rear passengers ambient light etc and of course the supercharger network and potential for full self driving sorry but the value you get for your money with the tesla is just so much better
2023-10-06,ejT6GwY6cSY,stellantis were recently offering ice mokka not a coffee for 6500 off a starting price of 25k brand new similar size efficiency etc and with a 14k difference in price the biggest reason people cant switch to ev yet
2023-10-05,ejT6GwY6cSY,a affordable is the fiat 600 actually also when one looks at the cost of ownership the 10kwh100km is the most promising bit for me as a smart ed owner from 2012 this is the car to watch
2023-10-05,ejT6GwY6cSY,turn off quickly to prices squander like this electric aint green we still got to make the electric 33000 when your battery wont stand up any more the pills a bit hard to swallow another 15000 or so to get you up on the road again gives you something to contemplate while you have to wait in the cold light of day top of the alps for a prick up what the hell use is it guys
2023-10-05,ejT6GwY6cSY,please gary dont worry about it its fine stick to whatever it is you drive now dont be triggered by electric cars yes they are better last longer cost less to run will take over the entire car fleet but it will takes a long time you are fine keep buying expensive imported fossil fuel and burning it once
2023-10-05,ejT6GwY6cSY,its affordable foreveryone that matters
2023-10-04,ejT6GwY6cSY,interesting addition to ev choice thanks jack
2023-10-04,ejT6GwY6cSY,would be nice if you reviewed the car without the cringey shtick üò¨
2023-10-04,ejT6GwY6cSY,lack of acceleration also means that it will be using mechanical brakes more which might be why they opted to exclude one pedal driving
2023-10-03,ejT6GwY6cSY,another great review from captain scarlett üòÜ
2023-10-03,ejT6GwY6cSY,got to hand it to fiat its a beaut i remember the strada when it was released in the 1970s revolutionary design classless progressive and orange
2023-10-03,ejT6GwY6cSY,let me know when there is a decent 4 seat ev for under 15k thanks
2023-10-03,ejT6GwY6cSY,go to autotrader in the uk where there are currently 180000 second hand electric cars many well within that price bracket thanks
2023-10-03,ejT6GwY6cSY,no it is not we were waiting for a small simple and cheap car
2023-10-03,ejT6GwY6cSY,hey when can we expect a review of the ex30 volvo
2023-10-03,ejT6GwY6cSY,electric cars never and certainly not in this climate with a lot of rain i prefer a jeep you dont have to have a brain to understand meüòÇ
2023-10-03,ejT6GwY6cSY,did you know that in the middle east a d segment large family car costs only 10k usd new yes the coffina on wheels also known as iranian cars are 10k usd so how can this 30k gbp car be called cheap byd is cheap xiaopeng is reasonably priced wuling is cheap mg is cheap not this
2023-10-02,ejT6GwY6cSY,its too much money not that long ago 2007 to be exact i bought a brand new car for 4600 in 2015 i bought a brand new citroen c3 for 8000 and it wasnt the cheapest available there is no way i could even contemplate paying 33000 for whats effectively the same type of car i know inflation has made a difference to to price of things but this is really trying it on
2023-10-02,ejT6GwY6cSY,jack please have someone of normal size ie 57 tall stand alongside vehicles you test you make every car look as low as a lotus europa the 1970s era ones not the taller later ones if we could get the fiat 600 in the usa id buy one
2023-10-02,ejT6GwY6cSY,still a mountainous gyr of plastic inside when is somebody going to get really serious about efficiency people are using the early small electrics for commuting and shopping ieoneup driving so why not make the seats other than drivers easily removable and storable ditch glass for the windows substitute polycarbonate reducing daily carry weight at a stroke and making more space for shopping make passenger seats an option at purchase as far as price is concerned suprised nobodies come up with a group membership purchase plan to help get bulk discounts from the manufacturers like the armed services scheme local dealers usually cant touch the discount offered on that scheme
2023-10-01,ejT6GwY6cSY,err not affordable and the range is still poor
2023-10-01,ejT6GwY6cSY,its not really long rangeabout 200 miles max
2023-10-01,ejT6GwY6cSY,beautiful car too bad its electric
2023-09-30,ejT6GwY6cSY,jack doesnt dislike any electric car no matter how shitty irl it is thats just keeping the car companies happy to get invitations for as many new lauches in fancy locations as possible this is not car journalism when you are appreciating every car and not being objective the reviews from electric car reviewers are becoming so over the top positive that they have lost any objectivity i have stopped watching the videos and have unsubbed these channels utter rubbish
2023-10-03,ejT6GwY6cSY,i stay subbed not to know their opinions but just to know how the cars are developing stellantis is as trash as usual but where are the cool chinese cars with elliot i am going to sub to wheelsboy because elliot has disappeared
2023-09-30,ejT6GwY6cSY,is it just me or are many fiat dealers in uk closing down
2023-09-30,ejT6GwY6cSY,thirty three thousand pounds cheap as a daily commute vehicle i think not how many people actually pay cash for a new car most i expect get it on a loanlease sooner people realise how bad electric cars are in terms of manufacturer longevity and resale the better for all of us good vid just shame about the product you push
2023-09-30,ejT6GwY6cSY,nice colour but otherwise an expensive problem like all evs
2023-09-30,ejT6GwY6cSY,one pedal driving sucks give me a brake pedal every time
2023-09-29,ejT6GwY6cSY,i hate grey cars with a passion so good on fiat for that for some reason stellantis sticks to 1 motor and 1 battery for all their electric cars until the new e3008 is out so 156hp and 51kwh is the same in the last versions of the peugeot e208 e2008 opel corsa opel mokka ds3 crossback c4 jeep avenger
2023-09-29,ejT6GwY6cSY,fiat fix it again tony was plagued with reliable issues electrical transmission and engine in its ice vehicles
2023-09-29,ejT6GwY6cSY,its got eyelashes like penelope pitstops car
2023-09-29,ejT6GwY6cSY,physical buttons wouldnt buy a car without it
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,i stopped bothering to watch at the mention of the price still not realistic and frankly still a bit of a pss take no matter how good it might be
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,i do hope evs actually become cheap and affordable before i die ha watcher of your videos with great interest even though i will never be able to afford an ev anytime soon still good to know where things are going maybe one of these used in 10 years im not sure how automakers can justify asking for essentially the down payment on a house for just a basic car
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,i like churin as a city
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,the headlamps firmly position this as a girls car
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,why little red car mad
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,an italian car that cant leak oil is a concept whose time has come
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,stopped watching when you suggested that one pedal driving might ever be a desirable thing you should not be allowed in a car i am so glad i will die soon so i dont have to live in your world now that i think of it i am also grateful that i dont feel so strongly about other things like race or religion i would be a truly awful person if i did phew
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,wow love the style its a fiat is it reliable
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,it always kills me to see giant suvs with ridiculous acceleration if you ever tried to drive one of those at full potential youd roll over at the first corner its just marketing
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,would rather have 1 year old tesla model 3 which better in every way and has its own fast reliable cheap charging network
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,lovely car but why oooooo why is there no 1 pedal drive
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,is the imperial human language worst statement ever
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,i think evs ned a new paradigm for drive selection a row of plastic buttons doesnt cut it
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,all humans use metrics but british people and some of their past colonies are struggling with inches miles and the like üòÇ english and metrics are the standards worldwide
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,totally unaffordable for most and good luck in achieving anything close to 250 miles in practice especially in winter manufacturers and polititicians live in a parallel universe
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,ok im out im officially done with cars and fully charged im all about electric and renewables and have loved your work to date but didnt make it to the end here aud62000 for a small car and im supposed to think that is affordable i may as well be aspiring to the latest bugatti i am simply not ever gonna be in the demographic to do the right thing car wise unless it is to simply never own another in my life ill not likely ever manage a decent ebike not your fault of course but it renders your content irrelevant to me subscription done and all good bye
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,rear charging port check nonintrusive central screen and infrontofdriver speed etc display check almost nonexistant regen onepedal driving rsssp
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,the headlights look like a teenage girls eyes replete with mascara flick no thanks
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,i love you jack and i love the fully charged show but i have to second what others have already said and ive lost interest in watching the rest of this episode after you called this 30k car an affordable one folk like labels cheap and affordable mean something the only car ive seen that could be considered cheap affordable was dacia 8k new we need an ev in this price range to then call it cheap everything up from 20k new is loan affordable if you like to borrow funds for your cars üòä
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,pro tip for the producers of the show please watch your videos on a sound system with a proper subwoofer before publishing it then youd notice the insane lowfrequency rumble during the incar driving shots please consider a 50 to 80 hz highpass filter in the future to get rid of that thank you üòä
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,well if this is the start of the models from stellantis they will be out of business in 15 years time utter crap
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,moses_vii i know italy and fiat dont have a good rep with electrics
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,great review as always and good to see you getting lost as usual üòâyour a good sport for leaving that in i do share others frustrations about 30k cars being called cheap although appreciate its all relative i think the real concern is that evs are being used to recalibrate car prices skyward and whens theres nothing but electric cars to buy in a few tears time its going to make things really hard for many drivers especially those of us reliant on the used market where inevitably prices will be higher too plus if the price of battery grade lithium keeps rising with demand its very difficult to see a time when evs will ever get cheaper to produce
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,i was definitely surprised when you said it was that much i was expecting mid 20k based on using the word cheap when i bought a new renault zoe in 2016 it was closer to half of that price even if you didnt do the battery rental option it was still way less than any ev today i do really appreciate the efficiency of this car though but then how much more efficient would it be if it wasnt raised up more than a standard small hatchback
2023-10-07,ejT6GwY6cSY,nickclarkuk if your wages have gone up in line with inflation which if i was still working at the same job i was then im sure it wouldnt have along with most other low wage workers public or private sector so youd be totally priced out of any new cars as well as most other things in life its hardly surprising how many people went from relatively comfortable to destitute everything went up significantly for them except wages
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,love the car reasonably priced no i think european car manufacturers hear journalists say reasonably priced and then say to themselves we got away it sorry but prices have got to come down i think the eu are now grumbling that chinese ev are too cheap whats up with everyone us consumers want the prices to come down by the way i love my zoe ev and one day will replace it but not until new evs come down in price please please auto journalists tell ev car manufacturers what potential customers are thinking and ask them what they intend to do about high prices
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,87 kwh per 100 km is just bonkers anything less than 15 kwh100 km is still good in my mind very impressive
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,liters come on fully charged spell things correctly
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,those headlamps make me think of the ladycars from pixars cars
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,very impressed with the fait 600 and your commentary as well as the videography but what iyou missed is how does one recharge and how long does that take
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,250 miles wltp range means real world will be around 160 miles fuk that
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,when will you get someone other than jack to do these reviews
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,love your reviews across the board i would love to see additional information regarding the batteries though when you tell us what the battery size is it would also be great to know what the underlying battery chemistry is such as lfp or nmc thanks
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,and what might be the euroncap test results for this car
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,um efficiency is definitely not underprioritized in evs
2023-09-30,ejT6GwY6cSY,33000 pounds is one heavy car what the frunk
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,more efficient evs love this
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,me i am keeping diesel until 2035 theres no need to rush i just bought a citroen c4 grand picasso 16hdi for less than 5k excellent on diesel full tank 85 and 750 miles
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,is there a dog mode i dont understand how so many evs dont do it
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,33k for the entry price what for that little thing get real
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,cheap are you mentally challenged unless this is 25000 euro in top trim you cannot call this cheap for what it offers its severely overpriced
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,9kw100 km is insane a 100 kwh battery would get this further then 1000km if i drive my model y as efficient as possible it still consumes 13kw100 km and thats considered efficient but still its too expensive it 41k vs 44k on the model y you get so much more car for that extra 3k plus supercharger network
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,even the cobblestones have a tasteful design italy
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,maybe they can software update the regen to a more aggressive one pedal driving level
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,it lacks happiness and delight as you mentioned in micro car its small but it leave a smile on your face everytime you see it
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,kwh100k in human language is far more common than mileskwh around the world i know this is a mainly a uk channel but i think you aim for a global audience so keep that in mind an overlay with kwh100k would be appreciated in other videos
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,what many peoples comments are saying is that evs are not cheap and i agree i bought my ev car in march 2022 and the same car now in 2023 is more than 2000 more for me it was affordable only because of the very generous 12000 grant including scrapping a 10year old ice car which is given here in malta and which brought the price to roughly 25000 so i agree that to say that the 600 is cheap is like saying that a porsche taycan is cheap when compared to a bugatti hypercar
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,thats about the same price as a model 3 with less passenger space storage space horse power and range or if you will to lose a few miles on a zippier car get a chevy bolt and save up to 15k when they shave off at least 10k from the price then maybe thatll be affordable
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,love the looks and love the colour great shade of red i always said the larger 500s should have been called 600 and this looks like fiat have heard me at last nice offering but still to expensive for me
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,once again the hyundai kona is still the cheapest ev you can buy with over 200mile range 33000 usd for 64kwh 260m range
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,i want a b segment electric carthat isnt compromised by needing to fit a gearbox and all that old architecture i got all excited but left disapointed
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,please guys get your hands on the currently just unveiled production ev sportscar the sc01 we want to know more
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,6 miles per kwh at say 10p per kwh on nighttime tariff thats 17p per mile of course people shouting scam would use rapid charger prices vs the cheapest petrol they can find so at say 79p per kwh rapid charger thats 13p per mile compared to petrol at say 155 per litre at 60 mpg yeah sure gives around 116p a mile in reality if people are using rapid chargers they would also be filling up at motorway services at 175 per litre they would maybe get 40mpg real world giving them 196p per mile but its a scam in their words
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,hydrogen powered vehicles are the way forward
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,if our government were reasonable and not in hock to the oil burning industries they would tax them for killing 30000 people a year with their pollution an extra five grand on top of an ice car would even things up a bit
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,jack i was have a sweat watching you reverse down that lane i rather you than me
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,no its not the ev we all have been waiting for but at least it in the right direction all new cars are expensive including ice ones but a price point under 30k for a urban family runabout would be nice by the way well done jack
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,you can eulogise over this car all you like but compared to an alternative ice car it is a very expensive small car with an abysmal range slow refuelling time and with a battery that is reducing in range and capacity because of dendrite formation over time and use cycles from the moment it is built just like all the rest
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,you gotta love bs martketing stunts i went on fiats website you absolutely can still order a grey car from them and the 154hp engine is the same output as the electric abarth so in this car its modest in the abarth its a hot hatch but despite all that this is exactly the kind of car that we need much more of ie a normal small family hatchback a good all rounder that can do all the normal day to day things that normal people use cars for without costing as much as a small house
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,under powered and too expensive add to that stellantis build quality i think ill pass if you want small then go for the 500e if you want anything else then gwm byd or mg
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,re the one pedal driving i think psa stellantis when they designed the ecmp platform elected to play it safe for those making that first move from ice to ev i believe that the stla medium platform as revealed with the new e3008 which you are yet to review does have selective regen through padles on the steering wheel
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,im looking at an older second hand ev it is a fair bit more expensive than similar petrol cars talking of the 2012 imiev üòÖ but of course if you pay on a loan and calculate weekly then consider that weekly repayment wont involve petrol costs which is quite expensive at the moment
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,borrowing money is a bad idea buy a cheaper car even a mortgage is bad either cash or stay in rent debt can catch people in crises
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,gives me a degree of hope for when they introduce a hopefully 4x4 electric panda which is the car im waiting for my 2008 panda cross is starting to feel very long in the tooth
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,87 kwh 100 km 71 miles kwh
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,love it i have only 3 grinds with it i hope they will have 3 options to ad wireless android auto an electric to open glass sunroof and cooled seats for more efficiency thanks for making me dizzy with reversing lol nono great job as always take care
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,not small small is a 500 size car
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,oh my god citroen tried cars with eyebrows about a decade ago and thankfully it died but now its back and its winking at me
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,im waiting to see something better than this what would that mkw figure be in the uk i wonder if jack ever drove the original hyundai ioniq ive had mine for almost seven years and im still averaging 150 miles per 28kw charge 536 mkw using milton keynes national speed limit roads
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,i expect the fiat 500e will be discontinued within a year18months in favour of this new 600e just like most smaller cars from other manufacturers on the face of it the 600e seems a sensible alternative as far as evs go
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,how is 30k cheapthat is nz 60k who buys new cars with massive depreciation biggest problem with italian cars is the electricsaside from build quality etcso how can their bevs fair any better quite like the look thoughthe headlights should have eyebrows
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,stick to metric gb has to grow up sometime
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,hey jack love your work can you tell the car makers we want cheap entry level electric cars
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,first of all for european streets and especially italy its not a small car for its dimensions a vw up is a small car a fiat panda a fiat 500 or a mitsubishi space star or hyundai i10 or toyota yaris this car is renault captur sizenissan quashqai so a big crossover not suitable for europes congested narrow city streets it will in the usa canada definitely
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,this is a 2seater car no need to pretend about it
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,whats the battery chemistry what kind of battery thermal management does it have what wil the battery warranty be these three questions whilst a bit dull are the most important factors in buying an ev
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,seemingly unpopular opinion one pedal driving is kindaawful
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,i lost interest after i found the price of it 32995 doesnt strike me as affordable for a small car at all however good efficient speedy or pretty it is makes me wonder who buys these cars what we need is a henry ford herbert austin or andr√© citro√´n for the 21st century to design and build affordable basic electric cars for the masses
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,my oh my affordable you say how big is your pay packet we all know what the majority of people want is sub 20k cars but when will that happen god only knows teslas sub 20k car seems no further forward despite all the hype but im pretty confident provided they keep to their promises will have my patronage 100
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,just bought a 1 year old vivaro e life elite for 24k im getting nearly 3miles per kw this is the best car ive ever had i love electric cars
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,why cant any electric car build a decent dash heres an ipad and heres some glue
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,whos gonna be able to afford that all those kids digging in the mines the poisoning and devastation to the environment stop building new cars and just keep the old ones in good repair the carbon is so much less than building new its all about money and profit nothing else and your falling for it 33000 use to get you a house
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,impressive price price low affordable you say for a 30000 plus car very very small percentage of people would utter such nonsense
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,interesting review the new stellantis drivetrain appears to be offering efficiency on a par with the late lamented hyundai ionic that was discontinued a few years ago but the lack of onepedal driving is dealbreaker for me otherwise i would consider trading in my 500e for the 600e in a few years time just to gain the improved efficiency and range
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,i have an ionic classic 28kwh easily get 55mplkw excellent internal space and huge boot the one pedal selectable regen is a dream if they squeezed 50kwh battery in it it would be the electric car for the masses only dissapoint is the resale value has fallen off a cliff but then ive no plans to replace it
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,online calculator says 87kwh100km 71mikwh
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,this should be headline news as only the discontinued hyundai ionic could match this kind of efficiency that is lacking in most evs as a comparison my 500e driven in range mode with a very light foot would be lucky to get more than 5 miles per kwh in similar driving conditions
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,great review and a nice car but electric cars are expensive ive just bought a bmw 118i m sport auto metallic privacy glass for 32000 even cheaper than an astra or peugeot 308gt other cars i was looking at trouble is everybody thinks they are premium but apart from history build quality comes customer service and retailer ambience and care and that is where many brands will come unstuck after 30 years in the car industry and owning many brands bmw service in my experience trumps everybody although lexus also do a fine job
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,i never accidentally stress out passengers with acceleration in any car accidentally is doing the work there
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,great maths jack and a great review as well
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,still too expensive for me to go electric
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,the frontend looks pretty feminine to my eyes probably because of the painted upper eyelids and the eyelashes through and to the side of the headlamps üòÖ not bad in any way but just the impression i get and a good looking family city car in any case
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,bumpy roads thailand has some real shock absorber testers eventhough the roads are not cobble they might as well be still far too expensive for a noddy big ears car the 51kw battery is nmc so the 8010 rule applies thus only occasional use can be made of the 250 mile max range which being a wltp should be reduced by 15 for practical purposes thus max range could be as little as 151 miles before another top up ie a 35 min stop every 2 hours on the autopista sorry but im not paying 33k for that
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,very nice perfect size almost as expensive as a tesla model 3 with twice the power
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,love your reviews jack great job there is a dirth of evs where i amso its great to see whats happening in the rest of the world
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,car worth 13 of the price at which it is sold if you buy it youd better not reproduce
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,1105 its damn near 7 actually also uk please get with the program metric is where its at
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,durability reliability and life cycle costs battery monitoring system and rapid charging capabilities
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,price is too high for that small car goodby
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,i did an impression of jack when venturing in to the byd dolphin and set the front seat at my driving position and then jumped in the back that car i found a bit the reverse of this one with plenty of leg room but head room compromised by the sunroof i think it is also cheaper than the fiat 600üòä
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,but we dont have the electrical infrastructure to cope with the power demands besides how would i charge an ev from the 5th floorüòÇüòÇ
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,regarding efficiency electricity aint cheap at many nonat home charging locations
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,youre still the only one that doesnt understand kwh100km its how we measure gas milage too with litres100km
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,this is exactly the kind of car canada needs unfortunately it would probably sell for 50000cad which would be out of reach for 75 of our population the rich keep getting richer and the middleand even the upper middle class for that matterkeeps getting smaller and starting to fall behind with the rest of us poor saps what really sucks is the rich are the only people that can afford evs and they get to enjoy the provincial and federal government rebateswhere available when they finally sell them after 2 or 3 years because they always like to drive something new they dont pass along the savings that they enjoyed so they are still expensive still somewhat rare because of supply issues and the subsequent owners that buy it used are still overpaying for what they are getting also with the pandemic and the new carbon tax that just came into effect a few months ago the cost of gasoline has almost doubled in price from just 5 years ago as the poor people are forced to continue to use ice cars they are now paying several thousand more per year just in gas and the poor keep getting poorer üò• its just not fair
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,all wheel drive
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,really have to laugh how car review these days think 30k is cheap bloody hell they are not in the real world if families struggling to keep yp with ever rising costswho would give 30 k for one of these üôÑüôÑüôÑ
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,good review im missing the charging speed though
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,there are national car
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,the size pleasantly reminds me of the bolt ev amperae discontinued being almost the same length which is a woefully underserved size for full range evs too bad it doesnt have proper onepedal driving thats a dealbreaker for me its really clear how much a difference a bespoke ev architecture makes though in the bolt the rear seat is very usable and would likely pass the jack test im 62 and fit behind myself without issue and it has more like 470l of trunk space behind the rear seats a big step up from the 360l mentioned here
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,we need to know the battery mnf chemistry and whats under the bonnet please
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,seriously 33000 for the entry level look start holding the car manufacturers to account for the ridiculous prices theyre charging and stop justifying them vehicle manufacturers can get the price of evs down to 20000 or less but typical of the industry theyre simply being greedy
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,i wish the us would get a car like this as opposed to the gargantuan evs we are resigned to
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,i take it you dont get the bolt euv across the pond more real world range more performance more interior space lower price
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,could have saved a couple of hundred quid doing away with that stupid boot auto opening honestly is really that hard to open it yourself
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,hold on jack isnt this fiat made in china
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,how the world has changed in 2019 33k would have bought you a very nice nearly new bmw 520d m sport in 2023 it buys you a near bottom of the range fiat sorry its going to take a while for me to get my head around this progress
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,looks like an electrified 500x no one ever seems to mention that
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,when you dont pay for it mate you forget 30k is bloody expensive i dont care if it makes tea even when do you get it masses of the folk who may like to save the planet cant afford 30k
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,forgive me but i dont know of a single individual who has been waiting for an electric vehicle of any shape or form here in america the govt has decided to subsidize the sales of evs to the wealthy with taxpayer monies via tax breaks in effect lets double the burden of the already stretched middle and lower income earners by subsidizing vehicles they neither want or can afford its brilliant squint your eyes if you have to
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,just a bit bigger than my old mazda 2 reckon ill need to keep an eye on fiat into the next year or so
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,great styling except for those headlights being a bit twee eyes with lashes 1029 not a fan of anthropomorphising cars hopefully not a fiat trend we see in line with their no grey to be fair it only really hit me at that time mark but boy did i see it
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,hey jack most people who have never driven an electric car have never even driven an automatic car one pedal driving for the new to auto will be a step too far for most you need to remember not all of those watching will be as expertly experienced as yourself
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,yawnwhat a bore this car
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,33k pounnds or if a basic 1 to 1 with aud price which it never is import tax etc 62k aud byd atto 3 long range is 53k and thats also not cheap sorry fully charged but your concept of cheap is way off the mark honestly love the show but 33k pounds isnt cheap
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,with this pricerange we open de door for chinese crap like byd and we wont have any european car industry left on a few years mark my words
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,im just thinking about what cool fast cars i can buy for 20k nope none of them are battery cars
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the fiat goo it says goo everywhere
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,9kwh100km wow thats really awesome
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,may i ask how tall you are sir you seemed a bit outsized for the vehicle
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,how is it that car brands are advertising all their products as family cars while there are so many people without children who dare i say have far fewer expenses and more time at their hands to go on weekend trip with a two seater or a small twodoored car with four seats or two seats and a lot of space
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,those seats are gross great to see high efficiency and reasonable battery size
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,this is the first automotive journalist that i head say the was on stla medium even stellantis said the first car on that platform hasnt come out yet so did he use the wrong graphic which shows the stla medium platform
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,in other words a gas car with batteries chucked in instead half baked no thanks
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,cheapest does not make anything affordable 1015k could be considered affordable to a family of two incomes in a small house as that family are going to need an accessible garage to shelter and charge this vehicle they will need to upgrade their home too electric vehicles only make sense if you can afford the lifestyle most people cant
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,what happened to price parity with ice cars i think the ev industry is shooting itself in the foot theres lies spread by the fossil fuel industry that have taken root at the highest levels of government and consumers are the ones footing the bill for action on climate change the big polluters should be forced to pay for the change this all stinks to high heaven id like to buy a regular family sized car with decent range and economy that doesnt cost three times what the equivalent ice vehicle costs it doesnt matter if the running costs are cheaper and you can power your house because these savings are minimal and wont recoup the money you sink into it
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,long range 400 km thats still short range and like everyone else says 10000 is cheap 30000 expensive for 400 km range
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the hybrid version is substantially cheaper with an mpg high enough that the lifetime cost of ownership is lower than many large inefficient evs
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,tesla might be to blame we seem to have entered a regime where owning an ev means you have to be able to trash ferraris with your acceleration why if the toyota corolla is one of the best selling cars of all time you would think some auto industry corporate megabrain would tell his team we need a corolla class ev nonoffensive appearance modest power cheap to run and repair practical layout heaps of interior space at a reachable price this car is one of the few along with the mg4 that even comes close to that just thinking our neighbours 2014 corolla has rear seat legroom that makes our 3series bmw feel cramped
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,sub 10 kwh100km is actually _really_ impressive particularly for a multi energy ie non bespoke ev platform
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,claimed efficiency is 151 kwh100 km and i cant see any level of careful driving going far below that i think jack must have got his numbers wrong
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,yeah looks like mad efficiency fiats screen was showing 87 kwh100 km in the video that would be about 360 mile range from 51kwh battery
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,mranwarsmithprobably because he was driving at low speeds and in nice weather
2023-09-29,ejT6GwY6cSY,pjryedefinitely seems wrong tesla gets about 45kmkwh jack claims 6 for the fiat no way
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the first rearquarter view of the car made my ageing brain go click 1972 honda civic üòú
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,cheap is even more relative these days who hasnt noticed how things have exponentially gone up in price since pre covid many items are 2 3 even 4 time or more times expensive were unlikely to ever go back down to those levels and most people arent making more money either those companies that arent raising prices are are taking a bath to try and keep prices down or have complete control over the near whole manufacturing and distribution channels
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,welcome to turin a place where respectful manholes are at least 20 cm deep 8 inches and every time the asphalt is replaced they get deeper and deeper and deeper and then you get all the rest on top of it
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i bought a 1 year old peugeot e208 last year for eur24k and absolutely love it how does the 600 electric stack up against it do you think
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,they are the same car stellantis badge engineering isnt it
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,theres a donald duckcomic where daisy starts designing cars specially designed for women this especially the headlights on this thing reminds me of that its very ugly
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,all rear seats should be on sliders in small cars if you have an empty boot why not have more leg room in the back
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,it seems all the cars in this range are the same e208 corsa c4 and now this id like to see a car this size with better range or a smaller one with the same
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,we need a 20000 ev
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,to make this show appear more high tech could you next time convert metric into poles chains and rods
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,cant understand why brand after brand bring out one small to mid size crossoversuv after the other if fiat are going to to a ev version of an ice car why not use the tipo station wagon instead and keep things really simple the lower height will keep it efficient so you dont need a big battery and it would have been noticed as an option to the 13 a dozen suvs
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,efficiency is so important in electric cars i really hope european carmakers understand this and really put all their efforts in that direction also for highway speed efficiency aerodynamics is key that should really be a priority
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,this is true only because batteries are genuinely rubbish for transport more flammable than diesel and so so bulky if batteries cost the same but had 4x the energy density still a far cry from diesel efficiency would be quite irrelevant an academic exercise at best
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,way over priced otherwise ok
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,hi can you please do a feature on the back to back actual cost to of say a weeks motoring in london between comparable electric and ice cars i suggest this because this week i heard someone say with absolute conviction that given current electricity prices that it is more expensive to run an electric cat than an ice one please myth bust this asap thanks
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,but is it efficient also at highway speed
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,these ev car journalists are becoming a jokeüòü
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,where are the small cheap and efficient cars like the daihatsu cuore ford ka honda jazz subaru mini jumbo mitsubishi colt fiat panda suzuki alto with bearly 50 hp and seats a steering wheel and a cheap radio fiat was also good in making small cars with small engines this is a rocket ship with 3 times the power an 2 times the weight at 3 times the price and doing worse fore the invirement
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,it is a nice looking car with a good range but the price is to high
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,it appears not everyone got the memo that one pedal driving is less efficient than just coasting unless youre going down long stretches of downhill where you would be hitting the brakes anyway
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i like the 600e but you have to be fair the version you had prima comes at 42500 roughly so at the same as the base model 3 and that is bigger faster and has better materials but the fiat has better safety features like 360kamers and uss for me the base version red would be the one to go for
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,dont think it really has better safety given tesla vehicles rank top in their respective classes via euro ncap fiat and jeep cars on the other hand are some of the only vehicles to get an abysmal 1 star in the last few years
2023-09-29,ejT6GwY6cSY,armadillito i did 51000km so far and not one dangerous moment due to the car and ux
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,fiat most likely put him in the nicest hotel room flew him first class for all this nonsense
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,it would have been a great electric car if it was priced below 30k at 37k you can buy 2 brand new petrol fiat 500 a 54kwh battery should cost no more than 8k in manufacturing and its development expenses are being shared among a lot of models and brands how could this be so expensive add just 5k and you get a far more performant model 3
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,theyve missed a trick not putting in on ev architecture otherwise it could be a challenge to the zoe i suspect the renault 5 will make this look silly when it comes out
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,007 more 100 more this is the sort of stuff we sign up for and if the editor hit timecode 007 on purpose then collect all the bonus points
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,nice car nice color nice overall design except front clean interior good efficiency high price
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,can someone please make the nissan idx electric id absolutely buy one these new electrics all look the same and we demand style no thanks
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,to be honest the efficiency of 9kwh per 100km sounds ridiculously small given that mercedes super aero eqx had about 9x kwh100km driving at 90kmh with lots of drafting either the fiat 600 was driven quite slow or it really is an efficiency monster
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,a tesla is just a bit more expensive but you have the tesla quality it engineers supports super chargers everywhere and all automatic without credit card etc
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,one pedal driving requires a motor of sufficient power to quickly stop the car using regen braking smaller motors with lower acceleration mean lower deceleration too
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,and yet my 40kwh nissan leaf with the same power output to this fart has 1 pedal driving
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,you have to factor weight in smaller motor on a heavy car yes small motor on a light car not so much other contributing factors as well
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,what sold the fiat 500e to me was one pedal driving and i only have to dab the brakes a couple of times per week from higher speeds to stop them rusting due to lack of use the omission of one pedal driving on the 600e is a dealbreaker in my case
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,one pedal driving seems too complicated im waiting for no pedal driving to become available
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,its not the motor its how fast they can dump power into the batteries a small super capacitor would be great for this
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,markcain268 yeah first there was the manual transmission then automatic then ev gear reduction now a lot less use of the brake pedal actually there is no pedal driving its called adaptive cruise control with stop and go of course if there is no car in front its called go and go through a stop sign or traffic lights but during traffic jams its a lifesaver
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,gregb1599 hmmm i dont think driving in traffic has ever endangered my life
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,markcain268 i never said it did but it is as you say no pedal driving
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,gregb1599 not really driving more like guiding
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the price of this thing is yet another reason just to buy a tesla
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,no one pedal üôÑüòí
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,jack i was cleaning my teeth watching this and i spat my toothpaste across the room when that audi over took you too funny great review as always üòÇ
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,ice cars reached max economy of scale years ago theyre not getting any cheaper when evs reach economy of scale they will be cheaper than current ice vehicles but today there is only one company approaching ev scale and profitability
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,car makers had 10 years to reach economy of scale and still havent achieved squat something doesnt add up here although i doubt its the car companies margins
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,what a beautiful car what a pity its italian reliability is the huge problem of whatever is made in italy really everything
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,smallsimpleoverpriced as meatloaf would say 2 out of 3 aint bad
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,nope we need cheap we need a manufacturer with the nouse to build a car down to a price not up to some imagined standard 8000 for a slow nofrills no options analogue base model 13000 for the comfy family version with aircon and electric windows 18500 for the sporty one ice or ev it makes no difference dont tell me it cant be done it just needs some adjustment of expectations currently in the west the poor have no choice there are no simple cars being made theyre all absurdly overspecced to suit the valueadded appledysongolf club demographic because youre worth it bah never mind range or performance or looks or efficiency or luxury or even safety wealthy drivers already have plenty of options there and nobody is asking them to give up their current models buy and enjoy but we proles have no choices wheres our modernday trabant itd be a deathtrap you say fine dont buy one its my life and my choice ill risk it we need cheap just cheap
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,what about charging did i missed it
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,big brands like fiat keep evading the fact that tesla is the dominant company because of the platform they already built hardware software charge grid customer service even if this one is debatable if other brands pretend to be competitive then this kind of car must sell in the 25k area not the 40k tesla made sacrifices and got the advantage
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,retiredbore378 agree but im talking about business models dont you think that in the 25k range this fiat offer would be selling like hot bread even if it doesnt makes a profit for a period of time like tesla did
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,obviously jack is very rich since when was 33k a tasty price
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,when you can drive it for a fifth of the price of a petrol car long term ownership is very cheap
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the only reason the mg4 costs what it does is because nobody else in the eu is selling cheap evs they could probably sell it for half the price and still make money but why do that if the dont need to
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,stopped watching after no one pedal driving
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i wish fiat would ditch the numbers bring back uno i know its a number punto tipo ritmo etc
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,you lost me at the price we need e cars at 23k to change the world
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,they need early adopters to get down their prices economics hasnt changed
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,been a while since ive seen a car in flymo orange still is it as good as the mg4 no move along then
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,another over hyped tiny useless ev which again cost over 30000p and he has the cheek to call it affordable to the normal money hard up public they cant even be bothered to do it as a full ev ground up build ev no just a old ice converted one which is i believe is called a compliance car a sneaky way to not build a real new flat floor ev but cheat instead and throw a old ice based car at us with a small battery stuck under it and the old drive tunnel still in the way this from a man whom has a polestar 2 ev and even was looking into buying a polestar 3 a ev which is on a totally higher level of cost than this waste of time given being well off i would prefer the mg 4 over this over priced too small over hyped ev any time 33000p they must think we all are thick as a brick and have tons money
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,another affordable ev we will not be able to buy in usa
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the original mg zs ev excite model with grant was approx 23000 in 2019 we need more cars this size but far cheaper
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,good luck in these times and in this market
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,billpalmer2381 chinese car industry salaries vary from about 480012000cny or us6401640 or 5401350 i assume the executives get paid more this is for people doing actual work uk minimum wage is around 1650 a month 40hrsweek 48weeksyear you are literally not going to be physically able to make a vehicle in the uk for the price the chinese can make them not without breaking every labour law in the country
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,this will never happen again
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,it also had half the range of this one
2024-02-01,ejT6GwY6cSY,and not chinese cos that way youre saving 2 or 3k pounds providing chinese economy with nearly 30k pounds at the same time and must be aware that china 1 calls itself strategic partner of putin 2 backs his demands for nato to move out of half of europe and reestabilish quasi soviet sphere of influence there 3 supports any anti western movement there is right doesnt sound like such a great deal for to me for 3000 savings on a car
2024-02-01,ejT6GwY6cSY,brianweston83 and what kind of logics do you chase that using a 500 western phone made in china or equally communist vietnam just because phone industry made it hard not to is supposed to mean i should also pay additional 30 000 on top of that 500 to the chinese for a car when theres unlimited supply of western made cars are you ok there
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,that blue trim on the seats better be optional üòñ
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,too bad its not a from the grounds builtup ev they could build so much better either go all in on ev with a dedicated platform or grab a traditional platform and go hybrid or phev i guess you pay less because the packaging is just done more poorly my next car will probably be phev
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,watched till 515 no way is this only behind the mg4 in price as the cheapest car you need to get to drive the proper competition
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,ehhhhh üòï its not affordable but i bet its profitable if it were small it had to do a lot better at clever ergonomic use of space and not try look like an suv a soft top sun roof would be gorgeous probably an extra 5000 for something that isnt more than 300
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,dont put the word cheap on the video when it quite patently isnt at 33k for the entry level model
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,very expensive here in italy almost as much as a model 3 sr and not so efficient where did you get that data from cmon you are fully charged
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i believe we saw him read it from the screen but the math could have been verified by the distance gone and the recharge kwhs which wasnt done neither did he give the charge rate its no good unless its at least 150 these days
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,yes one pedal driving is annoying or did you mean something else üòÅ coasting rules
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i would go for ex30 over this anytime
2023-09-29,ejT6GwY6cSY,sharonbraselton4302 i definitely would if i was in a need of a new vehicle
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i really like this fiat 600 but at this price point i see no reason to choose it over a tesla model 3
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,you can get a slightly used model 3 for that price nobrainer
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,jason8966a model 3 is 60cm longer with no added value and it doesnt have a rear hatch so in theory the fiat is the clear winner it also looks cooler and has blinker stalks but then what do i know
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,adrianguggisberg3656 you said there was no reason to go for a model 3 over this car btw insert any other ev here to which i replied you can go for a slightly used one in which case it makes absolute sense as you say two view points which is fine you then got all defensive listing some differences out of many more i can do many viewpoints you obviously cant
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,jason8966 no i didnt say there was no reason to go for an m3 at any time you also didnt reply to me when you said one could go for a used one the post right underneath that one was my first post and it was not in response to you it was a response to the original post which states they cant see a reason why someone would choose this over an m3 well there are many people to whoom tesla model 3 isnt the correct answer to every question and that would choose this fiat over it for many good reasons just like a lot of people chose the m3 for equally good reasons
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i dont know how to word this really ive known about the englisheuro two finger fuget bent sign for some time now but never thought about the repercussions of it at 620 jack acknowledges the other gentlemans request with two crossed fingers out the window had he not oh boy the interaction couldve gone quite different üòÖalso on the topic of the car its kinda funny that they killed the 500xl to rename it what is probably shouldve been in the first place lol
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the face makes it looks like a cars character
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,looks lovely just the kind of car id like ill check the price again in 5 years üòÇ
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i cannot imagine using kwh100km as a unit what an abxolutely stupid unit kmkwh wtf is so hard about that i cannot fathom what people think sometimes thanks jack for your efforts in this direction
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,well imagine that you want to drive 150km to see a friend now take that kwh100km and multiply by 15 now you know what you need in kwh to get there its just another way of seeing things not stupid just different
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,stelantis is reluctant to switch to ev hence no must have one pedal drive
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,done away with grey except in the uk where theyre offering it in sand earth of italy also known as metallic grey
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,are you guys covering the chevy equinox ev im thinking about getting that car in the middle of next year but theres not enough videos about it for me to come to a definitive conclusion
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,love it fiat are finally starting to reap rewards of being part of stellantis
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,they developed the excellent fiat 500e before joining stellantis afaik
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,400 km out of a 50 kwh net battery with a suv i doubt that for such a tall and long car with no real aerodynamic focus im pos si bi le and the multiplattform means no space inside cause other ev can do it a lot better than this cause the ice heritage kills the progress
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,lets face it twas the ultimte technological kismet that humans found a dark liquid in the ground that happened to have an outrageous amount of energy per pound stored within now we know that it was a bad idea to use that for fuel so we thus must stop using it the trouble is that the replacements dont offer the same amount of energy per pound and thus result in larger heavier batteries and cars this lovely fiat seems like a nice balance of size weight and performance for the tech we currently have ten years from now that story will be a lot different
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,71 mi per kwh 87kwh100km would be nigh on miraculous efficiency but that cant be accurate with that efficiency overall it would have a range of 362 mi from its 51kw battery stated range is 250mi which is 49 mikwh still quite good but not outrageous
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i love that the people who complain about the prices of electric cars are always the ones that make that kind of money look like a pittance
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,this is another disappointing ev it illustrates the main problem with evs it costs too much stellantis will be lucky if they stay in business the chinese auto makers are going to destroy pathetic little cars like this in price features and quality i am never going to buy a china made ev but the nonasian competition excluding tesla is poor
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,since an electric car cannot regen more than the power the motor is built for this maybe why there is no onepedalbraking on this small one
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i just knew that battery speech was gonna run long i always live that
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,417 cm is a small car and 37000 a low price in 2019 and even june 2020 i could get multiple different models for less than 8000 incl everything now it is 45 times the prices and you call it low id3 is 426 cm and therefore this car is not small maybe you are too tall to judge about what a small car is i can not remember exactly what these models were but in those days we were comparing them with an eup fully equipped which was back then 25000 even though after grants and a discount 13600 which was a lot more than such new citroen and peugeot and what ever would have had cost 37000 is even more than a mg4 which is golf sized car for sure it is a fiat with the usual fiat quality and all the rust included if you do not live in italy or spain and not too close to the sea cause no fiat has ever been made for salt water and rain disapointing totally disapoining cause too big too expensive and most likely any chinese will beat this car in price and features and quality
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,for this money you can buy already an mg5 long range
2023-11-25,ejT6GwY6cSY,much as i love the mg5 i dont think it is for the same market i cant see anyone looking at a fiat 600e and an mg5 the mg4 is a much better comparison you can get an mg4 xpower or an mg4 extended range for the same sort of money as this car with the affinity discount and anyone can get the affinity discount just by joining the mg4 owners club
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,small simple but ludicrously over priced for what it is just goes to show more and more what a good job mg have done
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,carlomorischi3435 erm which reliability problems ive had an mg4 for several months now and with the exception of one minor glitch the auto hold function claims its faulty occasionally although it usually fixes itself within 12 mile its been 100 reliable no visible oil leaks either it may be chinese but its at least as good as anything germany or france churns out
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,theelectricmonk3909 they drive like utter shit no feeling onoff brakes hard to feel what the chassis is doing and the power steering is not consistent with a turn which is probably fine if youve only ever driven corrollas or nissan micras but that doesnt mean its good i imagine you dont live in an area with windy rural roads like nz i drove an mg 3 weeks ago from invercargill to queenstown and i can confidently say its the worst car ive ever driven
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,wigrammartialarts i beg to differ i drive an mg4 and whilst it doesnt have the same engagement as my jag xjr or the pointyclickyness of my old ford capri racing car its perfectly decent to drive perhaps you should actually try one out instead of making specious comparisons with an mg3 which is an older completely different vehicle fyi i grew up in rural cheshire plenty of twisties and ive driven my mg4 in wales which invented the windy rural road it handles just fine the brakes are fine the transition from regen to actual braking is undetectable the low centre of gravity rear wheel drive make it decently entertaining the only fly in the ointment is you cant turn off the traction control so proper arseout fun isnt possible
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,theelectricmonk3909 the car i drove from invercargill to queenstown look the trip up was an mg4 also the xjr is a boat where did i say an mg3
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,theelectricmonk3909 also wales is nothing compared to nz the the country is as long from the top of denmark to the middle of spain and is mostly valleys hills and mountains ive been to wales it doesnt compare
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,wigrammartialarts in the comment i replied to you said i drove an mg 3 weeks ago from invercargill to queenstown and i can confidently say its the worst car ive ever driven have you ever driven an xjr 2001 model
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,wigrammartialarts sadly ive not had the opportunity to go to nz but i have family out there its exactly like wales only bigger you even have more sheep than people just like wales i guess you have hobbits too although wales probably has some of them too ps im obviously not being serious comparing nz to wales although there are similarities in places at least
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,theelectricmonk3909 3 weeks ago not mg 3
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,theelectricmonk3909 yeah very quick in a straight line just not my sort of car and quite old now def a boat
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,wigrammartialarts so whats your favourite steer then boat or no i did enjoy throwing the jag around always a fun car to drive even to the shops
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,carlomorischi3435well most of the reviews ive seen would differ and you clearly have a problem with it being chinese
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,wigrammartialarts but what does that have to do with a cars reliability you dont offer a 7 year 80000 mile warranty on an unreliable car hate the chinese govt all you like theres a lot to hate but the original comment had nothing to do with the car in question and was misleading
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,eldridgep2 i never said they were unreliable i said they feel like shit to drive
2023-11-25,ejT6GwY6cSY,wigrammartialartsive had my mg4 for 15 months and it is absolutely beautiful to drive its great to drive on the hilly country lanes on the west coast of scotland where i live really fast and holds the road really well im not sure you know what car you drove was it an mg4 an mg3 or something completely different
2023-11-25,ejT6GwY6cSY,carlomorischi3435my mg4 is a really good car and ive had absolutely no problem since i bought it fifteen months ago in september 2022 best car ive ever driven
2023-11-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,sailingoctopus1 79 sec to 100kph isnt fast mate ive driven the mg4 zs and mg3 lots of ev owners i found used to buy the most boring petrol cars so they find evs exciting cause theyve experienced a little bit of torque for the first time
2023-11-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,wigrammartialarts how about the mg4 xpower 0100 in 38 seconds do you call that quick 36000 rrp quicker than a lamborghini gallardo nissan gtr and audi etron in a standing quarter mile two seconds quicker round a track than an abarth it put in a creditable time round n√ºrnburgring difficult to call it shit i think
2023-11-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,sailingoctopus1 oh im sorry is that what you own yeah didnt think so thats not what we are talking about is it i dont hate evs i bloody own one just saying most mgs are poor quality comparing a new car with old super cars doesnt really make sense compare it against a current one the general trend of cars is that they get faster over time also just a point to add a fast car doesnt change the quality concerns i have they thing could out accelerate the latest ferrari and still have zero driver feedback and feel clunky
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i understand the price relativity argument but until they can get both energy density and price to ice relative levels then im just not interested
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i think belgium also beats uk in terms of bumpy roads especially when it comes to highways
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,excellent review of a fine carwont be trading my fiat 500 abarth in anytime soonbut will buy the 500 abarth electric
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,ha more of the usual jack every comment is always critical whenever you review any car really why do you bother
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,not going to lie wasnt really watching or interested in the car üòÇ
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,so about 5 miles per kw then based on those figures and battery sure sure sure sure
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,not even close to look like old 600
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,seriously 99 of the civilized world uses kilometers and not miles so use kms when talking in your videos so most normal people understand
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,stellantis are just slapping different car brands on the same platform jeep citroen peugeot fiat the cars might look different but theyre skinned versions of the same compromised platform
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,doesnt maximum efficiency argue for two pedal driving with a frewheeling setting its very hard to truly coast with onepedal driving ok good to have the option but its not for efficiency
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,surprised i doesnt do one pedal driving since the 500e does in range mode
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,sand earth of italy colour option looks fairly grey to me
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,007 he is technically correct thats the best kind of correct i love the fact the new 600 looks cute and mean at the same time
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,italy has a long history of producing great looking andor innovative cars this is nether looks like fiat produced an electric allegro
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,this is just a new design over the electric stellantis platform with the new battery and motor because that platform is used in so many models it should be cheaper and no one pedal drive is a error nowadays
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,soo youve just repeated pretty much exactly what he told us in the review then so a form of mansplaining
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,so its basically only a couple grand cheaper than something like an ioniq 5 that can actually get a reasonable charge in 18 minutes and has 225hp which are pretty expensive vehicles already we need real actual cheap vehicles that compete with the likes of the kia seltos and forte or hyundai venue or elantra there is a reason you see elantras all over the place and its not because they are amazing vehicles
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,at a base price of 33k i wonder how many will stump up that for a shared platform bloated 500 during a cost of living crisis demand for vws ids is falling and im not sure therell be much demand for this with so many comparisons and reviews available today anything sub par stands little chance for that money you could get a 2020 model 3 with 348 miles wltp
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,soo you could buy a used example of a completely different carwhich is in fact a saloon ffs then is that what youre offering as an argument
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,andymccabe6712 ok better comparison someone could buy a new mg4 slightly bigger same range same style of car for 7k less than this fiat
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,thats the whole point an example showing its possible to drive one of the best electric cars on the market or this very average offering from fiat for the same money highlighting what bad value it is if i deeded a brand new hatchback this offering wouldnt be on my list andymccabe6712
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,in the us we remember fiats from the 1970 and 80s how would you ever get us to buy a fiat
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,well you wouldnt buy this one obviously since the tax credits would make a model 3 as cheap if not cheaper but if youre judging car companies based on what they made in the 70s and 80s youre not making intelligent purchasing decisions thats not smart fine if theyre still as bad but this isnt about revenge for some past slight its about being a grown up and choosing the best product to be clear this is not the best product but it doesnt mean another fiat wouldnt be they surely cant be as bad as gm
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,gm you have a point the chevy hhr a car that puts a steel post against the drivers shoulder the last good gm product was the 8992 43 308 rear end full size pickup simple basic 26 mpg down the highway easy to repair evey small town had mechanics who knew that engine jonevansauthor
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the front is crying out for a set of stick on false eyelashes above the headlights and a set of contrast coloured lipsticked up lips painted around the front intake
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,for everyone whos saying this is expensive have a look at a similar new fossil car a seat arona 10 with 110bhp costs 34000 euro an opel astra 13 costs 33000 euro new cars are expensive
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,are there any cheap new electric cars is the wuling bingo available in uk or europe
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,or a hyundai i20 197k to 25k or for the price of this you could get an i30n with 280ps
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,and collapsing residuals mean that thisll be a bargain in two or three years great news for everyone wholl never be able to afford the depreciation of any new car
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,true but eg a new mg4 starts at 26k iirc about 7k cheaper than this fiat for a slightly larger vehicle with similar capacity similar range slightly better performance
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,logicalchimp i would love if things like that came to canada the only reasonable small evs are the bolt leaf and kona all of them are kind of expensive and charge slowly
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,i can pick up a corsa 12 litre with a massively greater range new on car wow for 15300 enough said eh this car is more than twice as much because it is electric and a similar size
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,for the op er not exactly that simple new cars are expensive because until the electric car imposition an equivalent petrol engined car with a gearbox was around 15 thousand once the message that evs were so expensive to produce was well ingrained in the little brains of the populace the next step was to bring all cars up to the same pricing levels a vehicle with an engine and gearbox is more expensive to produce the same platform with a set of batteries and no gearbox costs less the rest is a massive con and by all accounts a forced one at that
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,m3photo726they also fail to acknowledge that dacia mg hyundai kia citroen ssangyong and suzuki can sell you a new petrol car for under 20k we are paying for the enforced rd of electric car development fomo practices and greed
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,stevezodiac491 youre not comparing apples with apples list price is being quoted and youre using a discounted car wow price you need to compare with the car wow prices for any other of the models mentioned in this thread as well as the fiat 600 although it would need to have been on sale for a while before the car wow deals start happening the massively greater range comes at a cost of 160 per litre and 150 per year road tax and substantially higher maintenance and servicing costs how many times do you need to drive 524 miles in a day
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,italian car made in poland on the same production line as the american jeep avenger just rebadging and cosmetic differences like the the id3 cupra born all too expensive
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,jonwragg3822 apple iphone american made in china or india in the same factory as many samsung galaxy phones galaxy s23 just rebadging and cosmetic differences what nonsense the important thing is where it was designed and from where it was commissioned
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,carlyleroadi regularly drive up to the scottish highlands 300 400 miles where range is very important a car should be bought for all scenarios not just local driving i have had an electric car from new for 7 years 5 months it has done 37k in that time and has lost 13 rd of its range and battery capacity because of dendrite formation it is now used by the wife as a shopping trolley within its octopus go home charger range only i started off with it thinking it was the best thing since sliced bread now i think that evs are just not fit for purpose with the experience of them i now have as for the corsa it is there to buy now as is this car and it is irrelevant that this car has just come to market if i was buying a new car now i would have the corsa 12 petrol in a heartbeat and save the other 19000 or so and all the expense range and charging anxiety it is just not worth it as is the ev or any ev for that matter by the way 19000 equates to 132000 miles at 50 mpg not including the alternative cost of electricity that should get a few repairs brought penny wise and pound foolish
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,i can get a one year old petrol corolla for 17000 so what is the point of me getting this instead theres no way in hell ill save 16000 or equivalent in pounds over the next 1520 years if i chose the 600e
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,snerdles2023 nissan leaf 2500 miles 18600 autotrader
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,jsanders100 and there are no small used cars that are cheaper than that pos that takes an hour to fast charge
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,konsaiastaiyet somehow this fiat will be a commercial success despite all the similarly priced and cheaper chinese cars which are better in every way and even thw nissan leaf and the teslas european consumers are sheep
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,i got an offer from a dealer to buy a new toyota yariz for 16k euro
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,or maybe just compare the gas powered fiat 500 its like double the price
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,carlyleroad that price difference buys about 15k miles a year for 6 years however
2023-10-02,ejT6GwY6cSY,considering that you can get a better price even with vauxhall ecorsa a mass batteryproducing car manufacturers will wipe out the floor with these great offers once they start producing smaller things just look at the tesla model 3 price on the us website or basic id3 in europe and compare their value difference to fiat then try to fool yourself about getting a good value when this one has cramped internal space despite being just under 10cm shorter than id3 due to fiats cost savings on developing dedicated architecture fiat will not be able to produce these things in large numbers anyway so leave them to italian patriots collectors similarly to the early unreliable software cursed id line vw evs that were also mostly bought by patriotic germanspeaking audience while others rather chosen financial conservatism by timeproven tesla
2023-10-03,ejT6GwY6cSY,brunoheggli2888 the cheapest dacia sandero in the official uk shop starts at 14k yet you cannot drive through the center of london with it even today and who knows how many cities will join in a couple of years so unless you live in a remote part of scotland where you visit just local town shop i would not bother with anything that is not at least hybrid dacia sandero also received a 25 star rating in safety tests which is another reason for most in western europe to not even bother when you consider that you must go to around 20k if you are lucky to get at least a decent somewhat reliable small hatchback hybrid like toyota yaris and take into account all the fuel and maintenance expenses over the expected 1520 year lifespan evs financial side suddenly does not look that bad but things start to get really interesting for normal people only once you look at a few years old cars which are currently the only ones priced somewhat reasonably because the new hybrid yaris which price rose by over 13 from prepandemic times is hardly a great deal while evs due to fast innovation in this segment often dropping in prices a lot to a levels even normal people can afford them these days
2023-10-07,ejT6GwY6cSY,gpw203 the cost of steel rose during a pandemic rather significantly and newer cars are expected to be equipped with advanced safety systems that were not required previously on ice cars which are pretty much standard on by default more expensive evs this was done likely intentionally to make evs look better purchase by leveling up plane field in safety prices of popular electric cars like skoda eniaq or ford lightning have risen over 20 from their initial price while tesla despite reducing factory worker wages as they are not unionized openly told that they were keeping higher prices than necessary to compensate for the unpredictability of the market during the pandemic but as wages will rise due to strikes to level up with inflation you can bet that further rise in the cost of cars in unionized factories is inevitable and while tesla can reduce prices due to recent improvements in manufacturing efficiency legacy manufacturers purchasing costlier than necessary batteries and lacking purpose build ev factories will be hard pressed to follow teslas market gain due to price reductions for years to come which they would do likely anyway as there is higher demand than supply for multiple nontesla evs so dont worry everything will be costlier and that trend will continue for years despite pandemic more or less being a nonissue for developed nations at this point until the supply chain and factory worker wages stabilize many governments trying to push evs by making ice cars less viable through various legislations while there is also a visible push to get as many people from car to public transport as possible by making ice cars unfeasible is one of the ways if the us will have decent public transportation you will see exactly the same trend repeating there too this trend will make many people in rural areas angry as already happened in france where leadership was bluntly trying to raise the gasoline tax for the sake of the environment despite rural folks often dont have much choice so if this will not be handled with regard to economic limitations of various groups you can expect a lot of riots in the future as govenrments will try to push poorly conceived legislations
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,again the deluded thoughts of rich people 1 32k aint cheap sub 20k is a must 2 250 range is appalling in reality thats about 200 with heatingair con on all we want is to be able to ipswich to birmingham 300 mile round trip with a bit of local driving thrown in so a genuine 400 mil3 range most ice cars can do that on a tank with a trailer caravan o4 roof boxbikes on it 3 its not a family car norway are you getting 2 adults one short one 6ft teenager in that car plus luggage to go on holiday 4 i bet it doesnt allow a tow bar to tow a caravan or trailer to preserve that interior when doing the dump run when we have an electric car priced at 20k that can do a real 400miles that has a tow bar and doesnt have to be recovered to a dealer to replace a tyre then we will talk but sorry all the car makers and the experts keep deluding themselves that the latest car out is the next ev to break through but none of them do
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i dont want to suggest that a nissan leaf is as good as this or the mg but you can still get a brand new one for more than 10k less than this oh and you get one pedal driving
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,only ev i can afford is the mg 4
2023-11-25,ejT6GwY6cSY,get one then its a brilliant car ive had mine nearly 15 months its so good to drive
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,so in summary more expensive than a mg4 lower wltp than a mg4 less space than a mg4 and less performance than a mg4 so i suspect not the ev we have all been waiting for
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,olivergilbert better built that is literally the first time anyone anywhere on the planet has said that about an italian car
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,forget mg4 there is estate car mg5 plus the zs which is a crossover
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,phweakwilled given global supply chains the the china dominance around battery production i suspect much of it is chinese even if it is assembled in europe
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,can the mg4 do 6 miles to the kwh though
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,showme360 im far from convinced that a 600e can in normal driving in uk temperatures rather the warm italy with the ac and heating off the official wltp is less than the mg4 so me thinks not
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,fiat topolino is their cheapest all electric car its only 6700 this is 33000 five times the price its not cheap
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,same as the new jeep ev
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,üòÇ sorry fcs but the only way forward is less cars not more whatever kind they are this is still a big heavy city carthing costing everyone a lot of money by subsidarizing its use in streets tunnels bridges traffic lights spaces etc its ludacris and asocial cheers
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,nice little car we have an old suzuki swift we want to replace and this looks like a good option on another subject i saw some video today saying that the reason wales introduced the 20mph limit was due to the extra breaking distance of the evs due to their weight will these people stop at nothing to blame evs for everything
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,extra braking distance of evs good grief thats a new one let me guess did that originate from the sun and its evhating ev column
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,hououinkyouma1458 yep my point precisely sure thats undoubtedly heavier but i suspect that this is just ice car users resisting the advance of time until their beloved antiques are removed from the road
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,nickaskew you see those who already own ice cars have to justify it but new buyers are at least considering evs now but given the huge media coverage over antiev news means that ev adoption is happening insanely fast which is terrifying fossil fuel and legacy car companies into investing millions in anti ev and anti climate change propaganda but this will just worsen the bleeding for thempeople arent as stupid as the media claims you cant just hide all the fires storms floods pollution and diseases that are happening everywhere plus the insane heat all over the world in my country temperatures reached 4143 degrees for over 2 weeks in multiple sets it became so hot that at some places peoples foot got stuck in the molten asphalt you cant just hand wave reality away like that no matter how much money you pay lol
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,theelectricmonk3909 probably but i saw it on some channel by a guy whos some london cab driver
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,retiredbore378 yes thats my opinion too i live in a country where the most common vehicles weigh a few tens of kilos at most they are bikes but still we see enormous suvs being driven around too a point this cabby might be right on is that the evs tend to be bigger vehicles because only wealthy people can afford them at the moment so they tend to be bigger but this fiat and its sibling is a step in the right direction
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the big issue with stellantis is they start them way above mg4 on price and then in 6mths they discount their cars they should start their cars a little lower and stick to their prices as this motor battery pack and software is across their brands their efficiency will be the same
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,its an odd take on the 500 design language that jeep sorry fiat but blowing up the 500 to a much larger jeep sorry fiat doesnt always work out so well as weve seen before how is the driving position of the jeep sorry the 600e is it a typical italian driving position or is more european in its staring wheel to pedal position the jeep sorry fiat driving position tended to be uncomfortable over long distances
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,in fairness i couldnt fit in the back of an mg4 if the driving seat is in my position in fact only someone with rickets or no legs at all could fit back there and im almost as tall as you are as i discovered last week to my annoyance im used to being the tallest person in the room üòÜ my old xjr was almost as cramped in the back too
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,aaaand the chinese came up with something better and at a third of the price
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,im short and fat its nearly impossible to determine if any evs actually will work for me
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,just wait for the 25000 euro cars like vw id2 renault 5 model 2 etc you can also check out mg4
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,mg4 long range is 28k 280 mile range
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,jack thanks for acknowledging the irritation so many of us feel in calling cars in the 30000 price range affordable you could go the whole way and stop calling them cheap and around the cheapest too less expensive and around the least expensive would be so much more realistic for us mere mortals who will never be able to afford anything over 20000
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i wouldnt disagree but have you noticed how things have exponentially gone up in price since pre covid many items are 2 3 even 4 time or more times expensive those that arent are where companies are taking a bath to try and keep prices down or have complete control over the near whole manufacturing and distribution channels
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i just did a quick search and found that im at the 83rd percentile for individual income in the us yet even 20000 pounds would be impossible for me
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,audiovideophile5317 agreed my income is 83rd percentile in the us yet this car is comically out of reach for me
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,you need more second hand cars most people dont buy new cars or if they do its on finance the supply of sh evs is growing significantly now and will be a small flood in a couple more years this will make them accessible to a lot more people ive never bought a new car in 35 years even though i can now afford to i might have to to get an ev because some poor buggers need to otherwise there will be no sh ones my cars have cost 4001988 251991 11001992 3001996 45002001 so far and i might be spending 9800 this week on another to join ev club is at least 35 grand 46 grand for an unconverted van and 81 grand for a converted one im still psyching myself up for that
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,xxwookeyi joined the ev club for 50 a week admittedly cant beat 25 what was it
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,xxwookey 35 grand is not the entry fee at all you could have joined for much less a few years ago and still can today we bought a 30kwh leaf brand new 8 years ago for 17k a 2 year old one for 105k a year later recently swapped one of them for mg4 at 255k where we got 65k back for the second leaf after 6 years of ownership 4k depreciation over 6 years fantastic
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,totally agree evs are way overpriced for what goes into them they should be half the price of an ice car
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,brand new ice cars are in the same price brackets now though its just inflation there is no crossover with any decent amount of gear sub 30k
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,are there many fossil fuel cars these days that can be called affordable
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,afz902k can you buy a new ice car for that kind of price i dont think so
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,kiaenirodiariesencore4270dacia mg citroen hyundai and kia offer new budget petrol powered cars at a glance all sub 20k ssangyong and suzuki are also competitively priced as well
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,sdjmchattie you are absolutely right sh cars have been available for some time in limited numbers and things like the mg4 are relatively cheap for 35 grand i was talking about new cars that might suit our purposes i didnt make clear that my car is a campervan so i am looking at the much more limited longish range van market or maybe a big car we did try an enyaq where you really do have to pay quite a lot of money at the moment this will improve over time
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,jsanders100 25 was a petrol citroen visa which had been rallied a bit which i actually bought just for its spare headlights for the c15 but actually it ran for another 10 years before we got rid of it only broke down twice in that time iirc remarkably good value
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,kiaenirodiariesencore4270 yup i am in western europe and a new kia picanto goes for around 14k mitsubishi space star and citroen c3 12k some dacia cars like the sendero are around 1213k fiat panda 14k and the list goes on but honestly i wouldnt even buy it new with 12 years of use the price gets even lower thats the spot i like to be at when buying cars because they depreciate so rapidly ive bought new cars before and you always end up selling at much lower prices eventually
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,realistically no one sensibly affords to buy a car over 20k because you pretty much disregard the price for normal economics the somewhat sensible way to buy a new car is to pcp it where youre only paying for the depreciation basically or lease it and worry less about some of the wear and tear costs at the end of the day its never really a good idea to lump tens of thousands into any depreciating asset with no protection against depreciation which is why pcp is the more affordable and sensible way of doing it on the proviso that you get good apr but you often get little incentives for taking the finance eg dealer contribution discount
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,wheeldesire if you intend to keep a vehicle for a long time then outright purchase is by far the cheapest option but obviously you only get that option if you do actually have the cash so i dont agree with the idea that its never a good idea to invest in an expensive depreciating asset the shorter the ownership period the lower the extra costs of pcp or leasing which as you say do have advantages in terms of derisking the dealers are keen to get you to take the finance because that is normally more profitable for them than a cash sale its certainly true that most people choose the certainty of a fixed monthly outgoing but should recognise that one is paying extra to minimise risk of lossgain due to price fluctuations i cant see myself ever using pcp because i just dont like paying extra for finance when i dont have to and im fine with the associated risks and normally keep vehicles for at least a decade
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,xxwookey i think a personal contract purchase car loan is a good option when buying a new car and probably also not bad for an expensive used car its a lot easier than suddenly parting with a lot of money especially if you get a good fixed annual percentage rate i think for anything over 10k id personally get one as they usually include insurance costs for the whole period of the loan bundled in and that just saves you the effort of getting insurance on top of the purchase of course you need to watch out for bloated insurance costs because some dealers love to slap those in lmao
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,if you allow for lost interest on the money no longer available for other investment due to being invested in the vehicle then it gets closer but the order doesnt change lease 26726 pcp 18908 hploan 17926 buy outright 15840 assuming 4 interest in investments which is somewhat in flux these days that was probably fair for a year ago when this was made
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,in fairness the average price of a new car in the uk is around 36k last time i looked
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,penelope pitstop would love the front and the eyebrows hopefully fiat have done a decent rhd conversion that means those with size 12 shoes can drive it unlike the 500 me i love the fiddly buttons and the efficiency but id wait for a cheaper more basic panda with one pedal braking
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,xxwookey if youre curious so far this year 60 of new cars are bought by fleets and leased to people via their jobs 40 are private sales of the private sales 90 are financed in some way evs account for 3 of private sales and about 25 of fleet sales
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,siightiybored i hadnt realised such a large percentage goes to fleets is that just cars or does it include vans presumably it includes rental car fleets too
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,xxwookey thats just noncommercial vehicles so a few vans but mostly cars rental fleets come under business sales those account for about 2 of sales i ignored them earlier because it doesnt move the needle
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,awsome review the highlander ps kindness is still free
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,id be really interested in seeing how many people think they cannot afford an ev at 20000 but would happily buy an ice car at 15000 the total cost of ownership is the important factor
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,nealeupstone 5000 difference would happily pay for 4 years of driving for most people thats why
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,which is weird when youve got gm producing packs at 100 per kwh by that metric the battery portion of this car is only 4400 6700 if you go by average pricing as reported by the epa how on earth does it start at 10000 higher than the 2023 fiat 500 and end 16000 higher at the top end
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,ive been saying exactly the same thing for a couple of years now but to no avail the facts of course are simple until the price drops then most of us wontcantbuy them even though we would like to thats why for now the new sales ev stats are not completely honest but they will be eventually presumably until then most of us are excluded
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,xxwookeyi wouldnt buy a second hand ev unless it came with at least a ten year battery warranty which even new ones dont come with changed my last car when it was 19 years old with over 200k miles dont think ev batteries will achieve that
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,christopherhume8896 well it remains to be seen but i expect you will be wrong about this more than half of cars are now lfp batteries those are typically good for 6000 cycles thats about 60 years if charged twiceweek 16000miles year so those batteries should be the best part of a million miles before being knackered this should be true of half the cars sold this year so for most cars it wont be the battery that wears out first
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,xxwookey when used in an electric car the average degradation is 23 each year according to a study of 6300 evs by geotab a telematics company in practical terms this means that an ev with a 300mile range should still be able to travel around 231 miles between charges after 10 years batteries are definitely getting better but still a few problems
2023-09-29,ejT6GwY6cSY,siightiybored ultium is also a structural pack or at least it is on some vehicles like the gmc hummer i also have no clue what the stellantis tax but my searching has concluded youre probably referring to taxes subsidizing the production which is hilariously cheap compared to what we give gas vehicles and oil companies
2023-09-29,ejT6GwY6cSY,ryanthompson3737 im referring to the 5000 of bullshit stellantis adds to all their evs compared to how much a battery should cost
2023-09-29,ejT6GwY6cSY,christopherhume8896 im willing to bet it doesnt include any simple battery maintenance such as using the 8020 rule or preconditioning the pack before charge and discharge etc a lot of cars now have these features baked right in something that wasnt the norm earlier on
2023-09-29,ejT6GwY6cSY,siightiybored oh yeah i call that the ev tax even if the motors and wiring cost exactly the same as a whole ass engine gas tank oil system coolants etc which it does not the battery will cost say 10000 and their car is 15000 more expensive than their gas model they increase the price because they know regular people are already out of the running at a 10k premium
2023-09-29,ejT6GwY6cSY,cheap expensive is just the range of what is offered you suggest that even the cheapest car is expensive so whats the next up from that super expensive ultra expensive that makes no sense if the cheapest bread is 10 and the rest is on average 100 then the 10 bread is to be considered cheap
2023-09-29,ejT6GwY6cSY,audiovideophile5317 but you have to compare cars with cars ie petrol verse electric
2023-09-29,ejT6GwY6cSY,xxwookey so if most people dont buy new cars were do they come from to be second hand
2023-09-29,ejT6GwY6cSY,thomasbroker69 so you are an expert on the cost of producing cars are you so why are you not employed by ford or someone instead of trolling the web
2023-09-29,ejT6GwY6cSY,grahamjohnson4702 from the people and fleets that do buy new 60 of new car sales are fleets there are more 2nd hand than new buyers for each car on average im guessing average ownership is 3 or 4 for each car in which case there are 23 times as many sh buyers as new
2023-10-01,ejT6GwY6cSY,i buy used cars for 3k45k and theyre great making the leap to electric in that budget is currently not realistic
2023-10-01,ejT6GwY6cSY,its a 17k euro car trying to sell for 33k euros good luck
2023-10-04,ejT6GwY6cSY,saying you cant claim something is the cheapest in its category is like saying you cant call chicken the cheapest meat because its never going to be as cheap as rice yes they are both in the overall category of food but they are in different subcategories within that i realise that this is out of the reach of many people but thats to a large extent because there is virtually no second hand market yet
2023-10-07,ejT6GwY6cSY,nickclarkuk to confess yes i bought it in 88 yes its listing for a lot more than that now i live on the kitsap peninsula west of seattle i still have a tough time justifying spending that much on a car
2023-10-07,ejT6GwY6cSY,riverratwa57 same my last car was 4500 used and its probably worth 3500 after putting 50000 miles on it an electric car at that price would be barely useable
2023-10-08,ejT6GwY6cSY,best comment of 2023 these ev reviews are becoming an insult to peoples intelligence and its becoming worse
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i just stopped watching at no onepedal driving ill just stick to my 2nd hand hyundai ioniq until the renault megane etech shows up on the used market at a decent price 1000017000 cars should not cost more than that in truth
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,we made a new ev just as shit as the old ev now with extra colours no heat pump in fact battery management is bog simple and youre on your own basically no pm motor and its about as expensive as a model 3 especially for the version you would actually want
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,what a bland boring design cheap it is not i get the impression that jack was trying to find positive things to say so that fiat will give you another car to drive in the future
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the bonnethood of the 600 is long enough to fit the ice engine of the plugin hybrid that is the price that is paid for a shared platform
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,oh theyre still using this for ice that would explain everything about why its so obviously bad how shameful
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,hit the nail on the head there neil another manufacturer trying to save money by cobbling a car together from common parts across there inventory when will they learn that a true ev can only be manufactured from the ground up
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the bonnet of a tesla is long enough to fit an ice engine in or an mg4 or a vw id3 or 4 and theres several ice cars that dont have long bonnets the proper mini citroen picasso i reckon manufacturers make them that shape because they think thats what buyers want
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,moses_vii my point exactly the sticky out bit at the front isnt just wasted space where the engine used to go
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,well there are 454 litres in a gallon and a litre of petrol has 112 kwh of energy so 509kwh per gallon so if you drive at 45mpg which is pretty good youd be using 509kwh per 45 miles which is 088miles per kwh this electric car does more than 6miles per kwh hope that helps
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,efficiency relates to cost per mile especially at the lower price bracket cost per mile is important just as mpg is important with the high price of public charging a lower cost for motoring is attractive even if the price of this vehicle is not cheap
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,for comparison my tesla model 3 gets 299 watts per mile while this video says this car gets 166 watts per mile that is impressive for a cost comparison my car at my electricity cost is 267 cents per mile while this one costs 152 cents per mile so this car is about 3000 cheaper msrp and a little cheaper to drive per mile but doesnt qualify for the 7500 tax credit in the us if it was sold today also remember the comparable cars cost per mile of 127 cents per mile
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,nehpets216 the video is mainly aimed at the uk where there is no tax credit
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,solentbum i was using local numbers to show that it would be less expensive over time than my car once this comes over to the us market
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,nehpets216 i do wonder if fiat will bother with the usa one can hope they will but
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,just hope its not made by fiat cheep poor made crap
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,didnt they used to call a small car with a rear door a hatchback give me a break with the crossover crap
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i guess youre a little wrong my friend its efficiency is about 167 kwh100 km according to the evdatabase
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,first of all youre in italy please get some fashion advice i wish i was as tall as you id be wearing nothing but slim fit second of all no matter how much you want to hype this car its still overpriced overhyped and overwrought
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,is the st the ultimate porsche 911 carwow
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,no this isnt the small affordable simple electric car we have been waiting for stop pushing 33k cars they are not affordable for the masses only to the london chattering classes it is overweight and poorly packaged as it not a bespoke ev platform so it is compromised and over priced 8k more than the mg4
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,just a jeep avenger copy paste in the interior they give you the illusion of choice but what you are really buying is just the same car no differentiation whatsoever at least the chinese give you real differences between car brands from the same conglomerate smart volvo polestar zeekr
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,not cheap nor really affordable they need to be down at the price the chinese get their evs for we really are getting ripped off here in the uk
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,ive just trawled through autotrader 25k max delivery mileage only quite a choice for 8k less than this
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,needlessly big and heavy and thus inefficient could be just as spacious for less sizeweight if it wasnt a crossover and the same is true of it being a nonpure electric platform fairly expensive the above issues also increases the price of course the only good thing is that it has physical buttons
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,its as efficient in terms of miles per kwh as purpose built evs tesla model y for example so why arent they better platform share is done for the purpose of actually being able to make money on it and makes it cheaper 2 platforms means 2 production lines and higher costs one shared halves costs and dedicated ev platforms arent really showing a huge benefit id far rather it was smaller and more efficient but that goes for all of themnot just this exactly the same drive train is available under a corsa or 208 if you need a smaller cheaper car
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,stevenbilclough2563 good points but the phev line is going to be redundant after 2035ish then theyll have to retool for a dedicated ev architecture anyway makes you wonder why they didnt just bite the bullet and jfdi possibly a lack of government incentive is one answer or maybe theyre just hedging their bets on whether the ev transition will actually ever happen
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,theyve already got a new platform in the pipeline called stla in 3 sizes this is an architecture designed for the interim called cmp one will be phased out and the other brought in as demand for piston cars declines it saves the need to idle and close factories as vw has done if the take up isnt what was expected the citro√´n oli is apparently on stla platform
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,stevenbilclough2563 good to know thanks
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,stevenbilclough2563 _its as efficient in terms of miles per kwh as purpose built evs_ but significantly less efficient compared to if it wasnt a crossover andor had a evexclusive platform _platform share is done for the purpose of actually being able to make money on it and makes it cheaper_ no its done to sell deadend combustion engines that have no future and have terrible resale value that should have been illegal to build years ago _2 platforms means 2 production lines and higher costs_ abolish the combustion models and you have just one production line and get rid of the costs of building combustion engines gear boxes and all the other related nonsense easy and its something they are going to have to do by 2030 or 2035 anyway would have been 2020 by the latest if we had politicians worth their salt who werent massively corrupted by the car industry but
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,its time the norm was under 30kwell under
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,its not cheap or affordable for most people and stellantis still not using a ev specifuc platfrom chinese must be shaking in their boots üòÇ
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,hello mate have you seen this 2024 mg5 review they didnt want us to review this carsauce
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,fully charged yes at 30k plus we have been what a bellend
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,you could just buy a petrol car that does all this ev can and much more beside and then use the money you save on petrol
2024-05-16,ejT6GwY6cSY,so you are saying its not better to buy a petrol car because all the money you save buying it will just go into filing the tank
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,nope a hatchback would be smaller lighter but still more spacious and being smaller and lighter also more efficient
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,landokx6so thats like saying that a particular bit of wood is heavier than a particular lump of lead _that doesnt change the fact that the lead is denser_ the vw id3 is far more spacious for the space it takes up compared to a crossover like the fiat 600e
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,you refer to a crossover suv as a small simple and efficient car seriously as for spacious not compared to its size it isnt crossover suvs are oversized and overweight and thus inefficient having nowhere near as much space for people or luggage as a smaller noncrossover the only good thing about crossover suvs is that they arent suvs
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,its obvious what will be underneath the next small jeep ev then
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,finally a possible replacement for the late lamented ioniq 38kwh
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,while i accept 30k is justifiable for an ev considering your not burning money on fuel still with a 30k price tag purchasing the car you need to pay it off upfront or large down payment and sizeable amount of money monthly which makes the car unaffordable to most
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,im a big fan of small nimble cars with short wheelbases ill also say that im not a fan of hyper aggressive angry face design on cars i personally love my grinning mazda girly false eyelashes on my car however are a bridge too far
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,why would anyone buy this over a volvo ex30 for the same price woefully overpriced
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,yeah theyre far too small light efficient and sensible its not needlessly big heavy and inefficient and you just cant do stuff that makes sense
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i am sad to say i do not like this at all i dont really know who this car is for its not for people who live in the city who would get a 500 electric and not for the people living out of city where a sedan or a wagon would be a better option like a skoda octavia combi ev around same price too so im not sure who its for its not a replacement for the 500 and its not really good for anyone maybe the us market will like it because make all biglarge better mentality
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,make cv2 again we want am electric duck
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,do they sell any fiat evs in the usa
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,jack iown a 500e at the moment but i would consider trading in for the 600e but i am waiting to see what the vw id2 and ford puma will look like
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,ive never had 1pd so i dont care about it yet every bev must have it apparently so long as b mode is strong enough that country lane driving is fun and that speed bumps can be slowed down for by lifting my foot thatll do
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i havent either but i feel like theres a reason why the people who have really advocate for it just like me telling me to ditch their hard drives and go for nvme but you cant explain some things like that to some people they have to try them to comprehend i think in this case though im not seeing people whove tried one pedal driving coming out and cheering when cars dont have it maybe thats enough to give it a go when you get the chance
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,jonevansauthor im also not interested in autonomous selfdriving vehicles just because something exists doesnt mean i have to try it or want to use it im fine driving like i do i enjoy having something to do while behind the wheel and i find moving my foot from pedal to pedal simple enough
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,that costs more than i paid for my exdealer demo audi a4 avant sline dsg with only 190 miles on the clock and for an ugly little fiat dont ever tell me thats affordable take 10k off the price and it would still be too expensive
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i like the colours i find it more difficult to see grey cars when im cycling it would be great if they could get rid of the tinted glass as well so i could see if anybody was inside the car when its parked at the side of the road then i wouldnt need to keep a meter and a half distance to it
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,we could have a better signal than that like a light that stays up when the car is stationery and the driver is in it they should also have blind spot cameras warning them of oncoming cyclists by now but that probably wont happen until theyre allowed to get rid of wing mirrors and move to cameras entirely
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,jonevansauthor it must already be legal to do away with the wing mirrors in favour of cameras because the honda e remember that one already did it there are others too although i cant remember which ones i assume cost is whats stopping more manufacturers from doing the same
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,ah the 500e was good enough for us one of the only 2 door cabrio evs that can do a usable 300km but with 38000 for the 500e cabrio it is not affordable so fiat has build a 4 door car just like all the other manufactors in the world they created the boring 4 door 5 person 600e whow to compare the 500e cabrio is 20000 with the extra cost for the higher loan intrest the ev will be over 40000 being double the price of the ice version guess what most people can afford and 38000 starting price for the fiat 600e isnt making it more affordable doesnt it europe can build affordable evs with a minimum range of 300km for the masses the chinese can the byd or mg4 are by far the better choice there are countless ice 5 person cars with a range over 600km for less than 25000 idiotic to by a car for 40k that can do the same
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,there are countless ice 5 person cars with a range over 600km for less than 25000 idiotic to by a car for 40k that can do the same the one tank range is literally only an issue if youve never owned an ev after about 4 weeks with one youll realise that how far you can travel in a single stint is completely irrelevant
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,theelectricmonk3909 not so with the smaller evs there products that can only do a range of max 60km to 100km lots of people come with those cars as proof that there are affordable small evs that is why a minimum range in cars is relevant when you want to compare usable evs with normal ice cars the fiat 500e is literally the only small ev with a minimum practicle use of 300km any ev that is compared with all ice cars should be able to go on a highway and do 100kmh minimum and a 300km range otherwise it is not comparible with an ice car but more with a city scooter with a roof
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,bmwhp2 id personally be fine with an ev that can do 200km but im never going to pay more than 15000 for something like that i can buy any used ice car i want for about 5000 and even if immediate repairs cost me another 2000 if i drive that for 1520 years assuming it doesnt rust away or dies in an accident even considering fuel costs maintenance and taxes ill still have more money left over than if i bought this 600e instead these prices are utter madness
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,konsaiastai totally agree about 20000 is the limit for the masses for a new car that 250km range is about the distance that people on average do on longer trips without stopping to rest anyway so 300km real world range is needed to have a margin to find a working charger with 200km youll have to look for a charger around 150km to be safe that will become a huge bother on weekend trips charging 1 time to get to a 500km destination is reasonable looking for a charger charge and go back on the road will take you around 45 minutes but charging every 150km on a 500km trip will set you back 25 hours to destination and an other 25 hours back that is 5 hours charging on 1 weekend trip no fun so 300km real world range should be the bare minimum when people compare evs with ice vehicles for the time being we will keep our ice smart cabrio 45ltr on 100km
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the lack of one pedal driving is a real shame although i can get behind most of the design decisions here with the exception of the styling at the front i really dont like the face on there it just seems cheesy to me to be honest i think i would be more likely to go for an mg4
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,did you hear the uk government want to stick a tariff now on chinese made evs as according to them the eu car makers cannot compete with them over cost finally we get a sensibly priced ev se standard range and when i say sensibly 26k is still high but its the same as an equivalent petrol or diesel car and this is the result not confirmed as yet but being banded around parliament grrrrrr artful rob
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,robertdodge yet brexit is about to have us add a nice fat tariff to european cars too its all madness
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,87 kwh 100 km thats crazy
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,yeah thats def crazy efficient my smart eq is using around 1617 kwh100 km
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,about 72 miles per kwh i think that is really good i think youd see a big hit to that for rain motorway driving for comparison our hyundai kona gets about 55 for what i would guess would be similar driving 42 at 70 mph on the interstate with ac on 32 for 70 mph with wet roads and the heating on in 10c
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,is it rear wheel drive or do you have all the extra complexity and cost and maintenance of driving the front wheels unnecessarily in an ev
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i hate one pedal driving so its good to see it doesnt have one
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,noone but noone ever discusses depreciation when discussing cost affordability good job its relatively cheap cos itll probably be worth sod all in a couple of years discuss true cost of ownership guys not its got a massive boot pity about the rear passenger space or passenger space is amazing pity about the small boot or big boot lots of passenger space pity it isnt smaller etc
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i like it but the front is just a bit too cutsy for me i wish it was just a bit more unisex like fiats of old
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,my next car üòä
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,cheap and cheerful at 33000 omg either i am very poor or these prices are just ridiculous
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,he never said cheap he said small and simple
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,atulmalhotra2303 tasty price tag hardly a tasty price tag for a small car that for most people will be of limited use
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,he did say a tasty price but that could have a few meanings
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,530 is pretty relevant to this conversation
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,hououinkyouma1458 no cheapest tesla is 43k in the uk
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,hououinkyouma1458 probably although it should be recognised the uk price will include taxes and there are no discount type incentives here any more so we pay full whack
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,evs cost more upfront and less post purchase gas cars cost less upfront and much more after the fact all things being equal which they arent
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,when the prices drop to around 20000 to 23000 ill start to get interested
2023-09-29,ejT6GwY6cSY,cheap expensive is just the range of what is offered you suggest that even the cheapest ev is expensive so whats the next up from that super expensive ultra expensive super duper etc that makes no sense if the cheapest loaf of bread is 10 and the rest is on average 100 then the 10 bread is to be considered cheap
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,no wonder the eu are going to spank tariffs on chinese evs 33k when an mg costs 8k less an easy choice for most peoples wallets
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,and no proper ev architecture bruh please
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,we need sub 25k electric cars
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,tesla is planning on releasing their model 2 or whatever they call it in 2025 for 25k if they can every other eu car maker maybe screwed vw have shown the id2 but no price and byd will be bringing the seagull to the uk dont like byd but even though i have a mg4 on order dont think electricity is the answer still think its hydrogen or a synthetic fuel wonder why they cannot make a good bio fuel like they did with bio diesel
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,robertdodge disagree with dont think electricity is the answer but i would agree that lithium ion batteries arent the final answer although theyre doing reasonably well at the moment hydrogen has a number of problems extracting it storing it and transporting it for example which mean its unlikely to be an answer for carsized transport but could be good for trucksbuses andor ships maybe synthetic fuel solves the transport problems of hydrogen but whilst burning synthetic fuel may be carbon neutral it doesnt address any of the other problems nox sox and particulates to name just three i think synthetic fuel will be great for those of us with classic ices that we dont want to or cant afford to electrify and historic motor racing i expect it to be far too expensive for your average chap or chapess to use in their daily driver
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,robertdodge biodiesel is even more carbon intensive than regular diesel bio fuel offen needs lots of space to grow the plants used in production the suns energy is not energy dense and photosynthesis even less also it does not resolve the other pollution issues aside from co2 evs tackle both ghg emissions but most importantly imo pollutants that have a direct influence on the life of people around cars in cities etc
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,theelectricmonk3909 the notion that synthetic fuel is carbon neutral gets plastered around by people and organizations who are interested in staying with the status quo for as long as possible we are in reality very very far away from carbon neutrality with most synthetic fuels
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,ethanol is the best bio fuel like they did with bio diesel and its already in uk unleaded at 5 or 10 any more and cars need to be redesigned to accept the fuel which can damage fuel systems unless they are replaced in south america e85 is more common however it has been proven time and time again that its a horrendous use of land to grow either bio ethanol or bio diesel that is why these are not widespread the only other option is you make synthetic fuel from co2 in the atmosphere its extremely hard to scale up and extremely electricity intensive to do it would be worse for nearly every use case synthetic fuels have just two purposes in a rational future 1 become a source of hydrocarbon based fuels for industries that have serious physical first principle problems that prevent them being electrifiedbasically passenger aircraft 2 as a luxury commodity to run in cherished historical cars of historic value or personal joy for those that can afford this inefficient use of land for everything else renewables and nuclear across the grid to be stored in batteries for cars makes much more sense
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,robertdodge hydrogen for cars is a non starterand a red herring spouted by ff companies
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,we already have those to be fair we need sub 18k cars to be common and preferably sub 14k would be easier if car companies were actually trying to make good products
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,after rebates my leaf plus bigger battery version was 23000 which is about 19000 equivalent you can get bolt evs for similar prices
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,plus hydrogen leaks its a very small molecule and impossible to not leak it into the atmosphere at every stage of manufacturing and use thats a probem because h2 in the air binds up existing oh hydroxide molecules that are already doing something positive the oh molecule normally and naturally bind with ghgs and neutralize their effect with hydrogen h2 comes in and binds with oh first preventing the oh from doing its good thing leaking h2 cant be prevented and if deployed widely as hydrogen proponents want would very likely make climate change worse theelectricmonk3909
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,but how is the hydrogen made at the moment its far from carbonneutral and green hydrogen is not anywhere near the scale of production that would make it compete seriously with evs in terms of climate impact robertdodge
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,markythegreat fun fact what became known as the diesel engine was actually designed to run on peanut oil diesel the fuel didnt exist when diesel the man invented his compression ignition engine
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,helloitssigmar agreed most synthetic fuel which is not the same as biofuel which might be carbon neutral but brings a whole new set of environmental problems to the table of course is far from carbon neutral i believe porsche have built a trial scale plant in hungary iirc which produces real petrol using co2 captured from the air and hydrogen electrolysed from water all powered by wind energy the key there is trial scale theres no guarantee its scaleable to industrial levels
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the traditional brand giants simply have to complete with chinese electric cars and stop competing with eachother in who gets the most profits
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,theelectricmonk3909 what is the energy in to energy out cost of synthetic fuel so far it is makes zero economic case and therefore it wont ever be used untill petrol is banned or taxed through the roof that isnt on the cards
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,usersd3ik9rt6d youd have to ask porsche both about the economic and environmental credentials however i agree with you far more sensible to use the electricity directly than to fanny about making fake petrol with it
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,toyotaprius79 eu and similar regulations in the uk and elsewhere mean we will never see chinese prices on our shores having been driven around in several chinese cars not evs but domestic vehicles no way would i have one on uk roads theyre deathtraps that said even with the extra costs of complying with european regulations shipping costs and import taxes they can still undercut domestic brands whilst making a tidy profit still im not sure how local brands will compete when labour and property costs are so much higher
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,theelectricmonk3909nissan will become a major ev player in the uk because theyll be the only manufacturer to have both battery and ev factory in the country
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,nikoo033 theres also that new jlr battery factory planned in somerset which hopefully sunaks recent rowback on the 2030 newice ban hasnt put into jeopardy
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,jonathansmith5850 mg do what if youre referring to my comment about local vs chinese brands recall that mg are now a chinese brand id love to see mg production come to the uk but i doubt itll happen unless the uk government introduce some kind of stickincentive along the lines of the inflation reduction act in the us
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,theelectricmonk3909 yeah but that plant wont be a game changer as its output will be a tiny fraction of what nissan will be making in terms of number of evs sold to the masses its just sunak supporting india
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,nikoo033 according to fleetnews itll be one of the biggest battery factories in europe maybe not a game changer but its not some pissy little thing either and whilst it may well be sunak appeasing india the end result will be a good number of uk jobs and itll help keep us in the game all power to nissans elbow too although theyre going to have to do something similar if they dont want to fall foul of the eus rules of origin
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,theelectricmonk3909 nissan is already the largest uk car manufacturer thats why they have an advantage they have everything on site to make evs so wont be subject to the eu rules of origin i suspect when theyll be exporting and if not they will probably mostly sell in the uk what they will have made in the uk so all win
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,robertdodge hydrogen isnt even in the running for private vehicles and efuels will always be for keeping classicspecialist cars alive hydrogen and efuels are both limited by their efficiency to produce due to laws of thermal dynamics they will never be as efficient as electricity batteries and electric motors price parity for small evs has been reached in china as battery material costs have dropped 30 this year and will continue to fall this means medium and larger vehicles with bigger batteries will also reach price parity with ice vehicles evs arent the future anymore they are already here and nothing will be able to replace them in our lifetimes
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,markythegreatexactly you just need to consider efficiencies and production methods and youll always come to the same conclusion renewables evs and electric motors are the way forward hydrogen and efuels have very specific use cases that cannot realistically be electrified these use cases will reduce as battery tech carries on improving for everything else its batteries and electric motors
2023-10-15,ejT6GwY6cSY,whatever happened to dacias cheap electric car is that still coming
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,isnt this just a fiat flavoured peugeot e2008
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,for me nothing will ever justify a new car being classed as affordable when the base trim starts at 33000 since only a tiny percentage of people can fork out 33k outright lets breakdown the monthly cost even with 0 apr standard is around 8 8000 miles a year no deposit over 55 months you will have to pay 600 per month now try to convince us that 600 per month is affordable and thats without insurance fuel costs servicemot etc utter madness
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,what would a gasser in the same segment with similar power options and tech cost you though for a real comparison
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,4literv6 post covid we are being taken for a ride on all new vehicles both new ice and evs are such a ripoff currently if this price trend continues it makes you wonder who is going to be able to afford motoring in years to come
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,jimmyp7928 true however 2019 prices adjusted for inflation put us about where we wouldve been however no more 0 interest for top credit and of course almost no off at the stealership either in fact post covid dealers have gotten away with some murderous markups üôÇ
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,4literv6 inflation has been a killer over the past 2 years vehicle prices were pretty stable for years prior to 2020 despite interest rate changes but i agree with you that it is a multitude of factors including greed prices started rising during the semiconductor shortage and seem to have spiralled out of control ever since
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,4literv6 ive always been curious as to how an electric pickup would work in the states given the big distances you guys cover mind you id always go electric over the 54 8v üòÄ
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,that face makes me think it has something to say like any minute itll start talking to me i really like it if they sell this in north america itll need to work with the nacs so it wont be shit to charge up
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,journalists are the only ones pushing for small efficient cars consumers want big suvs lets see if im wrong and follow how well this car will do compared to all the suvs coming out
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,im a consumer and im desperate for the smallest cheapest ev i can get i do not care about more than two seats or honestly more than one i do not care about having more than 250 litres of boot space because thats a shopping trolley or more anyway id never buy an suv not even with your money
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,jamesgriffint yup apple claimed to be doing the right thing all along but now theyve been forced to go typec their fans are incredibly happy about their future companies often make terrible products watch people buy them and then assume its for the terrible elements they used not other reasons we never bought ice because they were good we bought them because evs werent being made same with suvs there are better options for almost everyone but unless theyre made we cant very well buy them
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,jonevansauthor its nice nice to be a special snowflake but were not talking about your individual desires but rather the market as a whole sedans are disappearing in america where i am compact cars are very much extinct suvs dominate the market consumers speak with their wallet and thats what they want
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,jeddin thats just not how that works if car companies dont sell a type of car you cant buy it youre acting like theyre intelligent yet they still make ice cars so clearly they arent
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,nice car and i really like the brand but this is almost tesla money
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,charliegb03 well it sure as hell isnt fiat money before the pandemic car supermarkets in the uk were full of ice fiat 500s all under a year old for between 7 85k the ev versions arent exactly screaming affordability
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,charliegb03its a modern fiat punto for 75 the price of a tesla that is a ridiculously high figure
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,frobacpanel gaps arent worth that much battery technology performance motor comfort software is i am a guy who prefers korean and chinese over tesla and i like ford but tesla is very good
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,charliegb03i guess we are confusing tesla prices in different countries in america the price of a tesla is closer to this cars price
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,price is mentioned at 515 entry level price is 33000
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,flyingfunthe fully charged show caters to the elite only lol
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,flyingfunaverage people dont buy brand new cars
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,nickfostercheap now ice cars still exist and are being sold
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,for that price i can have a new mazda miata guess which id rather
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,maybe the total cost of ownership is the more relevant metric rather than just the outright purchase price this being said i would never buy a new car myself it just doesnt make financial sense and to be fair most cars sold are used not newlestersuggs
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,thats not cheap when its running against evs like the mg4 and dolphin starting at around 25k new or 22k if you dont mind a couple of thousand miles on the clock
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,thats still cheaper than an ice car considering all the money you save on fuel and servicing over its lifetime
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,sigh smaller than an mg4 yet 7k more expensive for the same range
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,total price isnt the key stat for most monthly lease price will be more important
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the cheapest brand new car available in the uk is an ev admittedly a toy one citroen ami iirc max speed 30mph so good for 90 of motorway driving
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,flyingfun the average person is spending even 20k on a car so really any new car is going to be expensive the point is that it will become a more affordable one as it hits the used market where the vast majority of people get cars
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,_makanko_ and this time they didnt even make it a question they went for the full on cheap exclamation in the thumbnail
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,man people may as well buy hyundai kona electric or tesla model 3 where are chinese cars when you need them mg byd geely etc stellantis being stellantis as always
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,nickfostera new car in the middle east a samand specifically is like 15k usd
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,decimal1815 its the right price for a car not backed by ccp be ready once ursula ban ccp made evs or slap even heavier tariffs you will see the real price of eu made evs
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,moses_vii no wonder they are the main ones behind ursulas investigation no way china make them so cheap ccp must be doing something wrong we are doing everything right and this is the real price
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,so this thing is 4k less than a tesla model 3 which has an wltp range of 513km and is pretty much better in every other way except the ridiculous size i dont think theres enough people here complaining about the lax usage of the term affordable affordable means less than 25k or 20k even for a real car which is to say at least 350km real range and fast charging this is getting ridiculous obviously they are not forthcoming and only the chinese will have access to these for the foreseeable future seeing as the chinese cars the very few of them that sell abroad are sold for double the price which comes out to more or less the same as euroamerican cars a quite sad state of affairs indeed
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,its super cute i like it a lot from what i understand fiat only plans are bringing the 500 to north america that seems a huge mistake i think this would sell better but honestly im not sure either would sell well in america because were kinda daft only like hummers and such
2023-09-30,ejT6GwY6cSY,the good news is fiat cant find america
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,im sorry jack i laughed at your contortions trying to get in the back seat it must be a common problem with your height you are useful high benchmark ie if you can just about get in ill be absolutely fine as the old ronnie corbet joke goes i have a problem with my eyes theyre too close to the ground
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,at 33k this just seems pointless why not just get an mg4 or any of the other low 30s vehicles what the world needs is more small cars that are around 2025k not another 33k car to add to the giant long list of mid 30s cars 2021 called it wants its electric car pricing back
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,exactly the unanswered question posed by this review is why would you buy this over mg4 or atto 3 etc
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,its far more efficient than the mg4 giving the car a longer range defiantly worth something
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,cute car but the price hmmm
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,still an over priced offering i doubt youd find aurelio zen behind the wheel
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,36k in germany for a base microcar and 42k for the softtop is everything but cheap these youtubers are so disconnected from reality
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,how is it a microcar
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,youre disconnected to the reality that exists namely that this is about as affordable as it gets so far how many times must they repeat this your gripe is with the manufacturers
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,jamesengland7461 theyre the ones that tried to make it sound like it was cheap which they continually do they dont have to do that they could say this car would be great if it were 10k cheaper just like people do when reviewing 40 series graphics cards also they could say it would be cheaper if it wasnt also built to keep ice vehicles going on the same body but instead theyre clinging on for dear life with their love of giving people lung disease instead of abandoning new fossil fuel models entirely and working on efficient production
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,jamesengland7461dude they already said themselves that cars will be too expensive for normal people to buy in the near future watch something else than cnn
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,lukei1this car makes an ikco samand look big
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,nice needs to cost 12 of the price
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,wait for 3 years and get it used for around that cheaper evs but built at real scale by 20252026 and mass manufactured solid or semi solid state cells are gonna just decimate the current ev crops long term values imo which is good for adoption long term üòÜ
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,show me a half decent ice car that costs 165k the cheapest 1 litre seat ibiza costs north of 21k most people that comment on the price of evs dont buy new cars and seemingly have no idea of their present very high historically cost i agree that evs generally have a high initial cost but over the life of the car it compares very favourably with ice
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,pinkio2 well said smh most in inventory model 3 rwds near me are 3638k and below 30k after the tax rebate is added insane value in todays car world for what you get imo especially as most toyoduh corolla near me are all over 30k in stock
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,pinkio2 go to a third world country and you will find good cars for 15k usd iraq is an example there is a car i wont call good but it is drivable and its called samand costs about 15k usd however even the good korean cars are cheaper in iraq than in the first world
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,konsaiastaiused which isnt what we are talking about however in iraq it is much cheaper even when new
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the nissan arriya finally came to market and it doesnt one pedal driving i didnt even leave the parking lot because of that why would any ev not have onepedal driving tesla model 3 40240 26sept2023
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,tesla model 3 rwd 42990 52277 in the uk
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,much more interesting than the 500 doesnt look like the type of car you drive if you spend all your jobseekers allowance on eyebrow threading unlike the 500
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,440 selfclosing boothatch why unnecessary extra complication and weight
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,so the poor driver doesnt go deaf when someone slams it shut speaking from experience
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,rngalston slamming could be alleviated by damping the force of somebody closing the boot
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the weight difference between a power hatchback and manual hatchback is negligible its more complicated and more expensive to implement so not really a budget option imo having tolerated a power hatch for 3 years id say the cons outweigh the pros
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,johnnodge4327 just something else to fail quite superfluous like electric seat and mirror adjusment and even windows
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the first manufacturer to realise this will have the market look out the chinese are coming gerry343
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,agree my audis completely pointless electric boot is just slow enough to be annoying when youre walking away from the car and want to be sure it really is closed much better to close a boot manually with a nice clunk and know its really closed
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,origin178first world cars love unnecessary features to justify inflation and thoer features are worse than the old and simple features of a 2005 toyota corolla
2024-02-01,ejT6GwY6cSY,rngalston so reading comments makes me believe people are so poor in the west today that a new car with price tag of more than 20k is woooooha unattainable dream but those same people cant imagine closing cars boot with their own hands anymore too difficult too lazy whats going on we were traversing the arctic one day landing on the moon and so on now electric actuator has to close the boot on fiat 600
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,it looks like a lady cartoon car
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the bolt euv is much cheaper and very similar specs other than charging
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,no we cant but honestly id much rather have the jeep version id take a dodge version instead too even a chrysler version in fact anything but that front end
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,just once id like to be able to answer the question of whether this is the ev weve been waiting for with a resounding yes sadly this is another overpriced disaster with too many seats and the wait continues knowing itll happen one day isnt much comfort
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,ok so what do you actually want from an ev really
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,theelectricmonk3909i want a 1996 manual electric toyota tacoma with with a 15 cab id envision that automakers could make decent profits with an msrp of 1520k
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,theelectricmonk3909it should be small have a modern range for its size and be cost effective thats what were waiting for this is even bigger than the fiat 500e and outrageously expensive we want the wuling mini or something similar because smart have completely abandoned everything thats good about their brand the fiat 500e is too big because it has pointless back seats and is also very expensive for what it is but obviously beter than this so no this is not the ev were waiting for the dacia spring might qualify but thats still an ice age away from the uk sadly and will probably end up overpriced anyway
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,davisbradford7438 why the 1996 model out of curiosity is it some kind of classic and you want someone to convert one or do you want a brand new toyota ev that has basically the same body or something
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,jonevansauthor the vehicle doesnt need to be made by toyota the vehicle i referenced is just in high demand in the sector of agriculture i primarily work in it is lightweight has good fuel economy can carry 4 people haul a lot of equipment producevegetables roots fruit or a few animals essentially everyone i know wants this type of pickup or needs replacement hardware for it everything after the 1996 model year is much bigger less reliable
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,davisbradford7438they dont want to make unprofitable cars that are better on a macroscale
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,jonevansauthorbyd have the seagull in their home market small less than 200 miles raneg but enough for city driving its the equivalent of around 11000 in china no sign of them wanting to bring it to other markets yet unfortunately
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,nogginthenog37 yeah itd be nice to see that in the uk even with a markup there are much cheaper smaller vehicles over there that would be better but anything that undercuts the incompetent legacy auto industry would be good to have access to none of the european manufacturers are taking it seriously though
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,davisbradford7438 well that aint going to happen yet for several reasons chief among them the price of a battery is still too high for that price point unless its quite small and then the old range anxiety argument kicks in until rapid cheap and reliable chargers are as ubiquitous as gas stations smallbattery fastcharging evs are not going to sell so for now its big batteries big cost so the car has to be luxury to absorb that cost and therefore nothing truly affordable exists in the western world just yet it will happen though and probably sooner than you think just not quite yet
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,jonevansauthor i agree its not the ev weve all been waiting for it will be for some though ive never driven or ridden in the wuling mini but i have travelled in china in similarly sized ice vehicles and let me tell you now its utterly terrifying especially at proper highway speeds ok part of that is down to the chinese driving standards the only rule they religiously obey is stopping at red traffic lights literally every single other rule is regularly broken including the direction of travel on a highway its perfectly acceptable to drive on the wrong side of a highway so long as you go slowly with your hazard lights flashing if for example its a shorter way home or the other side is a bit congested but i digress but a vehicle that small and with so little crash protection would be a deathtrap in the uk if its purely city driving youre after why not look at the citroen ami ok 4 up it wont do and more than 30mph it wont do but it has the advantage of being the actual cheapest new car available in the uk 5k cheaper than the kia peanut and you can drive it on a moped licence well i say drive
2023-09-27,ejT6GwY6cSY,theelectricmonk3909 the battery argument doesnt hold much weight anymore im in the middle of a conversion for the car i referenced the cost for me as an small volume single order individual is 1002 kwh for grade a lifepo4 cells the bms low voltage system dcdc converters motor controller was 3500 this is at single item order quantities misc metal fabrication costs is roughly 1200
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,too many seats with this price it needs at least two more seats
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,moses_vii the goal is getting the car we need which with a moments thought anyone can tell is the cheapest car possible which is clearly not a fiat 600e which is a larger car than the 500e which already has four seats what we need is a fiat 400e which forgoes the rear seats and either is shorter best or just has more boot space less weight from seats no cost of seats easier to park cheaper and faster to make your idea is to make yet another three row suv which noone needs
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,the problem with electric cars is the price
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,you pay more upfront on the price of an electric car but then save on fuel and maintenance costs vs a gas car it amounts to 10002000 savings a year in the us depending on your situation id imagine the savings is even higher in areas in europe where the fuel isnt heavily subsidized like it is in the us with taxpayer dollars furthermore in the us you can get a chevrolet bolt for around 20k and a model 3 for around 32k thats literally cheaper than their competitors in the respective classes of those cars my point is the argument you made was true a few years ago but not anymore üòä
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,evane8155 no its still true now because noone is making a cheap electric car thats available worldwide and no 30k isnt remotely cheap
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,evane8155electricity in the us cost around half what it is here in europe not to mention germany which has the highest electricity cost worldwide currently owning a car ice or ev is around the same
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,problem with all new cars money is created to finance new cars new houses etc single digit margins of profit are no longer possible especially in highly competitive markets citro√´n c1 city cars are gone the vw eup was almost cancelled how cars are priced creates inflation and overtime trying to outrun inflation reducing the value of profits for executives and shareholders so they intentionally try to ensure continual successive profit and growth yoy all businessesexecutives are expected to do this and it is unsustainable not just for the market of evs bit in everything thats held captive in a market and this is evidently hollowing and burning out the earth sorry if i cant take you seriously if you just blame electric cars for being expensive and not how the big automakers created inflation havent you seen every car become posh crossovers
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,evane8155 not quite so clearcut i spend a bit over 2300 total every year on fuel maintenance insurance and i have 1 car and 2 motorcycles so maybe the car turn out to be around 1500 a year i do my own maintenance and get the cheapest insurance around get the cheapest gas too but in my case i could probably save like 1100 in fuel a year so it would take me 38000 1100 34 years for it to make any economic sense in other words it just makes no sense at all maybe for someone that is looking for a new car but if you switch to save money just no but if you want a new car the cheapest car in europe is 13000 so for it to cost more than this fiat considering it consumes the same fuel as the one i have and by the spec sheet it is very close it would take 38000 13000 1100 22 years to cost the same also makes no sense at all and i think i was generous with the fuel savings since electricity is also rather expensive i want an electric car i think they are awesome but i will most definitely wait and spend my money on other things
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,cmpc724 of course but thats where international freedom of capital tax evasion and money laundering drugs and guns sanctions and coups come in to save the day and keep the world safe under the safety of law and order democracy üòÉ
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,toyotaprius79 valid points but if they want people to stop buying ice cars then cars like this should be competing on price with something like a ford fiesta but thats still 13000 cheaper new
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,cmpc724 i referenced europe costs for fuel are higher if you did read my whole comment what are some options for cheap evs in your area and your cost differences for petrol vs electric over a year span
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,toyotaprius79 i wholeheartedly agree we need to have access to inexpensive cars that dont need all the buttons and bobs for those who dont want to pay for that and it rests on the auto industry dragging their heels by putting out the most expensive vehicles at low volumes we need governments and organizations like the united nations climate change conference to pressure if not force the industries to adapt for the future without regarding for their damn investors or company executives of course its easier said than done but we are moving in that directionslowly üôÇ
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,bentp4891the market cant solve everything i would not put faith in it this late in the game markets have to be planned and created for good what weve got are market owners who compete for market share and even influence laws and economies through politics lobbying and dinners western automakers make the conditions they want for themselves in a highly competitive market that left them vulnerable to overwhelmingly cheap ev competition they had to be caught with emissions cheating to invest in serious ev rd mazda and toyota demonstrated utter contempt that there wouldnt be a market demand for evs and now theyre panicking the chinese ev market had planned for the kind of cars ten years in advance with plenty of small affordable offerings that western brands seem unable to provide the writing has been on the wall for a decade or more
2023-09-28,ejT6GwY6cSY,especially for stellantis cars like this yet european consumers are too stupid to consider tesla renault ford and chinese cars
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,gives you an evil eye
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,i dislike cars with faces too
2023-09-26,ejT6GwY6cSY,doddsalfa i think its pretty nice car but i think id like it more without the eyes
2024-03-22,bxgXvFlt9aY,the 500e has been a sales disaster and fiat know it there even reports its having to retrofit the platform to offer hybrid variant which it should of done to begin with and this 600 as long as the hybrid is priced well itll sell well
2023-11-09,bxgXvFlt9aY,060 in 9 secs is adequate for everyday driver this was the performance of a 60s v8 pony car all the ice engine noise made it sound fast too much acceleration and torque burns up tires unsafe on slippery winter surfaces sucks up battery range encourages aggressive behavior seems expensive but ev your paying for battery that is expensive fiat trying hard to wring out costs to a middle class price the most important long term ev test is any history of spontaneous fires battery design tech replacing ice engine tech
2023-10-25,bxgXvFlt9aY,malcolmbennett4325 0 seconds ago nice car but sorry too expensive its should priced at 2k123k
2023-10-25,bxgXvFlt9aY,free us for all these retro cars
2023-10-06,bxgXvFlt9aY,very good review
2023-10-01,bxgXvFlt9aY,love love the front face look of this car thanks james like your review always üòä
2023-09-28,bxgXvFlt9aY,its overpriced and ugly two areas where fiat used to excel its a pass for me
2023-09-27,bxgXvFlt9aY,actually all the instruments and buttons first appeared on the 500e not the jeep
2023-09-24,bxgXvFlt9aY,were getting far too obsessed with 060 times in ev reviews once the preserve of top trump claims for supercars we now hold our everyday family cars to the same obsession and i dont think we should i love driving fast and acceleration is thrilling but my 13 year old laguna gets to 60 in just over 9 seconds and thats still more than quick enough for getting out in junctions when i need it to and the car is as quick as everybody elses on the daily commute 9 seconds is actually more than adequate for every day driving and if we hold every car accountable to their 060 prowess what hope is there for the future of the supercar
2023-09-25,bxgXvFlt9aY,exactly but these are eventually treated as perceived values performance size space looks and no surprise the last decade of crossovers and premium cars have created international market wide inflation not just from covid all automakers as competitors not just compete who sells more who has more market share but crucially who makes more profits this business culture financing products that are the biggest purchase second to a home creates inflation inflation reduces the value of profits dividends and bonuses therefore every competitor pushes up their prices creating more marketwide inflation you see where this goes
2023-09-23,bxgXvFlt9aY,good review batch however all stellantis seem to be doing is raiding the parts bin and then putting a new dress on the car mind you theyre not the first to do this and wont be the last im looking at you renault but even so its a bit disappointing its like the company is saying oh you dont like this outside ok how about this one etc
2023-09-25,bxgXvFlt9aY,profit profit profit inflation reduces the value of profits dividends speculative value and bonuses and they cant decide to stop growing profits competitors are competing to make more profits to attract investor money therefore prices goes up market wide and you know well that adds to inflation dont forget stellantis jeep chrysler dodge cheats their workers like the rest of them
2023-09-23,bxgXvFlt9aY,is there a pathetic fake window behind each rear door
2023-09-23,bxgXvFlt9aY,reasonable for an ev üòä
2023-09-23,bxgXvFlt9aY,batchreviews still 10 grand too much
2023-09-25,bxgXvFlt9aY,batchreviewsstop excusing it its a market wide flaw this is what delaying ev rd throughout the 2000s2010s had brought and chinese evs today are only too competitive to wipe the floor of practically every car brand tesla and toyota included
2024-05-09,HLquNEYSKWk,ikr ive seen tons of reviews calling the 600 a bigger version of the 500 rather than an update on the 500x its weird
2024-04-09,HLquNEYSKWk,good idea but disastrous as an ev as people are shunning evs
2024-04-09,HLquNEYSKWk,yepno one buying ev rubbish
2024-04-08,HLquNEYSKWk,looks like a very nice car would be even better if it had an engine
2024-03-28,HLquNEYSKWk,jesus christ is the only hope in this world no other gods will lead you to heaven there is no security or hope with out jesus christ in this world come and repent of all sins today today is the day of salvation come to the loving savior today repent and do not go to hell come to jesus christ today jesus christ is only way to heaven repent and follow him today seek his heart jesus christ can fill the emptiness he can fill the void heaven and hell is real cone to the loving savior today today is the day of salvation tomorrow might be to late come to the loving savior today holy spirit can give you peace guidance and purpose and the lord will john 31621 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life 17 for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved 18 he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god 19 and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil 20 for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved 21 but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god mark 115 15 and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel 2 peter 39 the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to usward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance hebrews 116 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him jesus
2024-03-27,HLquNEYSKWk,thanks oliver sam certainly agrees about the car not his presenting üòõ
2024-03-26,HLquNEYSKWk,prefer the 500x it has a better interior yes the infotainment screen is small compared to now but the interior of the 600 is just the jeep interior with no character the exterior is ok
2024-03-26,HLquNEYSKWk,what do you think of the design compared to the 500x it has more badges thats for sure üòÜ
2024-03-27,HLquNEYSKWk,cinch i like the exterior design just the white interior and lack of design in the exterior puts me off granted its replacing the 500x eventually but the x more design and better storage

2023-06-29,1OWaEGStiA0,youre wrong as the current fiat 500 500e sell very well in western europe
2023-07-05,1OWaEGStiA0,do you think that 25 millions fiat 500 sold in the world is a limited clientele the fiat 500 electric is the most sold car in europe in addition to being one of the most produced and sold cars the fiat 500 is also one of the most awarded cars in the world as evidenced by the more than 60 international trophies it has won over the years these also include the prestigious car of the year 2008 eurocarbody 2007 auto europa 2008 world car design of the year 2009 golden compass 2011 and the most beautiful car in the world

2024-04-06,FknVzDA15bE,totallyev second hand very reasonable 15 years old 19000 why would you buy brand new your throwing your money away
2024-04-07,FknVzDA15bE,comparing a new car to a used car is not really a fair comparison but you do you
2024-04-08,FknVzDA15bE,totallyev a car with only 6000 miles on it year and a half old is practically new i say again why would any one buy brand new
2024-03-27,FknVzDA15bE,excellent review as usual i think the 600e looks great but im waiting to see what the new fiat panda looks like and your potential review of it
2024-03-10,FknVzDA15bE,good evening totallyev im a recent subscriber and impressed with both your delivery and camera workediting im currently having a desperately tough time with a popular rival ev to the 600e which is due to be returned to its maker and very much in the hunt for a replacement ive recently road tested a smart1 and been blown away byall of it really but intrigued as to what the 600e might offer by way of a rival after watching your measured review i dont think ill be testing the 600e as it would appear not to offer the specs room or performance of the smart1 and wanted to thank you for saving me the time really enjoy the content on your channel i know its a cliche but keep up the excellent work
2024-03-11,FknVzDA15bE,thank you for the kind words glad youre enjoying the content the smart is a very well rounded vehicle and one that wed actively recommend it is however more expensive than the fiat and the ride comfort isnt as good stiffer suspension so a few things to consider
2024-03-11,FknVzDA15bE,hey thanks tev as im a motorbility customer the smart is now available on their prefered ev list so luckily cost is a side issue i can live with the ride as the quality not to mention the user interface and room is so intuitiveon another level to rivals ive tried look forward to the next uploadtotallyev
2024-03-10,FknVzDA15bE,thank you for the indepth review again impeccable as usual
2024-03-10,FknVzDA15bE,30k is not affordable in my opinion the fact that even on a 100kwh dc charger it would still take 30 mins to charge from 20 to 80 for a couple of hundred miles my car can top up in less than a few minutes and do over 600 miles and my car only cost me 1500 used many years ago and i could still sell it for 1500 or even more now
2024-03-10,FknVzDA15bE,pleased for you and what car is that
2024-03-10,FknVzDA15bE,keep your car as long as it makes sense buy a second hand ev when they become affordable and total ownership cost is on par or better than you current car
