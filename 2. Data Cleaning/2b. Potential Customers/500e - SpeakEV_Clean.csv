2023-08-17,https://www.speakev.com/threads/what-charging-cables-come-with-the-fiat-500e-icon.166541/post-3177426,hi there i have ordered a fiat 500e icon on lease which will come in march i had ordered a 208 gt premium petrol but they have had a recall on the car and delivery will be god knows when and i need to make sure i had a car for when my current lease went back end of march to startmid april so i took the plunge as i wanted a ev i do not drive far tbh and this car was really the only one i could afford at the time i ordered it about a week agoother cars have prices raised alot and alot of cars and petrol ones have 8 weeks delivery some i have seen 6 months wait lol anyway for the time being i will not be getting a home charger as the prices of them are ridiculous i am sure they are charging way way over the odds for them 7001200 there have been a few for 549 etc but these are with the grant off which if i tried to order now would be too late anyway as they do not have slots for instillation before the grant ends and so id be paying full priceliterally can not afford it plus i am pretty sure we would need something upgraded with the main fuse too i plan on using public chargers there is a pub near me that has a free 50kw charger long as you are in the pub me and my friend meet once a month for fee and usually in there atleast 3 hrs talking so it should give decent range and there are others locally that you pay for but still cheaper than petrol i do not mind using a granny cable at home for inbetween tbh anyway the question is what cables come with the car as in the description it just stays charging cable mode 3 would that be the 7kw one where you can either plug it into a home wall charger and public chargers that are 7kw do you get the granny cable at all as i do not fancy paying 170 for one many thanks

2017-02-13,https://www.speakev.com/threads/heat-pump-and-defogging.57409/post-2696277,hi all i was thinking about the use of heat pumps in evs yesterday and something occurred to me a heat pump is a great idea for reducing energy consumption of the heater a cop coefficient of performance of 3 to 4 is typical for a heat pump at least when the outside temperature is above about 10c this means you get about 3 to 4 times the heat output compared to electrical input so a resistance heater like the one in my ion which is 5kw when going flat out uses 5kw of energy a heat pump could produce 5kw of heat from as little as 1250 1600 watts which is a major win of course there are drawbacks too a resistance heater is simple and bullet proof while a heat pump is just an ac system going in reverse so has all the same failure mechanisms such as failing compressor gas leaks potential damage to the evapcondensor from road debris etc also below about 10c they get less and less effective and may need the assistance of a resistance heater at very low canadian winter temperatures although probably not a big issue here in the uk these tradeoffs are well known but another one occurred to me how do you defog the windscreen effectively in really wethumid conditions around 512 degrees if you cant run both the heater and ac at the same time in a conventional ice or an ev with a resistance heater you can run both heater and ac at the same time the air first passes through the ac and is cooled removing moisture and then passes through the heater to be warmed up again resulting in warm dry air that will remove even the worst fog like a magic wand although it saps the battery badly i sometimes find myself forced to run the ac and heater together on low in my ion to keep the windows clear of fog and of course its second nature to do this in my ice where the heater is free and ac has little effect on range but if you have a heat pump system in your ev do you just have a single dual purpose evaporatorcondenser behind the dashboard that switches roles by reversing the pump depending on whether you want heating or cooling in which case it is impossible to both cool to remove moisture the airflow and then heat it up again at the same time or is there an ancillary resistance heater that you can turn on at the same time that the heat pump is in ac mode but at great energy expense im interested to know how you find defogging your windows if you have a car with a heat pump system and whether there is indeed a range sapping ancillary resistance heater that needs to be put into action to both cool and heat at the same time or whether you just find it more difficult to defog your windows in wet humid conditions

2022-01-17,https://www.speakev.com/threads/car-manufacturers-and-dc-charge-curves.177296/post-3431028,dumfriesdik said as a noob i am aware that charge curves chargers and bevs are in a world of dark art and are intrinsically linked having charged on a public charger just a couple of times we did get over 55kw for a bit is it possible for a 50kw charger to deliver 50kw to cars with a higher recharge ability ie 120kw and how likely will that happen  no a 50kw charger will be limited to approximately 50kw driving an id3 all you really need to remember is that to get the best charge speed you need to arrive at the charging station with low soc as low as you are comfortable aiming for and outside of mid summer you need to have been driving for a while at a decent speed to build up some heat in the battery a couple of hours at 70 is usually enough for me the algorithm that determines allowable charge speed seems to be quite complicated though there is no point using a single curve to try to predict what you should expect the absolute maximum possible is about 135kw after which it will retain above 100kw to 2930 gradually dropping but if you plug in at say 25 you will never see more than 8090kw of course this is often absolutely fine if you are getting a coffee etc if you see a charger advertised as 150kw in my experience you will get what the id3 can take as discussed above some are limited to 250a which would be about 105kw in an id3 but most arent and in an id3 thats pretty good anyway if you pick a 120kw charger though its highly likely to be limited to 200a which is about 8085kw in an id3 if you have arrived at very low soc hoping for 120kw that would be annoying

2014-12-12,https://www.speakev.com/threads/the-5-000-mile-a-year-lease.161438/post-3065875,these days i drive almost no miles i mean i regard it as almost none i have a 4 mile commute that i could walk in less than an hour if i really needed to and if it wasnt for the 80 mile familyvisit trip i do once a fortnight or longer i probably would do just that and walk it yet that still adds up to 6000 miles plus the vey rare bits of shopping and an outing to a national trust or such im not particularly sociable so really next to no excess mileage above that i can look to be doing about 7000 a year at the moment for basically no miles a year from my pov so my question of the hour why do people even bother to get a car if a 5000 miles a year lease would cover their needs its always struck me and i feel it is as true now as when i said it in the age of 22kwh cars if you do too few miles an ev is likely too expensive and not worth it and if you do too many then an ev wont suit bevs live in a range of golden miles and as i have alluded to in other threads not only on cost but also on co2 grounds right now this precise moment it makes more sense for me personally to stick with an efficient euro 6 diesel im not in that golden zone of miles that makes bev a particularly sensible option im not wanting to debate the relative calculations and for someone looking for a new car and in different circumstances they will have different needs and outcomes but the thrust of my thesis here is that anyone who only needs 5k miles a year probably doesnt need any miles at all id have said these days with batteries as they are if you are doing 12k to 15k miles a year youd be pretty dumb not to go for a bev 15k to 30k a bev will pay in spades if it covers your particular mileage or you probably could do with a phev to eek out the dino juice or above 30k really it is an ice for you at 5k to 12k it will depend very much on your circumstances if you already have a car whether it makes sense to swap it out like mine short trips with occasional long or regular 50 mile round trip commute ice or bev is usually fairly clear 5k get a bike

2020-02-05,https://www.speakev.com/threads/battery-100-myth-or-reality.178856/post-3468563,padrino said i dont really think that this is clear cut and dry situation perhaps this was an issue at the beginning of the ev era today is a different picture all together they are a few forums tesla mainly with discussion about battery life and degradation over the pond they have virtually thousands upon thousands cars with over 300k on the clocks and average degradation for this sort of a mileage is about 12 i personally wouldnt be worried too much for a start almost all ev manufacturers are offering 810 years and 100k miles warranty on drive train and batteries this is a lot more than any ice car for a start if the manufacturers are confident enough to provide this kind of cover for me this is indication that the expectations are for at least another 5060k miles on top of the 100k offered as warranty just drive the damn thing and dont worry too much  you are right except that charging is a frequently discussed and pretty infected subject even on other forums not just tesla i am on a bmw i4 also and it can get pretty hot over there as well unless you agree with the mainstream which is literally never go below 20 and never charge above 80 of course that is nonsense but there are many who believe that those values are some sort of brick wall my logic says the same as your logic even if my battery is degraded by 1015 after 100k miles that will take many years and if in say 510 years time my range will drop by 1015 well who cares if the range drops too much ie noticeably lower then there is the battery warranty anyway
