2024-05-04,0kDbvxpjLZs,9 seconds for an electric car thats especially pathetic
2024-02-16,0kDbvxpjLZs,good honest review thanks like the car im in australia cant wait to test drive one üòÖ
2024-01-06,0kDbvxpjLZs,this is a genius car this is a car that you dont buy but you lease to your company
2023-10-21,0kDbvxpjLZs,got a twinair mito done 60k in it its great thing that puts me off this is that italians aint the best when it comes to automotive electrics so id be tentative about trusting them to build a electric car thats reliable in the long term especially when its their 1st stab at it stellantis has already has already issued recalls for a bunch of its evs so as cool as this is i dont feel like being a guinea pig just saying
2023-09-16,0kDbvxpjLZs,no spare wheel is a dealbreaker i love that gap between the low centre console and the dashboard thoughit looks like it would be super easy to scoot from one side of the car to the other which is extremely practical
2023-08-17,0kDbvxpjLZs,i love this car
2023-06-01,0kDbvxpjLZs,i absolutely hate those big entertainment screens in cars they are not necessary
2023-04-28,0kDbvxpjLZs,why are you driving in the middle of the road
2023-04-06,0kDbvxpjLZs,712 strangely aroused at this pointanywayconcentratetax returnsmother teresathats better back to the review
2022-09-03,0kDbvxpjLZs,why not compare this to the 500e that was produced between 2013 to 2019
2022-09-03,0kDbvxpjLZs,i have not got apple car play in my 500 icon
2022-09-03,0kDbvxpjLZs,it will not do 199 miles i own one and have had it for 16 months i have driven it like a baby carrage and the most i can get is 160 miles
2022-08-28,0kDbvxpjLZs,imagine if someone could make a cheap and simple ev that only costs 2000 oh wait that is exactly what some factories are making because the whole point of ev is simplicity and they are therefore cheap but buying it here while it was possible in the past the cost was inflated to nearly 10k and the law now prevents anything being sold unless it means pricing out most of population
2022-07-18,0kDbvxpjLZs,what a great reviewer love her wit humour
2022-07-09,0kDbvxpjLZs,the butten to open the door is it electric can you open it with no power
2022-07-04,0kDbvxpjLZs,nice car but not with an acre of cheap piano black plastic to stare at makes my skin crawl nope
2022-06-23,0kDbvxpjLZs,no thanks keep the electric version only takes away from the rear hatch nonspace and yes i own a 500 with no rear seating space i use the area for extra cargo room no way is electricity viable here in the usa not enough charging stations and retrofitting my home would be an insanely cost issue thanks for the fun video
2022-06-21,0kDbvxpjLZs,very best car i love
2022-06-20,0kDbvxpjLZs,plz fiat launch this car in india
2022-06-18,0kDbvxpjLZs,just passing by locking for a review what is this theater are you talking to a bunch of 5 year olds i get faulty towers vibes but without the irony fire the script maker please
2022-06-06,0kDbvxpjLZs,i love the fiat 31 but its not available in the us üôÅ
2022-05-31,0kDbvxpjLZs,the rear 3red door is not availabe in the uk for safety reasons as you british people love to drive on the wrong side of the road the passengers would leave the car on the traffic side and you have the socalled leftfootproblem where to rest your unemployed left foot sorry folks same reason üôÇ and for the boot you are talking nonsense there it is enough space for four small 3 midsize two normal oe 1 big suitcase three small suittcasres 2 of them lying flat and piled the third upright on the side sorry again in a well pepared check yo would use some different sized suitcases to combine cable problem you can buy a frunk from an austrien firm for 210 euros or you leave the dc cable at home because you will hardly eveer need it the charging stations work with their own cables so you just plug it in the granny cable is for home charging on a wallsocket schuko in german
2022-05-31,0kDbvxpjLZs,too bad the charge port is on the bad side to access teslas superchargers it would have been nice automakers to chose a side not repeating the issue ice cars have
2022-05-30,0kDbvxpjLZs,i live in north america and their not coming here what a shame because ive got a 2013 and i love it and the electric one looks great
2022-04-25,0kDbvxpjLZs,i love the 500ev i would get the passion i would get the entry level action but it doesnt have a radio dab system
2022-04-23,0kDbvxpjLZs,dogging round the surrey hills thinking of buying my mrs one as she is not allowed to drive my aston
2022-04-18,0kDbvxpjLZs,i also reviewed the fiat 500e in my channel i must say its very promising strong identity and style but it suffers the same problem as most evs the price and not enough options i also feel like a lot was invested into style than interior practicality
2022-04-16,0kDbvxpjLZs,regarding the creepy off sound if you play the on and the off sounds one after the other you will listen in a simplified version of course the first notes of the soundtrack of amarcord a 1973 movie by the famous italian director federico fellini written by the most talented italian composer nino rota well worth listening i wish the car played a little bit more of it
2022-04-01,0kDbvxpjLZs,my shopping cart is bigger
2022-03-31,0kDbvxpjLZs,why would you say you own a fiat 500 30 times in a video its not a good joke its not even remotelly fun maybe once maybe twice 30 times is just eye rolling
2022-03-11,0kDbvxpjLZs,i own 1 i love it several people walked up to me to tell so cute and personality in abundance good for long distances as well 433 km and only 1 charge in 24 mins on a fast charger lets say a coffee break
2022-03-03,0kDbvxpjLZs,despite the occasionally annoying presentation style its a reasonable summary reasonable but not totally accurate as a very happy 500e owner i can offer the following range im only getting an average of 36 mileskwh so 144 miles and this is always using range mode for max regen and driving normally on a mix of road types driving is fun and the car is both nippy and confident my other car is a bmw i3 and the 500e actually tracks better interior i wasam pleasantly impressed with the build quality and most of the materials quality theres one of one exceptions but allinall its very good again my benchmark is a bmw practicality well its a fiat 500 for goodness sake and nobody should be expecting a tardis having said that its more than capable of taking our large weekly shop or carryon luggage for two again people its a city car specs i have the la prima model so topoftherange the specs are pretty amazing with very driver assistance gizmo you could wish for honestly the only thing missing is folding door mirrors but i guess the car is regarded as narrow enough for this to be a moot point i would definitely recommend people considering a city car ev to take one for test drive
2022-04-18,0kDbvxpjLZs,in my channel i reviewed the fiat 500e as well i can confirm you have a good point your points are valid i agree with you almost everywhere but there is one major flaw the price for that price we all have expectations i personally wouldve expected a tardislike experience if i were to pay beyond 30k euros for an asegment car for 30k one could get a csegment like a golf or astra car which is similar to the 500e in terms of city friendliness but more easy to live with
2022-06-14,0kDbvxpjLZs,autochampwandelen well price or more accurately value is all in the mind of the buyer for me i believe the 500e delivers much for the price i paid and the sales numbers reflect that this is a commonenough view the level of tech the impressive build quality and the sense of style all combine to deliver a valuable package a car purchase any car purchase is a discretionary spend so value is totally subjective
2022-06-14,0kDbvxpjLZs,autochampwandelen one more thing on price you mentioned golf and astra neither a pure ev platforms and so the comparison is moot additionally many of the legacy manufacturers when offering an ev version of their compromise vehicle architectures will spec and price the ev at the highest end of the range ice will be available with an entrylevel specprice but not the ev option fiat with the 500e do at least offer all termspecprice levels making the ev accessible to a broader customer base and that has to be a good thing
2022-03-02,0kDbvxpjLZs,its electric disqusting oh no its even automatic you people are sick dafuk is wrong with you
2022-03-30,0kDbvxpjLZs,love the fact you needed to mention its an automatic after mentioning its electric likeduuuurrrrr
2022-02-26,0kDbvxpjLZs,i loved my abarth would love to see them do a high performance ev version then bring it back to the us
2022-02-25,0kDbvxpjLZs,fabulous review and the reviewer has buckets of charisma really entertaining
2022-02-24,0kDbvxpjLZs,i have this car and i absolutely love it you dont notice the chime after a while an amazing car to drive definitely worth looking into one
2022-08-08,0kDbvxpjLZs,im thinking of getting one of these what sort of range do you actually get from it motorway and city thanks
2022-02-22,0kDbvxpjLZs,a charismatic car and a charismatic reviewer great review thanks
2022-02-21,0kDbvxpjLZs,the basic version highway range is under 100 miles this version is more expensive than the abarth 1 abarth for me please
2022-02-21,0kDbvxpjLZs,way way over priced fiat originally brought out the 500 and designed it for people with average incomes now we are trying to get everyone in to evs fiat instead of building an ev for the average person brings out something for wealthier people 25k plus is way too pricey nah
2022-02-20,0kDbvxpjLZs,no mention of the very reduced range in the winter due to the effect of cold on battery and need to use the climate control but it is a lovely car to drive
2022-02-18,0kDbvxpjLZs,too expensive for such a small car with such a short battery range
2022-02-18,0kDbvxpjLZs,the car looks nice but i dont think a small car needs all the gadgets connectivity and infotainment they should keep them simple and efficient
2022-02-17,0kDbvxpjLZs,i bought a fiat 500e passion in rose gold two months ago and it is a belter of a car with bags of power great build quality and a brilliant driving experience particularly in onepedal drive mode it replaced a renault twingo gt which had identical dimensions so the boot and cabin are large enough for me and it also fits into my garage thanks to the piano keys that operate the hvac system the tablet remains off as i have no use for it and prefer to enjoy the pleasing sound of the electric motor
2022-04-24,0kDbvxpjLZs,hi brian how do you find the battery life to mileage and the charging time
2022-04-24,0kDbvxpjLZs,fc4660 hi f c over the winter i averaged about 38 miles per kwh in mixture of town and 5060 mph main road driving all with a light foot this has recently risen to 425 miles per kwh during early spring so range is now about 160 miles i have read that the fiat can be charged at 85 kw on public fast chargers but i have only ever used my home wallbox which is set very low to match my solar pv systems output so it is currently costing me very little to run hope this is of some help
2022-02-17,0kDbvxpjLZs,just not a fan of the fiat 500
2022-02-17,0kDbvxpjLZs,i drive a prima convertible in lhd formatlove it for what it is but there are some down pointsrhd conversion has not been done well it is a 22 range is great for city and day trips but it is not practical for any long range trips eg touring holidays mine is in a two car family and fits well but would i have got it as my only car probably not
2022-02-17,0kDbvxpjLZs,ive always liked the 500 and this is a good review but it captures in a nutshell the huge problem we have with evs right now price and range the most basic 500e is nearly 10k more than the entry petrol version thats 25k for a very small basic low range car and that climbs to 30k for a higher spec model thirty grand this is why evs are mostly being bought by the well off at the moment people who will always have a second ice car for longer journeys where theyre still way more practical were still 5 years or more away from sensibly priced evs with better battery tech
2022-02-17,0kDbvxpjLZs,buying on a contract and saving the difference between the petrol and ev version on fuel bills makes it cost effective
2022-02-17,0kDbvxpjLZs,jonwetherell5214 possibly with a very small car but this is the argument everyone makes buy on contract at this price though even with a moderate deposit youre looking at 3400 per month for a fiat 500e which is crazy kia ev6 midspec on pcp deal is around 7800pm this is just totally impractical for most average buyers especially with many now struggling just to keep the heating on and put food on the table with electicity prices soaring its also going to get more expensive to charge evs too
2022-02-23,0kDbvxpjLZs,jonwetherell5214 you having a laugh renting cars
2022-04-18,0kDbvxpjLZs,i also reviewed the fiat 500e in my channel and i can definitely confirm price and lack of options and practicality is an issue for that price you could get a csegment car that is more spacious and practical to live with and still as city friendly as the fiat 500e
2022-02-17,0kDbvxpjLZs,boot size is fine for most people tbh
2022-02-17,0kDbvxpjLZs,i still love my 2015 500c makes me happy every time i drive it
2022-02-16,0kDbvxpjLZs,nice car irritating presenter
2022-02-16,0kDbvxpjLZs,i love the 500 a small city car that is happy being a small city car great review much nicer interior quality and the specs are so good for what it is going to be used for although u are paying more now the 500 makes a great electric city car for the millions of people without loads of kids and large shopping trips etc because we do exist we need more manufacturers thinking like this
2022-02-16,0kDbvxpjLZs,nicola is again superbly delivering car reviews
2022-05-30,0kDbvxpjLZs,but she failed to mention a that strange push button gearbox b no handbrake for hill starts c gas pedal that stop and go without using the brake pedal which i hope there is a brake pedal must test drive one before i buy
2022-02-16,0kDbvxpjLZs,this car suits nicola so much ahaha love the reviews as per usual
2022-02-16,0kDbvxpjLZs,good reviewüôÇ although im not sold on electric vehicles when we dont have enough charging points at the moment hybrid makes more sense when most cars take at least a few hours to charge the city charge points wont make sense this is why utility bills are going up trying to run before we can walk electricity isnt a greener energy source powercuts blackouts will be a regular occurrence
2022-02-16,0kDbvxpjLZs,this is a common misconception and the national grid disagrees with you two thirds of uk homeowners have access to a driveway and therefore a home charger they can charge at night making use of a currently under utilised electricity availability from wind power add in solar panels and storage from used ev batteries not to mention vehicletogrid where cars charge when prices are low and sell their cars electricity to the grid when prices are high and you can see there really is no shortage it is not why utility bills are going up you really need to do yourself a favour and google why they are going up the charging infrastructure could do with improvement though i agree with that
2022-02-17,0kDbvxpjLZs,not currently available in the uk unfortunately
2022-02-16,0kDbvxpjLZs,she showed the boot without showing the boot
2022-02-16,0kDbvxpjLZs,oh no you said you hate your car thats just a sure way of making her sulk on you üòüüòü

2022-02-17,0kDbvxpjLZs,the electric powertrain
2022-02-17,0kDbvxpjLZs,carbuyer that has been out in december 2020
2022-02-17,0kDbvxpjLZs,mini gets a much shorter range but is more fun to drive the cupra is much more expensive
2022-02-17,0kDbvxpjLZs,carbuyer yes but i think its worth it i love the mazda mx30 as well
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,great review again my wife loves hers and the dog likes the back seat great fun to drive but if like me you have size 12 feet theres no room under the brake on uks rhd version you can buy a frunk insert for under the bonnet from a company in germany it carries the cable and a few bits cheers you should get fiat to give you one as a long termer httpsyoutubexi4qdkjgqnk
2022-03-03,0kDbvxpjLZs,thanks for the pointer to the frunk might look to get one i swapped out the domestic slow charger in the boot for a type 2 cable i never intend to charge at 2kwh while outandabout but i like how the frunk can also take some of the other roadside paraphernalia
2022-02-17,0kDbvxpjLZs,i really really like them looks great on this car
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,the car that saved fiat from bankruptcy
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,great review nicola fiat should consider a new electric panda
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,for a little bit more money you can get a tesla model 3 with nearly double the range better speed all the nice stuff and more i see the small size point but the car feels overpriced i assume the prices for model 3 will even fall once the berlin factory is running i think fiat still needs to level up a lot in order to be competitive
2022-02-17,0kDbvxpjLZs,if you actually go to the tesla website youll see the very cheapest tesla model 3 is 44990 purchase price the performance model the one with the good acceleration is 59990 these prices are before any optional extras are added thats not a bit more money
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,i went to guernsey in the summer the place is full of fiat 500s so this should go down well nicola get yours over there someone might take it off your hands
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,u tube have upped the number and length of time for adverts that i find it so hard to enjoy watching these videos shame as this was so informative and enjoyable to watch
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,i think this looks great and i hate the previous gen car 30k for a 500 is too much though
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,thank you for a great review nicola the new lights do indeed resemble eye lids and the lack of grille harks back to the original 500 that if i recall correctly had what seemed a spare engine in the boot an electric door release is form over function for an electric car though draining a few extra lumps from the battery may not be ideal id hope there is a clear manual release somewhere after all if your tired and pull over with the heater on and drop off into a deep snooze youll want to be able to get out when you wake up to err powder your nose the sherpa mode seems to have been around on cars for decades regularly driving on faster country roads i often find a stream of cars queueing behind a careful driver not that it bothers me that much honestly it doesnt bother me at all really im really not bothered ok i have to agree that horror jingle makes me shudder definitely at night if you live near a certain 24 hour fast food chain i loved the comment about moaning in the drivers ear how much you hate it in the rear of the car now as for sausage dogs i love em under breaking they might have a tendency to roll off end end up under the front seats and that dachshund extraction procedure can be an event in itself oh and i cant remember if you might have said that you have the older 500 but if it seems like massive difference in nearly all aspects to the review car remember your car has character and you should continue to love it even after a mild moan or tantrum
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,what a detailed comment love it oh and incase you were wondering i have a rear seat dog hammock thing which means theyre comfy and strapped in with their seatbelts thankyou for watching x
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,halogen headlights really fiat
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,i own the previous generation model in sport trim with the twinair engine and its an absolute hoot to drive so im definitely curious about what the electric model would offer should the time to move on from the twinair come and it looks promising smashing review
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,you should try it steven and let us know how you get on
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,and the hybrid has been described as the laziest hybrid in the sector with a 12volt battery under the passenger seat that wont do much other than allow fiat to put a hybrid badge outside
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,carbuyer great little car though i had the panda with the 12 engine and kept it for 10 years went everywhere in it basic motoring at its best fab review great to see the ev
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,thats all nice and cool but i feel like a dimension goes missing when they turned the 500 into an ev the sound from the engine i always thought it was kinda charming and funny sounding idk loving these reviews tho
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,ah we know what you mean especially that thrummy twinair engine but honestly you dont miss it at all
2022-02-16,0kDbvxpjLZs,carbuyer maybe not im not looking for an ev at the moment im way too emotionally invested with my volvo but i might go for a test drive in a 500 it looks fun
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,michelebicc6983 that begs the question of what the point of the button was in the first place
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,carbuyer hidden safety features are awesome
2022-02-15,0kDbvxpjLZs,great review thanks
2024-04-01,N3PcV-_kLR8,at 6 i was surprised with its space and seat comfort id buy one for its fun city manourvability id prefer no back seat but rather a platform with a couple of lockboxes as i have dogs id also like to see electric memory seats linked to the fobs as found in our honda crv as my wife i are not the same height cheers from nz
2024-02-22,N3PcV-_kLR8,the convertible section should have been designed to fold inside the boot door
2023-12-04,N3PcV-_kLR8,also worth noting of allllll the convertibles out there the fiat is the best combination of comfort and price i test drove every convertible available in usa under 75k none of them came close to the comfort of the fiat even the mazda miata is so low and tight fit that it would not be a comfortable choice for daily driver mustang and corvette are also uncomfortable add to that the typical ev is uggggggly and none of them come in convertible fiat 500 electricconvertible game changer
2023-10-25,N3PcV-_kLR8,october 2023 fiat 500e club on facebook the high voltages in an ev requires mechanics to have safety training and special equipment may be needed in fact my nearest fiat dealer cant service my la prima because of lack of training and equipment
2023-09-08,N3PcV-_kLR8,a prima version of this was parked next to my i3 just yesterday absolutely gorgeouslooking car üòé
2023-09-08,N3PcV-_kLR8,never have and never will like the fiat 500 in any form a truly awful car in my opinion
2023-09-07,N3PcV-_kLR8,it would be a perfect carif it had a normal engine
2023-09-07,N3PcV-_kLR8,we had the ice version a few years ago as a hire car and i cant explain how much fun it was fast no loud yes hilarious 100 i was apprehensive about using it as a hire car but after two weeks travelling about europe we were gutted to hand the keys back
2023-09-07,N3PcV-_kLR8,stunning little car and you have room in the boot for some shopping with your milk
2023-09-07,N3PcV-_kLR8,love the look of this car must have a reverse camera
2023-09-07,N3PcV-_kLR8,i just seen a 500e parked beside a 2000s nissan almera and the almera was smaller thats not good
2023-09-07,N3PcV-_kLR8,i swear cars are getting huge example nissan micra the name doesnt describe the car anymore
2023-11-26,N3PcV-_kLR8,duraeble2 inflated cars make better profits for shareholders more profits means more price hikes throughout the entire competition industry and market inflation reduces the value of profit margins and so the boulder tumbles
2023-05-05,pCbZhz5GRmg,hilariously i have driven this exact car was for sale at my old dealership i worked at small world
2022-06-14,pCbZhz5GRmg,well this video is noot actual any more because there is no action after 422 it is now called icon 22 and it is rather a cheap version of that new icon 22 it has the smaller battery but a lot of icon equipment so as the bigger screen the dab radio and the uconnect5 and there are more options than before to choose from for example the split back seat if i had known that before i might have waited because the old action was too poorly equipped it is now a better alternative than before the price has risen for about 1200 in germany an even better choice than before because it is nearly as equipped as an icon best choice now if the range is nor so important
2022-03-10,pCbZhz5GRmg,question do you know if there are any fiat 500 electric motor adapters available to purchase im looking to put an hpevs ac50 with a 120v 650amp controller need an adapter i have everything else
2022-02-10,pCbZhz5GRmg,no youll struggle to resell the 24kwh version spring for the 42kwh battery with the more powerful motor its worth the extra
2022-01-31,pCbZhz5GRmg,poor you no heated seats and nought to sixty in only nine seconds what do you think i dont think anyone cares do something else let someone who is good at car reviews do it we dont want your silly little likes and dislikes
2021-10-26,pCbZhz5GRmg,them pants are ridiculous huggy bear fom starsky and hutch car usless just a toy car copy 70s adult size cars aswell huggy
2021-09-24,pCbZhz5GRmg,i choose the bigger battery the passion i adore this little car i will call it my cicciolina üòò
2021-09-09,pCbZhz5GRmg,20k pounds is 277k usd nearly 28k and it doesnt come with cruise control or heated seats seriously fiat get your ish together i am sure the wiring harnesses are identical for models with and without cruise they cant possibly be saving more than a few bucks per car by not including either
2021-08-30,pCbZhz5GRmg,weve had the la prima for 6 daysits now parked up in our garage we cant use it its illegal to use on uk roads as it doesnt have the slow moving pedestrian warning sound its not even listed on the menu safety and security and our insurer refuses to provide cover other than fire and theft so if you have one of these and its missing the sound you not insured to drive on uk or eu roads you have been warned
2021-08-29,pCbZhz5GRmg,no wonder manufacturers are pushing all electric 50100 more expensive than their ice equivalents
2021-08-18,pCbZhz5GRmg,those options are pricey the already high price just makes it even more expensive
2021-08-14,pCbZhz5GRmg,i prefer cloth seats ngl better in summer and dont really need heated seats in winter never used heated seats and steering wheel also with my lifestyle id need the bigger battery
2021-08-13,pCbZhz5GRmg,10 plastic from the sea recycling that amount from ocean plastic would cost more than the touch screen and more make your research that is green wash from fiat
2021-08-11,pCbZhz5GRmg,i believe this is the right size for electric cars i cannot believe theres people that buys humongous 50k electric suvs with a 300km top range that defeats the need of a big car in the first place small cars are perfect in city commutes cos theres going to be a charging point somewhere were you can plug it in for the night and with what you save you can rent a car to go further if fancy strikes you prices need to lower though
2021-08-01,pCbZhz5GRmg,i went and had a test drive in the la prima spec of this car yesterday after watching this review was absolutely shocked at just how cheap and plasticky it felt inside drove okay looked good from the outside but jees just so cheap on the inside
2021-07-12,pCbZhz5GRmg,one of the best reviews so far
2021-06-30,pCbZhz5GRmg,heated seats are a must for electric cars
2021-06-30,pCbZhz5GRmg,ideal for a city subscription car rentals
2021-06-30,pCbZhz5GRmg,if this comes up on leaseloco with zero down payment at under 180 per month ill bite their hand off as a 2nd car
2021-06-30,pCbZhz5GRmg,id defo opt for that winter pack heated seats and steering wheel is a must once youve had it
2021-06-30,pCbZhz5GRmg,if this was 16k base spec id say yes its worth it still pricey at 20k for bare bones car
2021-06-25,pCbZhz5GRmg,good review will get a 500 for my wifes local runs it looks great is easy to drivepark but will go for a higher spec model the action is a bit sparse its range too low
2021-06-25,pCbZhz5GRmg,i believe the extra 4k is definitely worth it i just think that 20k for no screen at all is extremely stingy even the eup has a screen and the decreased range will take a massive toll say if you are travelling long distance you will have to be stopping every hour or so
2021-06-15,pCbZhz5GRmg,i just drove one today and was disappointed the infotainment system is terrible cluttered menu and counterintuitive and having buttons to select the gear is an idea you need to have a very peculiar mind to find useful the indicator arm was mechanical and often remains in the active position after you complete the turn the navigation was slow and fiddly unless youre a family of midgets or your passengers are pugs the backseat is only for show its hard to see where the car ends both ends the lane assist was worse than driving with an anxious motherinlaw in the backseat the worst thing was the lack of mechanical door opening to get out of the car you press a button so make sure you never run the battery to zero or you will need to break a window to escape the positives good acceleration and nice dashboard the size is of course convenient but thats common for all small cars two usb ports but the old usb2 standard instead of usbc which is the new standard and a proper space for your phone good size cup holders and the glove compartment was decent for the car size the seats were comfortably firm all in all i think this is a car that will appeal much more to women than to men they may find its quirks more charming than utilitarian men
2021-06-12,pCbZhz5GRmg,i love the 15 inch wheels that trend to keep installing larger and larger wheels in any car is just ridiculous not even sports cars need 19 20 21 inch wheels let alone your daybyday grocery getter
2021-06-11,pCbZhz5GRmg,my wife had a fiat 500 petrol and then a semi automatic because the position of the accelerator and clutch gave her terrible leg ache it also did the same thing to me i hated it it was too bouncy pulled to the kerb was gutless with no boot to speak of to top it all off it was bloody expensive and the electric version will outprice itself when other makes come on line
2021-06-11,pCbZhz5GRmg,did you turn off the fake engine sound i couldnt hear it
2021-06-09,pCbZhz5GRmg,finally a car that is heading in the right direction as a second car perfect and the lack of technology is for me a very good thing once the dealer incentives kick in a nearly new one of these will be well under 20k very cool
2021-06-09,pCbZhz5GRmg,well dont go shopping with little shits then u will also have the back seats for xtra shopping luv üòÄ
2021-06-09,pCbZhz5GRmg,i bought a fiat panda ten years ago for 5995 with a range of 300 miles and a refill time of 10 minutes or less progress
2021-06-17,pCbZhz5GRmg,it takes me 12 seconds to charge my electric car six seconds to plug it in at night before i go to bed and another six seconds to unplug it the morning when i get up i usually do this every 8 to 9 days oh i really miss standing in a puddle of spilt diesel having to hold a filthy fuel nozzle in place until the car is full ive not been near a petrol station for two years im welling up at the memory
2021-06-09,pCbZhz5GRmg,sorry not good value my wife only 3 years ago bought a new limited edition mazda mx5 rag top full infotainment systemheated seats auto lights and wipers hill start assist reversing sensors cruise control blah blah 21900 plus of course one of the best roadsters on the market if i want cheap id look at dacia aka renault the price difference between one of those and the fiat buys a huge mountain of fuel and it wont run out of juice after just 80 or 90 miles
2021-06-19,pCbZhz5GRmg,how strange you areput up a pic of your food prep area
2021-06-07,pCbZhz5GRmg,does it have a heat pump or not can you please include this information in all your reviews thanks
2021-06-06,pCbZhz5GRmg,if you want cute and dont mind owning fiat quality ok but if you want the same range maybe a bit more all year round buy a low mileage leaf 30kwh for half the price
2021-06-06,pCbZhz5GRmg,still too expensivecompetition from other manufacturers should influence the prices in the futurenot for me at that price
2021-06-04,pCbZhz5GRmg,maybe this should be considered which will be far cheaper and more effective battery technology currently is still hopelessly inadequate unfortunately httpswwwmotorcyclenewscomnewsnewtechsyntheticpetrol
2021-06-04,pCbZhz5GRmg,i wish i could afford it i can barely pay rent i want this car so very badly
2021-06-04,pCbZhz5GRmg,im sorry but back to basics is the security equipment power steering air conditioning and central locking this is unnecessarily equiped with loads of stuff that just add price and could be solved including the screen with less apps its a more rational usage of resources and even a cost saving solution that is very easy to lower the final price this care is definitely not worthy
2021-06-09,pCbZhz5GRmg,sadly a lot of the kit it comes with is mandated by the eu these days as standard safety equipment so it has to have it no matter what granted that adds to the price and does explain that new new cars will be more expensive then a car designed even 12 years ago the uk agreed to accept the eu standards as part of brexit so it will be the same here too
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,cute but always get the highest range models not here in usa yet but interested in it theses reviews are short and mostly on smooth roads the new ev version is a few inches longer than the the previous one my old scion iq is still champ at parking 10 feet vs 12 feet perfect city car my little iq has a ice though so not limited by charging stations just gas its been all over ca including death valley now that would be a fun test for the new 500
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,ussless electric till they make one that goseover 500 miles no use as travle lots and not many charge points no use at all and cant have in flats no points anywere tocharge them so basicly no point there nive but not good forlots just a few that i have spoken to
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,such a great looking car more penfold than dangermouse üòÅ
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,personally dont think the reduction in cost is enough to justify the smaller battery and reduced range as well as the paired back spec drop the list price to sub 18k and fiat are on to a winner
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,finally somebody who prefers not to have leather seats
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,considering you can twist the arm of an mg dealer and get a zs ev excite for that price and have a tonne more spec space and decent bit more range
2021-06-04,pCbZhz5GRmg,no the entry level costs 35000
2021-06-04,pCbZhz5GRmg,you can probably find a pre reg e208 in a dealership for 20k that would definitely be a better buy
2021-06-17,pCbZhz5GRmg,but the mg zs ev may not tick everyones boxes
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,my 100 congestion charge discount ceases in october for my hybrid suv at 15 per day i either have to replace it with an eye watering 40k new ev suv if i still want to drive inside the new bigger zone where i live or buy a 2nd car such as this for half the price these figures make the 500 very attractive to londoners
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,wouldnt take a fiat if it was handed to me for free üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,base model looks great and i am sure the range would be enough for a lot of people a lot of the time its still expensive compared to ice alternatives but new tech often is and this is definitely a good value route into ev ownership great review thanks
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,the decider is second car or not if it is a to be a second car then its got to be less expensive to match the crop of shorter range vehicles available nearly newsecond hand the longer range model puts it back in the same league as other one car options
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,for about the same price you can get a better range bigger storage similarly or better equipped mg seat no competition in my view but im not bothered about style and funky
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,the cheapest mg is more than 20 more expensive we do love the seat mii electric though
2021-06-07,pCbZhz5GRmg,electrifyingcom list prices are irrelevant its lease costs that matter you can get a mii leaf zoe mg zs or 5 for less than this version or a kona ioniq and id3 for no more than the 42kwh version
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,nikki is a great presenter love the fiat too
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,i own a petrol fiat 500 and i love it ill definitely replace it with a new electric one but i have to admit to not really liking how theyve redesigned the back that said i was really struck at home much better the whole car looks in white i really wasnt sold on the three glum colours of the rest of the range a white one with all of the bigger battery and all the bells and whistles with the addition of some cool vinyls would be my perfect new car
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,if you want a fiat 500 take the old version in hybrid format and save over 6k and get more kit price of electric cars dont make sense right now and the old version is still selling well
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,apart from the fact that if you did 12000 miles a year then the hybrid one would likely cost you at least 1200 in fuel more likely 1500 whereas with cheap rate home charging it could cost around 150 so over the course of 5 years it pays for itself especially when you add in lower servicing costs as well
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,topo gigio tv cartoon character from the 1960s
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,i think theyve missed a trick here there are plenty of grumpy old gits like myself who would like the strippedout interior but still have a big battery all the new satnav stereo stuff will go out of date or even obsolete very quickly and i would rather be able to just install third party hardware that can be easily changed
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,unfortunately youre in the minority there dacia did this with the previous generation sandero but havent gone down the same route with the new one so it obviously didnt do too well
2021-06-04,pCbZhz5GRmg,johnknight9150 exactly its a dacia the whole point of dacia was that theyre no frills cars but clearly a lack of stereo is taking things too far
2021-06-04,pCbZhz5GRmg,q3b26 aye but if youre simply after a no frills car thats different plenty of us want a gorgeous car which is not a dacia but without the annoying electronics and gadgetry that plagues modern motoring i still drive a 1999 saab because its a nice balance of looks and comfort and fitted with a newer stereo provides enough modern convenience without getting in the way with annoying beeps and bongs and warning messages its sublime a lot of gadgetry in cars never gets used and a lot of customers would be happy not to pay for annoying distractions
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,the baterry is way to small a two digit range pretty much wouldnt work for me at all
2021-06-19,pCbZhz5GRmg,then buy one with a bigger batterynote the spelling of battery
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,interesting review that poses some important questions car looks fine and ideal for city living and commutes as ns clearly pointed out which car and options you go for depends upon your own needs
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,so this base 500e has a 24kwh battery
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,i love the look but the small range means its going to have stiff competition from the chinese once their tiny evs arrive costing from a few thousand pounds with a similar range i wonder what the pcl is on these
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,much like the mazda mx30 this seems like a very good if quite expensive second car
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,not very keen on this car
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,its a seriously sad state of affairs when 205k is considered a cheapno frills car these days the fact most people lease cars these days seems to give manufacturers license to inflate prices to eye watering levels
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,i notice it had an engine start button what engine it has a motor
2021-08-30,pCbZhz5GRmg,7755ian1 it does but only when setting off for the first time after turning on the car then the regular pedestrian alert hum is played which is very similar to most other evs out there
2021-11-23,pCbZhz5GRmg,did you get wallcharger i will get 7 kw thought its better
2022-05-21,pCbZhz5GRmg,did you the winter pack thinking of ordering one but i am not entirely convinced about the leather seats in winter without any heated seats
2022-05-21,pCbZhz5GRmg,thepeadar79 no we dont have heated seats they can get a bit chilly in the winter and theyre not actual leather but vinyl although very nice
2022-05-21,pCbZhz5GRmg,cochitravels thank you so much for your kind reply if i may ask is there anything that in hindsight you may have changed to your order or you are happy enough with the standard la prima unfortunately here at the moment theres only the icon trim on showroom so we may have to pay the deposit now without actually seeing the car
2022-05-21,pCbZhz5GRmg,thepeadar79 no worries if anything la prima requires a bit more upkeep because of the white interior and white steering wheel getting dirty after some use definitely must have accessories are the dimming rear view mirror panoramic sunroof and radar cruise control with lane keep assist
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,maybe i am just not trendy buy there is no way i would buy this over the mg zs not that i will ever have that conundrum as there is no way i will ever be able to afford an ev
2021-06-09,pCbZhz5GRmg,second hand evs are very reasonable now and given the lack of enginetransmissiondrivetrain actually as reliable as a new one it is going to be a thing we have to get used to a 23 year old ev is nearly the same as brand new apart from the price
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,absolutely horrendous its lost the charm old the old school style that fiat brought us with the new 500 and at this price they are dreaming add on all the options that come as standard on other brands like nissan etc then the fiat 500 really has lost its plot
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,20000 for a entry level city car üò± yes youll get your money back in running costs eventually but how long is that going to take when you can choose from many used equivalent city cars like vw ups starting from 5000 even all electric ones from 10000
2021-06-03,pCbZhz5GRmg,give it time and they will decrease in cost its exactly like iphones when they launched in 2007 they started off expensive and then moved to being slightly affordable
2021-06-07,pCbZhz5GRmg,in italy with governament reduction the action costs a total of 15k euros and the big battery version is around 20k euros
2021-06-09,pCbZhz5GRmg,scruffyita the uk government grant on electric cars is down to just 2500 used to be around 5000 and that only applies to electric cars under 35000 ive noticed other countries offering better incentives
2021-06-17,pCbZhz5GRmg,it could be sooner than you might think if charges to enter city centres like the one introduced in birmingham on the 1st june become more prevalent birmingham charges 8 per day 7 days per week for cars and vans not meeting euro 6 emissions york coventry leeds and bath are allegedly looking to do the same the day of the ev draws ever nearer
2021-06-25,pCbZhz5GRmg,danielrichards8472 yes very true i am in awe of the romanian govt being willing to offer their citizens a new electric car for only 7500 üòÆ
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,any ev with a range less than 150 miles real world is just full stop especially as used car buy after a few years just look at autotrader adds for used zoe or leaf and you will see range is a joke 5060 miles
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,why how many cars of this size only do 30 odd miles a day hell i dont think ive done over 150 miles in a day in a year
2021-06-04,pCbZhz5GRmg,benholroyd5221 well many or most people do less than a 30 miles a day worldwide however once a week or a month you decide to go to the nearest town or park and you are done not possible 100 miles ranges are joke these better be left for an electric scooter plus small city cars are used often for delivery food medicines car parts parcels well these evs wont make it plus the inconvenience of charging every day
2021-06-04,pCbZhz5GRmg,toninocars if youre rural enough to have to travel 50 miles to the nearest park youre probably rural enough to not need to travel to the park and what percentage of the global population are more than 50 miles from a town 1 01 it doesnt need to work for 100 of the population 100 of the time people have second cars some people dont travel 50 miles to a park
2021-06-04,pCbZhz5GRmg,benholroyd5221 well the time will show what i mean all these zoe and leafs are wasted if they were ice cars would have been sold again and in use the electric cars with short ranges will create a future problem shortage of used cars and will drive ice used cars sky high prices until there is no more petrol available in the garages
2021-06-04,pCbZhz5GRmg,toninocars id disagree ev sales are still a small percentage of overall sales and were already moving out of the realm of sub 100 mile evs as such the numbers of low range evs hanging around are going to be low and demand is going to be buoyed by second hand buyers wanting any ev at the very least i think you overestimate most peoples desire for ic over new you can get 15 year old cars for relative peanuts people still want the latest and greatest i dont think the person who buys a new car every 3 years is going to stop because ev
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,a refreshingly honest review thank you and yes having a pairedback car can often be fun more then for the driver to do so more interaction with the process of driving fab car
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,i have always liked the 500 i was lucky enough to own an early proper 500 1968 model with the 499cc 2 cylinder petrol engine it still has an appealing look even now though i dont think much of the headlight design the lower range battery would be no good for me as i do a 74 mile round trip daily commute which is mostly motorway miles in this area the infrastructure just isnt good enough having done some research at present its still cheaper to run my 2011 smart diesel as i am unable to have a home chargepoint i would have to have another vehicle to complete my working weeks journeys as i would only be able to charge up on my days off due to the only chargepoints being in a car park which closes at night i work long unsociable hours and wouldnt be able to get to the car park during opening hours very often at present i am going to have to stick with my little smart diesel until battery range on vehicles improves and prices become more affordable admittedly battery ranges are improving in so many reviews its assumed that drivers want range for doing longer journeys in many cases this is true but its also needed for those of us who are unable to have a home chargepoint and where the infrastructure is also very poor just as a side point i have written to my local councils and mp on many occasions but have never received a response thank you for your reviews i enjoy watching this channel and have subscribed although not many of the cars appeal to me personally i am intrigued by the advances in battery technology having also briefly owned a reva g wiz many years ago
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,the front headlight design looks similar to that phase the vw beetle owners went through by sticking eyelashes on its headlights each one to their own i guess
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,this is the one that makes more sense how many people need to top up after 70 miles around town which is where 95 of them will live looks better without silly big wheels as well
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,basically acceptable ev credibility from 20122017
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,fiat is the best
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,fine as a second car but the larger battery version could be an only car for someone without a family i think the current crop of smaller evs are going to be interesting used buys in a few years when they wont be eye wateringly expensive the eight year battery warranties take away a lot of the risk of a three year old car too
2021-06-04,pCbZhz5GRmg,the battery is large
2022-03-10,pCbZhz5GRmg,when i purchased a used 500e the price was fine but now that gas prices are in the 6 range the prices of high mileage 500es have skyrocketed so converting a gas version with a manual transmission is the way to go at this point in time
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,fiat 500e however
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,lets hope stellantis can live up to the legacy of this car so far theyve shown to produce cheap quality and act arrogantly towards customers and critical journalists
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,i realize the fiat is in very hot water here right now in the states as far as the possibility of it being axed but i do hope they bring this 500 to the states it would be good competition for the mini se
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,axed what ever for
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,menifo4334 last i heard i thought they were going to pull fiat out of the us though i must stress i havent had the opportunity to hear anything super recent so if they changed their mind and decided to keep fiat in the states then im all the happier
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,maybe you could ask frank stephenson what he thinks of how his design has been updated this is the perfect city car except one major flaw no male could possibly be seen dead in this shame cos i like it
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,i drive a smart electric and have preserved my masculinity just get the 500e in black and green with dark interior
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,smartelectriccar hahahahahhahaahahaha deep breath hahahahahaahahahahahahaha
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,that kind of opinion shows toxic masculinity i would buy its available in my country i wouldnt even mind a pink one if its add to the rare factor
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,look at fiats sales figures and then look at a road disregarding the abarth models no males buy 500s period so dont lie that youd buy one let alone in pink cos you wouldnt
2021-06-02,pCbZhz5GRmg,ill be picking up a 500e in a few weeks time ill let you know if my masculinity shrivels up and dies
2022-04-11,3W2qN7F7F1A,are there any fully electric not hybrid small vans out there
2022-03-23,3W2qN7F7F1A,i worried about the footwell space but if you just slightly pull your left leg back you find the resting place perfectly lines your knee and calf up with a little concave curve in the dash so it just kind of hugs your kneeits very comforting weve just paid our deposit for one and cant wait to go fully electric
2023-06-23,3W2qN7F7F1A,paulhayes2189 i love it absolutely love it with aircon infotainment and lights i think the range is more like 150 miles but i can go a whole week to and from work on one charge charging at motorway services can be painfully slow but if youre passing a gridserve electric highway like the one a braintree essex its soooo fast i went from 49 to 85 in 15 minutes the footwell size is no issue at all even if im wearing big winter boots theres plenty of room climate control is a blessing in winter and very efficient at defrosting you can pack a huge amount in it with or without dropping the back seats the turning circle it small and being a small car you can park in some pretty small spaces in short i have no regrets getting my 500e none at all üòä
2022-01-01,3W2qN7F7F1A,looks great really hope they fix the foot placement thought particularly for frequent long commuters i imagine doing 2 x 15hour trips every work day that would get annoying quickly aside from that it sounds awesome keep the mini evs videos coming really enjoy them mini car not mini video length although that works too xd
2022-02-13,3W2qN7F7F1A,you learn to comfortably place your leg around it then its really no biggie even after a 6090 minutes behind the wheel 1 pedal driving helps give you some more room
2021-12-16,3W2qN7F7F1A,decent fiat that
2021-12-08,3W2qN7F7F1A,i am also a total petrolhead and had never previously driven a bev until i had an extended test drive of a 500e last week one pedal range mode which made a huge impression for the same reasons as you i immediately placed an order and it should arrive later this month i hope the next owner of my tradein a twingo gt enjoys it as much as i did but for me ice vehicles are now as redundant as steam powered cars at the beginning of last century
2021-10-26,3W2qN7F7F1A,plonkerheads usless expensive toy car review done
2021-10-10,3W2qN7F7F1A,why use inches this is a european car they still use metric because its logical and sensible
2021-12-16,3W2qN7F7F1A,uk is the special child in europe
2021-09-17,3W2qN7F7F1A,what model is this looking at getting one i seen its a one medal drive is that right x
2021-08-08,3W2qN7F7F1A,a nice car but the range is off putting real world driving around 90 miles isnt it like buying a similar sized car with a fuel tank of less then 2 gallons my town car a 900cc twin air fiat 500 will do around 450 miles or only 20 miles short of london to scotland thats with the heater on im all in favour for an ev but range and price is paramount at over 20k i think there are cheaper cars out there with a longer range like the the seat mii with a 37 kwh battery just like the first mobile phones vhs video players and 50 inch tvs not many people could afford them in time another 10 years im sure this same car will be priced around 14k in todays money
2021-06-19,3W2qN7F7F1A,i want the newww 500e but i live in for saken america üò©üò©üò©üò© i hate it hereüò£üò£
2021-06-12,3W2qN7F7F1A,i want to buy electric i believe in the ethics etc but why oh why so expensive who has this kind of money i dont best i can afford for a second hand car is 4k
2021-06-11,3W2qN7F7F1A,seat mii electric 16k if you shop around not as stylish as this but still a brilliant city car
2021-06-11,3W2qN7F7F1A,any tiny city car at 20k is 100 not a bargain im sorry
2021-06-08,3W2qN7F7F1A,nice car but 32k
2021-06-07,3W2qN7F7F1A,you spent remarkably little time stuck in a queue given that you were driving round the middle of cambridge it was fun spotting the locations from glimpses out of the window this was also pretty much the definition of an unnecessary car journey which is exactly the sort of thing we want less of round here marginally better in an ev than an ice car i suppose
2021-06-07,3W2qN7F7F1A,great vid and also has wireless apple carplay but no room for any passengers in the back unless they have left their legs at home i think you may be the first review to mention the left foot problem
2021-06-04,3W2qN7F7F1A,that awkwardness with the left foot position would be a dealbreaker for mei know i wouldnt be able to stop being annoyed by it
2021-06-05,3W2qN7F7F1A,doesnt occur in the lhd version surprised they didnt think more about that in design conversion i drive a gen 1 fiat 500e in california have had no problem with left foot placement
2021-06-04,3W2qN7F7F1A,my 2014 fiat 500e is now 7 years old over 70000 miles best car ive ever owned i dont see any battery degradation so far the car has paid for itself in fuel cost savings maintenance costs are still zero except for tires and head light bulbs
2021-06-04,3W2qN7F7F1A,had a 500e in the family for 7 months now and we are in love
2021-06-03,3W2qN7F7F1A,my daughter drove the kona for the first time she had some problems with smooth braking then i found out she uses the left foot for braking so should you
2021-06-03,3W2qN7F7F1A,disliked for animal skin seats
2021-06-03,3W2qN7F7F1A,not sure how you think this beats the mini for value for money if you spec them the same they cost the same plus the fiat has a significant power disadvantage
2021-06-02,3W2qN7F7F1A,hey kol same setup here as well mercedes twin turbo v8 and 500e laprima in dark blue cabrioperfect combo remember this phrase said to me by a porsche salesman when talking about the difference between petrol and electric driving one petrol or electric really makes you appreciate the other
2021-06-02,3W2qN7F7F1A,ordered mine the 15th of march got a phone call a week later from the dealer that specs had all changed and needed to reorder so lots of heat scratching trying to get exactly what i wanted against what was allowed as fiat ordering had not updated web site to match new ordering site basically it appears fiat were coping with over demand by cutting range a bit dealer and i finally reached a good compromise and fiat swallowed the small price increase as a bit if good faith got a call today that car will be ready for collection june 4th so roughly 10 weeks delivery time on an in demand car got the rag top so looking forward to a super summer cant waitüòÅ
2021-06-02,3W2qN7F7F1A,yeah weve had a similar experience with their dealerships but its great news that youre getting it in time for this awesome weather well done
2021-05-31,3W2qN7F7F1A,for lots of people 20000 for a limited range run around is off putting specially when you look at the very limited running gear they have to produce for an e car compared to combustion engined vehicles they just are not good value
2021-05-30,3W2qN7F7F1A,fiat 500 httpsyoutubezoc1qwllfki
2021-05-30,3W2qN7F7F1A,brilliant a fab new ev choice aggressively priced yet fully kitted and a properly usable range very impressed
2021-05-30,3W2qN7F7F1A,the 500 doesnt have twice the range of the honda e nevertheless the honda e has eightfold the driving fun and ride quality quadruple the wow factor and originality twice the confort and practicality and presumably a zillion times more reliability the car and the battery
2021-05-30,3W2qN7F7F1A,just for completeness the leftfootissue is only a problem on the righthand drive model but then again you can always drive it racing style with your left foot on the brake
2021-05-30,3W2qN7F7F1A,wouldnt ever buy a fiat utter garbage no matter how you dress it up european cars will be the last on my list of cars to buy tesla or japanese cars are def better choices
2021-05-30,3W2qN7F7F1A,this and the renault zoe are the best small electric cars
2021-12-13,3W2qN7F7F1A,everypc how things change in 6 months
2021-05-30,3W2qN7F7F1A,hang on you got that fiat 500 money mamas broke this is a take on that mcdonalds money you tube vids you see everywhere
2021-05-29,3W2qN7F7F1A,well whatever bites your biscuit
2021-05-29,3W2qN7F7F1A,hei if you talk about the new 500 you cant not mention the fca my dream garage option you get only if buy a 500 httpswwwfiatcomelectriccarmydreamgarageapp
2021-05-29,3W2qN7F7F1A,fiat 500e is small and feels small too plastic interior and has a much more cheaper feel than honda e overall i prefer honda e even if it has less range i bought honda e instead after driving fiat 500e here in sweden honda e gives you much better build quality more interesting tech more comfort cooler retrofuturistic design interior that gives you a feel of a nice looking living room lots of huge screens hdmiin and much more to enjoy range is good enough for its purpose too honda e makes other people smile when you drives around in town its fun and makes everyone happy really great car compared to fiat 500e
2021-05-29,3W2qN7F7F1A,youve definitely made some valid points but for me i buy a car to travel in and therefore range takes priority over design and hdmi sockets the 500 is super comfy has enough range to not have range anxiety and is nimble to use in the city i also love the new stance design of the 500
2021-05-30,3W2qN7F7F1A,agree i rented one of these and found it to be the most uncomfortable vehicle i have ever been in add to that the cheap feel of the interior and i would run away from this car as fast as possible toyota and honda quality is far ahead
2021-05-29,3W2qN7F7F1A,why are you promoting animal skin on the seats
2021-06-01,3W2qN7F7F1A,lassievision üòÇüòÇ brilliant üòÇüòÇ
2021-05-29,3W2qN7F7F1A,not to be like that i think the 500e looks like an awesome city car but you kind of forgot the zoe its best in class for range affordability
2021-05-29,3W2qN7F7F1A,great video chaps what a lovely little car im a big fan of it i just hope fiat make an electric panda
2021-05-29,3W2qN7F7F1A,we have nicer weather in australia but no affordable evs bring em in
2021-05-30,3W2qN7F7F1A,we have a similar ev problem in the us no fiat 500e no renault zoe no vw id3 most of the bestselling evs in europe are not for sale in the us
2021-06-04,3W2qN7F7F1A,to be fair i dont find 20k affordable the new dacia spring will be more affordable than this and offers more space inside and in the boot you can barely get in the back seats of a 500
2021-08-08,3W2qN7F7F1A,dirkdiggler6230 looks and not reliability if im spending that kind of money id be more interested in reliability and as a sidenote i currently drive a fiat i have previously owned about 5 other fiats throughout my life so ive nothing against fiat my point was simply that evs in general are still way too expensive in europe many of us would love to go green but unfortunately cant afford to
2021-05-29,3W2qN7F7F1A,fiat is one of the least reliable auto makers but happy to see they are transitioning to electric
2021-05-29,3W2qN7F7F1A,pisses me off that they wont be bringing this to the us damn shame hey fiat bring it over
2021-05-29,3W2qN7F7F1A,great big honking v8 fiat 500e maybe something in the middle of that field just a thought
2021-05-28,3W2qN7F7F1A,and finally a fiat that could be reliable
2021-05-31,3W2qN7F7F1A,had 2 fiats panda 120000 trouble free miles punto 89000 trouble free miles my experience of them does not match the hype ps had much more trouble with a ford cortina specially front suspension legs
2021-06-01,3W2qN7F7F1A,had my twinair 500 for 6yrs now without any problems and is as much fun to drive as my pug 205 19 gti was in the 90s 850 cc turbo cute and the little bugger can still do 110mph and unlike the mini bmw its got character and a massive personality i love my fierce 500 oh and im a bloke tattoos gold teeth piercings and everything üòÇüòÇüòÇ
2021-06-01,3W2qN7F7F1A,i had a 13 fiat 500 abarth most fun ive ever had in a car with my clothes onextremely reliable car until i lost a coil on the highway and continued to drive i destroyed the lower end of the engine fing idiot i took it to the shop the 1st time it briefly dropped its rpms on the highway and they only found vacuum leaks to fix i completely blame myself as i knew the coils were notoriously weak temp gauge never moved had a set of alfa 4c coils on order when i scrambled her i am still sick about walking away from that car today i got her from a good friend for 10 k w 20 k on the odometer she died at 90 k 3 years after purchase cant imagine how great the electric version is drove this car from phoenix az to las vegas at night never been in a car that could launch up a hill so fast ive heard it referred to as a canyon runner yes it is this 14 l turbo 172 hp motor is the same as the jeep compass and the dodge dart i would buy another one tomorrow if offered to me mine was white with the top half painted black aftermarket very sharp car
2021-06-01,3W2qN7F7F1A,richgarlick9194 isnt it just great when something as simple as a little car can have such an effect on you and just gives you so many good memories great story man
2021-06-23,3W2qN7F7F1A,8 years of abarth ownership solid car nothing major still love it like day one
2021-05-30,3W2qN7F7F1A,a californian compliance electric 500 perhaps
2021-05-28,3W2qN7F7F1A,this was a great wee first drive video loved the banter and fun fiat doing wat they do best great little city cars this is going to be a pretty big deal i think for alot of younger people looking to get in to the ev world the variety in specs range and price etc will be massive selling points for so many looks like its managed to maintain its 500ness and yet move with the times huge advances in the interior from the older models well done fiat
2021-05-28,3W2qN7F7F1A,whatever bites your biscuit thats not an expression it is now
2021-06-01,3W2qN7F7F1A,i thought he said buttersthe cc on the video agreed w you steven
2021-05-28,3W2qN7F7F1A,lovely car good range reasonable charging speed however the boot is on the tiny side to be expected in such a small car but if the car is to be the only driver it would need to fit a bit of luggage for short journeys
2021-06-23,3W2qN7F7F1A,i hardly use the boot i toss everything in the backseat of my abarth 500595
2021-05-28,3W2qN7F7F1A,the achilles heel of the previous 500e was the total lack of a dc fast charger _and_ a small range a gutpunch combination this one is everything that one should have been but unfortunately it will not be available where im at usa
2021-05-29,3W2qN7F7F1A,cant you order one through a chrysler or dodge dealer
2021-05-29,3W2qN7F7F1A,nor australia unfortunately though its a perfect city car and most people only do 5080km a day commutes
2021-05-29,3W2qN7F7F1A,antonthompson7838 not to my knowledge best i could do is possibly buy one from a canadian dealer if they sell it there or from a dealer in europe and have it shipped both of which would massively add to the cost
2021-06-02,3W2qN7F7F1A,justwasted3hourshere i thought you couldnt import a foreign car to america until it was 25 years old
2021-05-28,3W2qN7F7F1A,great looking car
2021-05-28,3W2qN7F7F1A,almost every fiat over the last 6 years has just been a reshaping the fiat 500 to me it looks a feminine design wish they would release a replacement fiat bravo ev
2021-05-28,3W2qN7F7F1A,not bad on the range for the but ill wait for the xpeng p7 no more egolf for me why make a car like that with 100 mile range at least fiat this time stepped it up with some range
2021-05-29,3W2qN7F7F1A,the egolf is a compliance car not a bad one but it still is
2021-05-28,3W2qN7F7F1A,hmmm italian design and styling without the idiosyncratic mechanical temperament but the cost üòñ
2021-05-28,3W2qN7F7F1A,i want a gas one used for about 10k30k is out of my budget love this car
2021-05-28,3W2qN7F7F1A,you can find used electric ones for under 8000 all day long though with a 100 mile range
2021-05-28,3W2qN7F7F1A,will they do an abarth version for blokes i dont think im strong minded enough to drive a 500 and all the abuse i would get off workmates and friends unfortunately the 500 is the go to girl car
2021-05-28,3W2qN7F7F1A,anonimushbosh dont need a manly car at all ive drove nothing but fairy normal hatchbacks all my life just the standard 500s are the quintessential girly girl car i have nothing against small cars ether i would love a honda e if i had the monies
2021-05-28,3W2qN7F7F1A,well done clever video as long as you just need a commuter theyre fine but if you do distance forget about it then you need two cars
2021-05-28,3W2qN7F7F1A,you could if you really wanted to fiat also addressed another shortcoming previously slow to charge the time for the 2020 500e is greatly reduced using an 85kilowatt charger the battery can reach 80 percent in a mere 35 minutes
2021-05-29,3W2qN7F7F1A,george090974 exactly this range argument is becoming moot very rapidly
2021-06-01,3W2qN7F7F1A,how many times a month you need to do more than 250km without stopping
2021-05-28,3W2qN7F7F1A,nice video lads kol you could spend an hour learning to brake with your left foot go kart style youll never look back wait do use your mirrors though
2021-05-28,3W2qN7F7F1A,cant wait to order one genuinely fun little car with a whopping 199 miles of range üòç
2021-06-01,3W2qN7F7F1A,199 is the wltp range which is good for comparing vehicles but isnt what youll get in real life count on 120 to 160 miles in mixed use driving depending on outside temperature and speed
2023-06-22,3W2qN7F7F1A,so driving normally under 55 milescqm hour you are really looking at approx 150 miles no more
2021-05-28,3W2qN7F7F1A,asked fiat to contact me for a test drive they didnt i got a seat mii instead not as sexy as the 500e but itll do
2024-05-06,KT3wzgHOuPw,what a great car for 22000 us dollars wait what its 35000 that a lot of bucks for an electric skate board
2024-04-28,KT3wzgHOuPw,amore i own a 2017 500e as my fulltime ride luckily it fits my commuter patterns as well ive owned numerous convertibles so will look at the 500e cabrio version in future zippy easy to park great accessories top quality so fun to drive
2024-04-27,KT3wzgHOuPw,soon we start our 50000km european tour in a 53 year old fiat 500r check it out
2024-03-22,KT3wzgHOuPw,as previous owner of a fiat 500 never buying a fiat they are made like junk and the most random stuff keep breaking pure garbage
2024-03-21,KT3wzgHOuPw,i bought one of the first ones a 2015 model i am still driving it 60k on the odometer i live in a city its range went from 95 down to about 6070now i drive an hour up to the wine country charge then drive back its fine i have another vehicle for road trips and i drive my old fiat 90 of the time i would definitely buy another one its the funnest fastest sportiest car ive ever driven i do know that other buyers have had troubles with their car i have never had any trouble i have replaced only the tires it goes through tires but i live on the famous super steep sf hills but after 60k miles my brakes still work fine i am just saying i love this car i would hope to buy a larger suv type electric in another couple years the key to preserving your car is simple always keep the battery between 2080 dont charge to full never run down to 0 of course i charge it to full before a long trip up to the country and a handful of times ive forced it to 0 or even a couple miles past zero emergency happen in 9 years of driving really never do that just saying if you need a computer car that you can park literally anywhere because it is so small this is a real winner i like have all that extra room in my garage
2024-03-18,KT3wzgHOuPw,isnt the range 199 miles i have one and love if
2024-03-14,KT3wzgHOuPw,the red fiat looks like a broken lipstick tipso cute i usually dont like red but this red is gorgeous i hope it comes as a gas car i am not into electric cars at all our electric grid is not enough for everyone to have ev cars
2024-03-13,KT3wzgHOuPw,ive always loved the little 500 üòä ice or ev
2024-03-06,KT3wzgHOuPw,i cant believe this turd is allowed in the us just goes to show you what joe biden thinks of his subjects marie antoinette said let them eat cake biden says let them buy crap and die on the highway
2024-03-04,KT3wzgHOuPw,price is the biggest issue although in the uk a 10 discount is freely available
2024-03-03,KT3wzgHOuPw,hope chinese evs shows up one day you can get mid size suv starting 10000 brand new
2024-02-24,KT3wzgHOuPw,this car should start from 25k
2024-02-16,KT3wzgHOuPw,just bring the abarth back to the us this cars specs dont work for the american market people typically have 1 car that needs to do short city runs and longer highway drives this 35k ev can only reliably do shorter drives it is completely ineffective in colder markets
2024-01-22,KT3wzgHOuPw,ive been looking forward to this for years but i was expecting juuust a little bit more power 8 seconds to 100 kmh is so slow i consider it dangerous i was sure this thing would have done 6 seconds sad pass
2024-01-12,KT3wzgHOuPw,still kind of pricey and poor acceleration times for an ev bring us an updated abarth e to the usa for around 28k then i would be tempted
2024-01-06,KT3wzgHOuPw,numerous true arguments and for me in austria the new fiat 500e has too little ground clearance it is too heavy looks too fat and is far too expensive at half the price the leapmotor t03 baojun yep or chery eq1 are more suitable for me and i will test them
2023-12-31,KT3wzgHOuPw,its not going to sell 34k is too much for an ev especially when you have ice vehicle that is cheaper people looking at this vehicle will end up buying an accord or civic
2023-12-31,KT3wzgHOuPw,yeah but 35k still going for a tesla this is a 12k car
2023-12-31,KT3wzgHOuPw,red thats a republican color no republicans will be buying this overpriced appliance you should have made it blue and for 16000
2024-01-15,KT3wzgHOuPw,red and blue are both nice colors on the 500 please drop the political slant if auto manufacturers make a good mileage and quality vehicle the company can sell at an affordable price for consumers the dealers dont try and over price it people will but it let the numbers of sales make the money for everyone
2023-12-29,KT3wzgHOuPw,this will fail eventually looks great tho shame about their business model
2023-12-28,KT3wzgHOuPw,we need more little cars like this around la
2024-03-14,KT3wzgHOuPw,we need more little cars periodi drive mostly by myself not lugging anything
2023-12-23,KT3wzgHOuPw,whyyyyy wont they make new abarths or bring the electric abarth to the us
2023-12-26,KT3wzgHOuPw,its so cute i just want a small ev
2024-02-07,KT3wzgHOuPw,because tesla is efficient i wish tesla would make a car in this similar size
2024-02-23,KT3wzgHOuPw,then buy one ill take the fiat
2024-03-29,KT3wzgHOuPw,no for 35k u get a fiat thats the point of buying a 500 üòÇ
2024-04-08,KT3wzgHOuPw,the tesla insurance is so high because of total frame destruction upon damage the fiat is much more repairable and hence cheaper insurance lets look at the total experience of ownership
2024-05-08,KT3wzgHOuPw,updan not to mention the repair cost of owning a fiat also the fiat has no battery warranty
2023-12-20,KT3wzgHOuPw,first thing id do is paint the grill gloss black so it brought out its iconic smile üòä
2023-12-14,KT3wzgHOuPw,first gen fiat 500 was great but less dealers supporting fiat theyll test for battery condition for 600 to try to get replaced under warranty if they can say it doesnt qualify youre out 600
2023-12-20,KT3wzgHOuPw,i dont think its legal to charge you for warranty costs its up to the customer to realize youll lose 10miish from a 10yo ev
2023-12-10,KT3wzgHOuPw,the target market for the size is people who dont have room to park anything bigger but then the target market for the battery is people who can reliably plug in every day or two that sounds like a very small ven diagram of people in north america
2023-12-15,KT3wzgHOuPw,or people who dont feel the need to buy the biggest vehicle that fits in their garage
2023-12-09,KT3wzgHOuPw,we get this expensive overpriced car but we wont get the new ev renault twingo thats like 20k and arguably cooler
2023-12-09,KT3wzgHOuPw,nice car happy to see another fiat model in america still have my 2012 500 abarthand its never for salewill get the electric abarth when it arrives
2023-12-09,KT3wzgHOuPw,eventually when the repair cost is more than a low mileage used one üòÖ
2023-12-11,KT3wzgHOuPw,fortheloveofnoise9298i have a 2013 fiat 500 abarth as well an with almost 200000miles its not going anywhere as well its been across the us and i have had it since it was brand new maintaining it has never broke the bank and there hasnt been any mechanical issuesfailures
2024-01-17,KT3wzgHOuPw,mateorosas1272 im happy you asked if you have a 500 tubro500t abarth or a 500 after 2019 with the tubro as the only engine you must change the spark plugs at 30k intervals if not it will make the ignition coils fail eventually and cause a miss fire have the engine coolant and brake fluid flush i also recommend having your serpentine belt checked and it might need to be replaced just recently i have found out the aosair oil separator should be cleaned and gasket replaced along with the pcv valve at 40k one might not have any problems if pushed but if not taken care of can make one think they have a bad engine with light white smoke at a stop or idle it literally a 35 fixmaintenance in parts to make sure you 500 keeps running great along with your oil changes battery replacements and engine air filter changes this should help get you to 200k i happy to answer any other questions
2023-12-05,KT3wzgHOuPw,on board charger 115kw
2023-12-05,KT3wzgHOuPw,fiat says 11 so its probably 115 haha
2023-12-05,KT3wzgHOuPw,if fiat doesnt offer this in a cheaper option lets say equivalent or cheaper than the soon to be discontinued chevrolet bolt then theyre really doing themselves a disservice this thing could potentially sell amazingly well if it was cheaper since they are pricing it higher it could end up being discontinued rather fast just like the mazda mx30
2023-12-23,KT3wzgHOuPw,to be fair they dont seem to care this time the fiat ceo basically said they just wanna sell special versions
2024-01-07,KT3wzgHOuPw,its being imported from italy currently so they would probably have to manufacture 500es in north america to get the price that low
2024-02-11,KT3wzgHOuPw,the bolt is coming back in 2025 with even better range and faster charging im looking for a subcompact ev but 35k is insane
2023-12-05,KT3wzgHOuPw,i would love to have 2 motor all wheel drive
2023-12-05,KT3wzgHOuPw,sounds fun but then were adding back in so much weight because youd probably need a larger battery pack too
2023-12-20,KT3wzgHOuPw,its sad they didnt do it to the abarth version but theres also zero room under the car back there it has to use a torsion beam because of it but im sure people would be ok with losing the back trunk and seats
2023-09-16,CYsKSywBIys,fiat mini ev four seater with power windows ac will dominate in market
2023-06-29,CYsKSywBIys,unfortunately here in the us fiat doesnt have a good reputation
2023-04-08,CYsKSywBIys,yes it is the cheapest electric car and at the same time the poorest elcar in every aspectüòâ
2023-01-30,CYsKSywBIys,hmm a bit more expensive than i thought for the larger battery version certainly heading for the e corsae 208 price bracket
2023-01-18,CYsKSywBIys,anything less than a le prima and you have to pay for extra even for a fully adjustable drivers seat not heated its clear that fiat has pushed comfort standards asideeven tho they are charging 325k i really didnt like the la prima interior so i went for the icon 87kw with some extra packs my old fiat 500ss came with a fully adjustable seats and floor mats my abarth also had them as standard oh you also have to pay extra for floor mats instead fiat have wasted money just overloaded the car with tech most of which ive already turned off and find annoying as hell coming from my old abarth 595 competitione to a fiat 500e icon has definitely been eye opening and not in the best way the range is actually more like 145miles at least thats what ive found over the month ive had it driving mostly in range mode dont know how the hell she got 199 miles üòÇnot a chance
2023-04-27,CYsKSywBIys,ive just ordered a 500e red edition
2022-12-15,CYsKSywBIys,i have owned the q4 for coming up to 12 months now i agree with everything that has been said but audi do need to desperately update the software on the early cars there are a few glitches and a screen that comes on every time you start the car which you have to physically press ok to clear it regarding driving modes and range i have found it to be slightly better driving it in d mode than b mode especially now its getting colder for some reason audi do say its more efficient in d mode than b
2022-12-15,CYsKSywBIys,i have a 2014 fiat 500e now and i love it i definitely hope they ship the fiat la prima to the usa that car is my jam
2024-05-24,CYsKSywBIys,flash forward 1 year and the 500e is now being sold in the usa
2022-12-12,CYsKSywBIys,apparently the 500e is coming to north america im on the fence if this will sell or not sales of the 500 when it came back to north america in 2011 peaked during the first couple of years then slowly fizzled out until it made no sense for fiat to continue supporting the brand in north america customers simply went nuts with suvs and pickup trucks to the point that other car manufacturers dropped their cheap car offerings altogether with ford only keeping the mustang as their only car type vehicle
2022-12-31,CYsKSywBIys,do you know when the new 500e is scheduled to come to north america
2022-12-12,CYsKSywBIys,i think its very interesting that fiat is pushing so hard for reviews of these cars over a year after they came to the uk poor rhd sales perhaps could you please do a quick video showing where to safely put your left foot when driving thatd be great thanks
2022-12-12,CYsKSywBIys,while i have no sales numbers for the entire continent the fiat 500e has been in the top 5 of german new electric vehicle registration statistics for at least the last few months
2022-12-12,CYsKSywBIys,the range and price isnt good enough a lot of people are going to be forced off the road if prices dont come down and range doesnt increase
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,great small car you havent got the dacia spring there its more cheap less attractive though
2022-12-12,CYsKSywBIys,unfortunately the spring isnt on sale in the uk where we are based
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,i have a 52 year old 1970 500l quite a short range for very different reasons ill stick with that one
2022-12-12,CYsKSywBIys,i too want an affordable car the problem is that affordable cars dont provide the profit that todays automakers need to survive toyota motors can no longer survive on the profits delivered by a tercel or echo chrysler couldnt survive on the profits from dodge omnis todays stellantis surely can not do so either there wont be a cheap fiat 500e providing pete with an affordable car is not a concern to the automakers their job is to make a profit and give that money to the shareholders the automakers dont care if pete or anyone else has to take the bus
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,whatever miles it says always reduce 100 miles out of it that will be the realistic range in any condition and also deduct futhuer 5 miles every year as your batteries are dying as well now you decide what car you want with that price
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,take 100 miles off it you say thats funny because my bmw i3 has a wltp range of 137 miles yet i regularly got 140150 miles in summer and im currently getting about 120 miles in winter strange that oh and its 5 years old thats strange too isnt it
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,if youre shopping in the preowned market want the 42kwh drivetrain and are not overbothered about tech the discontinued passion version was a good compromise at several thousand cheaper than the more upmarket versions
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,ive had the la primanot by bocelli for a year and covered 11000 miles car has been perfect and all the self driving tech is amazing i can get about 160180 miles in summer and 140160 in winter over fast moorland roads and the lower echelons of the two are when hooning it üòÇ its a cracking fun car to drive 062 8 seconds great chassis balance and its a 100kw motor not 87 as advertised thats only for low power mode üôÇ couldnt recommend it more to people and because its a fiat 500 no one expects it to take off the way it does theres few who will beat you at the lights and it even holds its on in the twisty stuff great machine and well worth your time and consideration
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,the 42kw version is the only ev in the world with a cabrio that has a 300km range pity that the price went up from 30k in 2020 to 37k in 2022 what is great is that it is a 2 door ev and that makes it more environmentally friendly less material less weight
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,could really do with the winter range as well as the manufacturers aspirational range
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,too be honest a 24kw version will probably suit me fine am finding my peugeot e208 range quite generous not that am complaining üòÅ
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,the higher spec 500 seems to make no sense to me i get that they are fashion statements but you can get a real usable car for that money mg4 springs to mind but there are others in the pipeline
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,the mg4 has no cabrio version and the mg4 is about 400kg more heavy than the fiat 500e cabrio 99 of the time there is nobody sitting in the 2 empty seats in the back and there is no use for the 2 rear doors so what is a real usable car we use only 2 seats 100 of the time and 70 of the time we enjoy the openend cabrio roof
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,chrispenn715 smaller cars appeal to a very large part of the globale market not everyone weighs 150kg and needs a 10 square meter car üòÅ countries like china and india mostly use small cars specially in crowded cities and even most europeans ride around in small leightweight ice cars except maybe the germans but they to are starting to grow bigger and bigger üòâ
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,yall often forget most of the world drives on the right so that 3rd door option is pretty slick
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,23k is enough for a small car just needs the bigger battery to make it a player once the small chinese evs hit in 2023
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,my wife loves the fun look of the fiat 500 but i seriously doubt she would be happy driving one me id get a kick out of running errands around town in the cabrio model im surprised by the 24kw models range as my leaf had the same size battery and could barely hit 100 miles in ideal conditions
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,100 miles is a fantasy its rated for 30 kwh100 miles here in america our ratings are closer to reality than the wltp ratings yall use accordingly the 24 kwh battery version would only have a range of 80 miles
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,i love the wireless android auto in my iconworks flawless each time no issues makes me laugh how alot of ev cars are still wired only android auto yet these same cars have a wireless charging padwhere is the sense in that even the new mg4 has dated wired android auto when my lease is up in 17 month i wont be getting another car that is wired only makes a world of difference which if you have not used it before you will not understand
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,charming as you are you lost me when you stated something like this is the cheapest car in the uk except for other 3 that are cheaper and also this is not available to buy now whats the point of it all madam nil points
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,for everyone who does not knowalways ignore the offical rangewhen you get the car you litterally see the 199 range show up1 time then after that in summer you can sometimes charge to 170 miles or about 160 miles winter it is more like 140 to 150 mile range
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,ev database states youll get around 145 real range im currently at the same mark with my 40kw gen 2 leaf im sure the leaf is also more efficient than the fiat
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,caolkyle actually i was getting a full 170 when it was warmer weather in the weather we have right now im getting about 145155i got 155 the other day i keep a check on it it is 160 miles a week to work and back and when it was warmer i did not have to charge during the week right now i am charging once but only about 50 mile top up
2022-12-12,CYsKSywBIys,marklola12 is that in a leaf or fiat
2022-12-15,CYsKSywBIys,rule of thumb with evs is always 90 real world summer 70 real world winter take off a further 10 for motorways add on 10 for town driving only
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,no point going for the 24kw version and go for the 42kw like i did tbh the icon model has everything you really need i got mine for 250 a month which includes maintience and it cost a extra 10 a month in that price for the black model as the free white colour was out of stock
2022-12-12,CYsKSywBIys,unless of course you dont do more than 75 miles a day
2023-01-05,CYsKSywBIys,dreador true but you have to factor in charging and how often you will need to charge and also factor in removing about 40 miles from the so called range the car has in winter
2023-01-09,CYsKSywBIys,marklola12 yeah i did thats why i said 75 miles not 115
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,i have had the icon version on lease sine april great car only issue i have had was aload of warning signs and sounds and it turned out the 12v battery was defected and had case damage and was leaking acid all sorted and enjoying it again i am 6ft 3 and have tons of room i have to have my drivers seat as far back as it can go but there is only me in the car so its a non issue loads of leg and head room the front of the car is pretty spacious and helps having the big space where the gear stick etc would normally be the only thing i have really is the rear view mirror blocks a bit of sight but the icon version does not have seat height adjustment so not sure if that would fix that as the position its in is perfect for everything else seeing the speedo screen etc the previous car was a petrol ds3 crossback lease which had way less room at the front not much leg room or headroom and also i had to have the seat set at its lowest setting and the steering wheel set to its highest but i still had litterally 1cm gap from the bottom of the steering wheel to the tops of my legs so as you could imagine steering was not that good as my hands kept getting stopped with tops of my legs due to hardly any cap
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,awful car no legroom in the back you can get a 2020 smart forfour eq for a lot less and has tons of legroom and only costs 15mth to service bad journalism when you dont do the full research
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,the smart is crap and its a city car you dont need a lot of room
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,aswin anbarasan agree but why offer a four seater which has limited use shame vag stopped making the upcitigomii that is a far better offering than the 500e more practical and a lot cheaper the 500e isnt worth the money
2022-12-12,CYsKSywBIys,ammaraihaan only problem is that they are still upmii a style free zone and most people for good or ill want a bit of style a year on and im still delighted with the 500e only real downside is lack of foot space but it give many smiles per mile to make up for that niggle
2022-12-12,CYsKSywBIys,bad journalism would be recommending a smart in a video about which is the best fiat 500e to buy
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,i thought the seat mii and vw eup had stopped production or am i mistaken
2022-12-13,CYsKSywBIys,they have i think some dealers still have stock though
2022-12-13,CYsKSywBIys,benrgrogan thanks ben i noticed they had disappeared from the leasing companys listing i use late last year when i was considering a replacement for my old car
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,far too much of this video focuses on features not enough of the car like how useable 24kwh is a lot more than reviewersauto journalists like to make is think
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,a few months ago i bought a 21 plate la prima for my wife and she absolutely loves it we were going to get a new icon but couldnt find one without a long wait then the used la prima was offered its excellent great tech lots of toys and dead easy to drive
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,an estate fiat 500 giardiniera was a badly missed opportunity
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,1 cost 2 range 3 proper buttons for heating etc one day hopefully i will be able to get past 1
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,your missing the smart car thats cheaper
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,but their range is less than 62 miles100 km and they are smaller than the fiat 500e
2022-12-11,CYsKSywBIys,smart forfour eq has a lot more legroom in the back compared to the 500e and real life range is about 70 miles but it does have a smaller battery
2023-10-30,xw4eNfLm0EI,its a 42kwh battery not 85
2023-09-21,xw4eNfLm0EI,no dont buy electric to expensive and battery is rubbish and also its cheaper to fill up your car with petrol electric prices are going up so it will cost more to charge them petrol and also takes hours to charge its a massive no no keep to petrol
2023-06-19,xw4eNfLm0EI,738 the trackchange button is one of the rocker switches on the back of the steering wheel spokes the other sides the volume üòä great review otherwise with excellent editing and care over composition and dialogue well done
2023-03-12,xw4eNfLm0EI,i have a question that is never addressed in these reviews are the indicators on the right hand side stalk
2023-06-19,xw4eNfLm0EI,lefthand stalk for indicators has a button on the end for deactivating the lanekeeping assistance which is useful lots of buttons back of the steering wheel has rocker switches for volume and nextprev track
2023-01-05,xw4eNfLm0EI,well seeing your asking would i have one over its rivals yes without a doubt but im a tall chap and i like a bigger car so will be setting my eyes after they are operated on for cataract removal on a skoda octavia self charging hybrid
2023-01-26,xw4eNfLm0EI,that is the only thing with the fiat 500 they only come in petite i do like skoda so im sure you will be safe with that choice
2022-12-29,xw4eNfLm0EI,im glad im not the only one that was surprised it didnt come with floor mats i was shocked when i collected my fiat 500e icon 87km that after paying for some of the extras packs they couldnt afford to add floor mats
2023-09-23,xw4eNfLm0EI,i thought it was yorkshire my favourite place to visit when i go to the uk
2022-11-20,xw4eNfLm0EI,that car looks like a suv next to you
2022-11-13,xw4eNfLm0EI,as an owner of a 2013 abarth 500 5spd and a 2015 abarth 500 6spd auto neither were a problem at all i am intrigued by this new forthcoming abarth 500 ev provided it offers improvements over the prior ice carsfor example is it quicker more torque irs improved interior front lsd and is it affordable
2023-06-19,xw4eNfLm0EI,were replacing our 2014 abarth 500c esseesse 160bhp with a topspec new fiat 500e equivalent of la prima less power and torque similar to a 14 nonturbo 500 lounge its going to be about two seconds slower 060 top speed some 30mph lower we never use top speed anyway but its a whole lot smoother and easier to drive without that awful gearbox no need for a limited slip diff as it doesnt have that surge of turbo powercant spin the wheels driving position is more comfortable seats are better its quieter and ride is smoother with the 400kg extra weight running costs will be a quarter or less our electricity is cheaper than in europe or the uk in nz we pay the equivalent of 6pkwh to charge at night when hydro power is plentiful our petrol is as expensive as yours fiat have oldtechnology batteries and motors compared to tesla so fiats ev is relatively slow and not as efficient my model 3 performance has 480bhp vs the 113bhp of the 500e yet the efficiency of the larger and heavier tesla is the same as the 500e and you can buy a used model 3 performance dual motor awd for the same money as a new 500e model 3 weighs no more than a similarlysized petrol bmw 3series awd thats probably why its such a great car multilink irs in the tesla compared to torsion beam in the 500e means theres not really any comparison in how the cars feel 500e will have that bouncy twitchy handling we know from the abarth drum rear brakes in the 500e the abarth 500e gets rear discs a bit more power 150bhp but costs even more is it worth it in the old abarth 500 compared to the lounge we had the difference in suspension tuning was obvious im not so sure that will be the case with the extra weight of the 500e platform the fiat 500e is also the same price as a brandnew basic model 3 which still has more than twice the power and 33 more range so its a nobrainer to pick the tesla better fastcharging options too reports of trim and build quality concerns are greatly exaggerated i dont think fiat will sell many 500e here basically its like buying an early nissan leaf but about five times the price and much more exclusive
2022-11-12,xw4eNfLm0EI,why do electric cars need a neutral
2022-10-27,xw4eNfLm0EI,took mine back after a week shocking battery life its a big no no went back to my petrol car
2022-10-29,xw4eNfLm0EI,hi john sorry to hear that can you elaborate on the battery life what was it like for you
2023-03-22,xw4eNfLm0EI,shetalkscars he is clearly making it up we have had laprime for half a year now and i just drove past the 5000 miles
2022-10-02,xw4eNfLm0EI,okay time to watch asa akira videos
2022-09-04,xw4eNfLm0EI,i really like it and i would love one but the price just rules it out for me looking forward to seeing the electric abarth next year i dread to think how much its going to be
2022-10-29,xw4eNfLm0EI,i like it too i think if you can get it salary sacrificeleasethrough a business it helps with the cost a lot its honestly one of my favourite small evs i think the abarth will be pricey lets see
2022-08-27,xw4eNfLm0EI,in australia were punished buying electric we get slammed with a higher tax the government are working hard to prevent evs incoming so fiat hybrids havent even been released im waiting for the day i can finally own one of these
2022-08-25,xw4eNfLm0EI,0412 that boot isnt looking small from where im looking üòè
2022-11-22,xw4eNfLm0EI,shetalkscars i may need some convincing thats hands on üòú
2022-08-14,xw4eNfLm0EI,i love everything about it but the price thankfully fiats dont hold their value ill wait 3 years and buy it used for 10k by then all the caveats and boo boos should be known
2022-09-28,xw4eNfLm0EI,second hand cars have also a second hand batteries the most expensive part of the car
2022-09-28,xw4eNfLm0EI,pt020 in 510 years you can buy one dirt cheap and put a good battery in it they wont just throw away the car who know there might very well be a different battery at tenth of the price of todays lithium banks
2022-10-29,xw4eNfLm0EI,not the same in the uk used car market is very inflated at the moment and going to take some time to go back down electric cars seem to hold their value quite well at the moment
2023-03-22,xw4eNfLm0EI,piconano in 510 years you can buy one dirt cheap and put a good battery in it lol you know the car price is due to batteries currently being very expensive biggest cost is in the battery so if you pay for new battery then its back to square one some people
2023-06-19,xw4eNfLm0EI,johns4651also on the bright side the batteries in these newer evs have temperature management and arent worked as hard as in the early nissan leaf so the 500e will probably retain its capacity well and therefore retain good value on the used market especially compared to petrol cars
2024-02-25,xw4eNfLm0EI,now in feb 2024 the uk secondhand ev market has dropped considerably and getting a 20212022 fiat 500e is running at about 12 of the original purchase price we are hoping to get one real soon as with the price down to that level they really do represent a bargain all the talk in the comments here about batteries failing is complete nonsense fortunately so we have no issue getting a secondhand car and have full confidence that the battery will last the full lifetime of the car thanks very much for the review
2022-08-08,xw4eNfLm0EI,i have a celestial blue icon i love it more than any car i have ever owned
2022-08-09,xw4eNfLm0EI,lucky lady theyre brill glad to hear youre enjoying it lovely colour too
2022-07-06,xw4eNfLm0EI,fiat has done it again another winner for a fun nippy and sharp looking small ev we need more small urban evs why hoard the battery resources when we can share with other evs i have a 2013 500e and i love it i get a range of 201 km i get a full charge in 2 hours it doesnt have dc fast charging but i dont need it as level 2 charging can get a full charge in 2 hours the best feature about this ev is the amazingly small turning circle this particular 500e was only available in california and oregon from 2013 to 2018 as a compliance vehicle for chrysler to sell their ice vehicles in the us they actually lost 14000 selling each ev i am disappointed that fiat will not import any vehicle to north america anymore including the 500e so sad you guys can enjoy the car in the uk and eu
2022-07-16,xw4eNfLm0EI,thats sad although north america does get some cool cars that the uk doesnt maybe fiat will bring something else ev to north america in the future
2022-12-31,xw4eNfLm0EI,shetalkscars fiat has just announced in the la auto show that the 500e will be available in 2024 in north america way to go fiat i suspect they will sell a lot of 500e in urban centres but in rural areas its a different ballgame a longer range suv or pickup ev will be a better choice if the charging infrastructure can improve from its present status quo ie a lack of functioning charging stations in town and along major highways
2022-06-25,xw4eNfLm0EI,i love fiat 500s
2022-09-13,xw4eNfLm0EI,shetalkscars i had a 2 cyl twin air here in oz it was great except for the shitty dualogic transmission bought a new polo but its a bit of a non event and frustrating with practically everything wish the 500 didnt cost me so much in the end got scared and sold it
2022-06-13,xw4eNfLm0EI,i love mine just had a 550km ride to amsterdam fully charged in ams during my visit there plus a short coffee stop did the job for only 21 amazingly cheap compared to fuel nowadays last but not least fully deductible win win situation
2022-06-11,xw4eNfLm0EI,first review ive heard someone mention the red option thank you üòä
2022-06-08,xw4eNfLm0EI,gorgeous what colour have you gone for jay lovely car
2022-06-08,xw4eNfLm0EI,shetalkscars we have gone for the sky blue or celestial blue i dont know what its called in english üôà we just looked at it today and its awesome although the 12v outlet in the trunk is missing and the lock buttons on the passenger side and trunk door but that was to be expected we just waited 3 months for it which is awesome because we will drive it to our holiday destination in july fun fact the hole for the 12v outlet in the trunk is there its just covered with a plastic lid we asked if the dealership can build us one inside we will see üòä the color is incredible in real life was definitely worth the 2000 extra üôà
2022-06-09,xw4eNfLm0EI,jano1998 oh beautiful that colour is gorgeous ah thats a shame but glad they could find a solution for you enjoy your holiday
2022-05-21,xw4eNfLm0EI,class ironic that the two most desirable evs on the road today are the fiat 500e and the hyundai ioniq 5
2022-05-12,xw4eNfLm0EI,bought the 118 hp 500e passion 6 months ago in rose gold and love everything it range is about 160 miles with a light foot in mixed conditions including a lot of 60 mph driving and always in onepedal range mode chose the fiat over its rivals because it has analogue controls and paid under 25k for mine
2022-05-03,xw4eNfLm0EI,awesome review abi love the history youve added into this review and the details on the 500e is really good i do like the design loving your reviews lately presenting details and video production is ace üôå

2024-05-06,crllgvMRSaM,the fiat 500e 28k to 14k in 1 year after 1000 miles driven however the arbath 595 14 tjet 24k to 18k in 1 year and 5000 miles at 40mpg the petrol for the 595 will cost 700 charging the electric will cost 220 at home or 500 at a motorway facility the 500e is great if you want to get rid of money
2024-05-06,crllgvMRSaM,how much have the electric car lobby paid you to speak positively about their scam vehicles

2024-02-05,crllgvMRSaM,finger in throat reviewer no mention that there is no space for your left foot so dont try any long journies in this milk float 32000 for a 2 seater in which he praises with grear aplomb and then criticises it for having cheap plastics and he is so into cars he couldnt find the volume control from most reviews i have read on the fiat 500e you would be lucky to get 150 miles out of a full charge they are a nice little town car but no more than that but a very expensive shopping trolley
2024-01-31,crllgvMRSaM,so lets get it sorted the cheapest 500e with a wltp of 118 miles üòÇ is 28k the same car with a 10l hybrid that has a combined mpg of 61 is 16k now it costs 10p a mile 135 for petrol so so you can go 120000 miles for on petrol for the extra 12k so whats the point seriously even if your on a super cheap ev deal with your electric supply and never ever go to a ripoff charger it will cost you more still have all the drawbacks of a ev dont pretend theres none because we all know the truth
2023-10-25,crllgvMRSaM,october 2023 fiat 500e club on facebook the high voltages in an ev requires mechanics to have safety training and special equipment may be needed in fact my nearest fiat dealer cant service my la prima because of lack of training and equipment
2023-09-22,crllgvMRSaM,quentin where did you get the idea that evs are better for the environment than ices not from robert llewelyn by any chance because he is totally deluded while we have in the uk some renewable generation they do not go to charging electric cars or heat pumps for that matter essentially electric cars are powered by gas it would be better to cut out the middle man and go for propane to power ic engines which would be far more efficient there are a large amount of losses between generation and consumer the reason is how our grid works nuclear and renewables run at maximum available at all times so cannot respond to the extra load evs put on the grid this is met by gas which can respond and provide the extra power the government put the horse before the cart they should have decarbonised the grid first but that can only be done by nuclear renewables havent a hope they are practically and technically unsuited for large scale grid supply dont take my word for it an inteligent assessment of this site shows real time grid performance httpswwwgridwatchtemplarcouk note particularly the red and blue in the second column of graphs red being gas and blue being wind and bear in mind that wind is always at maximum gas is variable and can rise to meet extra demand
2023-09-02,crllgvMRSaM,smart move to reduce the price as it was silly when launched the new mini will give the 500 some competition enjoyed the video
2023-08-29,crllgvMRSaM,its slower than many mundane cars from the sixties hardly progress
2023-08-29,crllgvMRSaM,i solove the fiat 500e its shape is just perfect but i disagreed its the best small car i have a zoe gt line and has a range of 240miles and can seat 3 in back just i paid approx 28k with renault discount at the time it has some physical controls and not all touch screen which i prefer yes its not perfect its not as good looking as the fiat call me a victor meldrew but i dont believe the high cost of small evs i wont be changing my ev any time soon but will continue to keep a close eye on fiats line up
2023-08-27,crllgvMRSaM,wish you would do more reviews quentin such a natural and fluid style and just takes me back to 90s top gear checking out the latest lexus or jaguar
2023-08-27,crllgvMRSaM,i still remember when quentin reviewed a lada riva lol
2023-08-27,crllgvMRSaM,the best objective review thank you how does it compare to some of the latest chinese evs
2023-08-26,crllgvMRSaM,34k for a small 2 seat car crazywait a couple of years and they will be half that price
2024-03-02,crllgvMRSaM,paulharrison7761 i have not my car is petrol üòé
2023-08-26,crllgvMRSaM,as an owner of a rose gold 500e with the 42 kwh drivetrain i agree with quentin most enjoyable car ive driven in half a century of motoring that includes numerous warm hatches such as the peugeot 205 gti
2024-02-07,crllgvMRSaM,totally agree with youonly a few cars have ever made me smilethis is 100 one
2023-08-26,crllgvMRSaM,its still a fiat a brand renowned for poor build quality and unreliability
2023-10-06,crllgvMRSaM,my mums had one fir years never had a days trouble so i got on if these suits me perfectly
2023-10-07,crllgvMRSaM,look again at the build quality of the all new 500e the 500e is built along side the maserati levante in the same factory in northern italy while the smaller petrol powered 500 is still made in poland we have ordered a 500e cabrio in rose oro with virtually every optional we have on our 2020 maserati levante gran sport diesel i see the same attention to fit and finish in both motor cars both are winners
2024-03-02,crllgvMRSaM,more reliable than the chargers youll be relying on though dont buy one
2023-08-26,crllgvMRSaM,i like mr wilsons reviewing style but evs cleaner air but at what price no lithium recycling facilities dirty dangerous lithium and rare earth supply chains including the sea floor licenced to be ploughed raped for more lithium the motor manufacturing industry is a corrupt shark that apparently has to keep swimming with a default position of that of liars what would suit the environment better are other forms of tech and we all keep our vehicles 1020 years but the industry just has to keep pumping out product evs emperors new clothes
2023-08-26,crllgvMRSaM,great review as always from the only car journalist who has transcended the worlds of tv car shows and youtube the 500e is selling well here in france too more cars of this size and perhaps the next notch up are needed especially now the fiesta is no longer in production
2023-08-26,crllgvMRSaM,would be greater if they made an honest 2 seater version with flat storage area
2023-08-26,crllgvMRSaM,id have one in a flash if it was just me and the wife in the house sadly and not sadly we have a full family to cart about so we need something bigger
2023-08-26,crllgvMRSaM,great review as always quentin
2023-08-26,crllgvMRSaM,looks great good to see some small cheaper evs
2023-08-25,crllgvMRSaM,quentin has not lost any of his charm great review
2023-08-25,crllgvMRSaM,please do more reviews
2023-08-25,crllgvMRSaM,still absolutely love quentins reviews so factual and honest i could listen to him reading the telephone directory remember those üòÇ
2023-08-25,crllgvMRSaM,quentins still has the same reviewing style 30 years later and im completely fine with this flashbacks to my youth watching top gear on a thursday eve
2023-08-25,crllgvMRSaM,can you review some diesel
2023-08-26,crllgvMRSaM,markustajahoyrylaiva but it makes it hard to review new diesels if there arent new models
2023-08-28,crllgvMRSaM,the whole industry is switching to electric drive trains and diesels are being phased out i think by 20302035
2023-08-25,crllgvMRSaM,still one of the best car reviewers in the business
2024-02-26,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,was it playing the theme from amarcord or had you turned it off im with those that think that the artificial engine noise is an essential safety item and you should not be able to turn it off or reduce its volume
2023-11-01,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,ok that was a good video i feel like i know what id be buying the key moment for me was the comment you made in case things go a bit fiat i think it confirms that this brand is an absolute writeoff in a lot of peoples minds me included
2023-08-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,opening windows and compromising aerodynamics is usually better than climate controls even at speeds as high as 70 mph its shocking even though it is quite noticeable at such speeds
2023-08-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,but wind noise from an open window at motorway speeds is utterly horrific
2023-07-11,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,love my 500e red edition wont go back to petrol now
2023-05-06,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i have the cabrio always get that so much more fun even in spring and fall
2023-02-09,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i enjoyed the video and for my wife that mostly drives locally and not far at that it would be a lovely car i would install a home charger and it would solve most charging problems at that nice job on the review
2023-01-06,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,in case it all goes a bit fiat said by the man who grinned like a cheshire cat after driving a 127 sport and a x19 same man who has 3 citroens 1 with a knackered engine 1 that wont run properly and 1 thats not being used in winter due to the fear of having to sweep it up with a dustpan brush come spring
2022-12-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,these electric cars should have a separate battery solely for the heaterclimate control a disadvantage though would also be having to wait to charge this battery
2022-12-21,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,fiat 500s are notorious for their electrical problems i cant imagine how horrendous this ev will be
2022-12-18,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,900 its somewhere to put the key if the battery in the key is dead so you can still start the car
2022-12-12,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,in some ways evs are good for the local businesses that are close to the chargers plus having to take a break for the batteries to recharge is good for forcing drivers to take a rest maybe more than they would have with the ices
2022-12-10,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i just cant be bothered with all the crap that you have to deal with to maximise the range which is still crap l just want to get in and get where i want to go without all that shithaving said that i i do like hubnuts reviews on the older cars
2022-12-08,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,your complaining about the stalksthats the standard config for tons of cars since the 1900s mu 2006 scion xb has the exact same config
2022-12-08,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i only worry about whats going on behind the plug what well need to do to further our power productions while simultaneously denouncing nuclear energy in so many places
2022-12-06,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i wonder how the charging infrastructure is currently planned funded and negotiated will councils or other land owners wish to get fees for allowing installation or will businesses fund chargers in their car parks to get the inevitable coffee and snack selling opportunities in rural wales i wonder which way it will go and is there a chance of very local but not at home chargers proliferating
2022-12-05,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,the anxiety associated with everything having an impact on the battery whilst driving between two points with less opportunity to recharge is perhaps a greater mental distraction than having the ice on permanently it will remain a no from me
2022-12-04,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,why do we need manual override just make it manual i dont understand the way every one wants to make things electronic
2022-12-04,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,you have to ask yourself why they are pushing ev cars its not save the planet we all know that now so what is it do they just want the elite to drive cars this all stems from the right to buy scheme they want the lower classes to use the bus it keeps us in our place much like removing free education
2022-12-03,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,great video this i think its good that youve brought this to the channel because its giving us an insight into the world of electric vehicle ownership through the eyes of someone we can all relate too in real world conditions
2022-12-03,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,yep charge network is key ive run a tesla through work for a few years and its actually ok because the network is good and reliable and doesnt need cardsloginsdongles etc its also high output and the software in the car plans the routes of long journeys for you pretty well to keep charging stops brief the chargers also discourage people from sitting on them which helps with availability im sad they didnt keep the range extender type cars going we have an i3 as the run around yes its a hybrid but its the other way round ie a serial hybrid and as a result you dont end up using petrol at all often as most journeys are less than 100 miles in reality plus on a long run you can just use fuel for the faster bits its easy to refill and will run all day if needed you always have full power as the drive is purely electric unless you really run the battery low the weight penalty makes only a very little difference to economy and the petrol engine can be quite basic as it just needs to generate electricity but mainly you can avoid using public chargers
2022-12-03,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,so seats made from recycled coke bottles just dont drop some mintos on them
2022-12-03,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i simply dont ever go for lunch or grab a coffee at services or other places where there may be public chargers the thought of constantly adding an hour to my journey does not appeal and a meal at services for a couple is going to add 1520 at least to the cost of that journey probably a lot more than what you may have saved in fuel though services charging isnt that cheap anyway i bloody detest motorway services and only ever nip in to them for the loo the thought of spending an hour there fills me with dread
2022-12-03,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,hubnut a real world test will be interesting ian as i said elsewhere in the comments this year we drove 1500 miles through rural france and i dont think an ev would have been practical or even possible for us excluding the initial purchase price an ev would only work as a second vehicle for local commuting and then cheaper home charging
2022-12-03,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,a car like this would only make sense for us as a second car with home charging capability our autumn trip through france doing 1500 miles just would not have been feasible or at the very least unbelievably inconvenient
2022-12-03,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,im not keen on electronic hand brakes they are on the cars i use at work i think id also not get on with all this driver assistance either too much like a bossy nagging partner seems like the backseat driver just got in the front and made me sit in the back as for the push button for the doors i hope it doesnt operate when the vehicle is in motion because that could be a serious safety concern
2022-12-03,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,good video reviewthis type of car price point what they offer is the sorta thing many of us will end up withor their replacements the initial cost of the 500 e is too high though especially considering its limited size as well public charging like thati dont have that much free time the range isnt enough not even in long range mode i know people will say its designed for local trips onlybut we arent made of moneytheres a recession on and we will need cars like this and cheaper in the future to double that range so they can be used as an only carmuch like we can do now with small petrol city cars little things to note my 2019 honda can read texts and allow me to use voice recognition to reply its a gimmickused it once doesnt work with other types of messaging eg whats app i also have led dipped headlights as well as led running lights rear lights quite surprised to see that fiat with that price tag only having halogen headlights my auto wipers are mostly good and sensible software means the rear wipe works normally at anytime and will auto wipe on reverse if the front wipers set to auto got the sensitivity adjustment as well not perfect tho collision warning and auto brake upto 30mph lane departure warning but doesnt take control of the steering cruise control manual automatic speed limiters speed sign recognition used for automatic im torn at the moment wether next time to go hybrid or jump directly to full electric depends on prices range charge times of batteries at that time expect if no better than now would prob go hybrid next few years critical also theres a cut off for new petrol diesels at the end of this decadehybrids have an extra 5 years with this in mind if we all wait til the last chance saloon they wont be able to make supply electric vehicles fast enough to meet demandexpect a long wait jump to early and you might be buying a model closer to this fiat which will by then be old hat technology with rubbish rangemaybe if it all comes together in next few years current petroldiesels will be next to worthless if it doesnt come together but gov still imposes the banyour current petrol diesel cars will be highly desirablevalues will soar and desperate people will be taking them without permission a 3rd outcome is that technology doesnt progress fast enough and gov move the ban to say 2040
2022-12-02,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,my issue with electric cars isnt the purity its purely environmental the battery has a lifespan of 100000 miles tops before needing replacement the lithium cobalt and nickel used in the batteries is mined in horrific working conditions often using child slave labour at gunpoint the environmental impact of this is huge while ev lithium ion batteries are supposedly 95 recycleable less than 5 of ev batteries are actually recycled the effects of lithium cobalt nickel etc when returning to the earth are slightly less horrific than the child slave labour but still really bad nickel mining alone is eating away at the rainforest and if the plans to make roads fully electric in the nearish future suceed it will accelerate this process 10 fold actually a lot more than tenfold but you get the point they are not sustainable or a long term solution and rely on third world countries with abhorent working conditions for production spending 510k for a replacement battery after anywhere between 25100k miles is financially and enviromentally stupid considering how many dirty diesels have done 250000 miles with basic maintenence hell most service diesels see 400k 1000000 with regular maintenence also not to mention that our electricity grid is barely holding up as is and is not nearly renewable enough it is simply not feasible for mass ownership as of now if you want to minimize pollution of cars which itself is a tiny figure of global pollution private jets cause more pollution than all of fucking denmark combined for example and thats still a small drop in the ocean figure out how to lower diesel tailpipe emissions as the compression ratios are high enough to run on non fossil fuels if you want to do your bit through what you drive buy a car any car new old diesel petrol etc and look after it the consumer throwaway culture is maddening to me personally petition for the government to auction off the cars held under the 2008 scrappage scheme even just for parts which ruined the 2nd hand car market effecting the poorest the most and generally being a senseless waste of perfectly adequate equipment tldr if you want to drive an ev because you enjoy it no worries just dont makebe fooled by the pretenses that it has any positive effect whatsoever on the planet thanks for coming to my ted talk
2022-12-02,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,didnt think lithium mining was anywhere near rainforest isnt argentina one of the main producers also 100000 is definitely not the limit for battery life plenty of evs have clocked up way more miles on their original battery
2022-12-02,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,hubnut rainforests in south america asia are rife with minerals like that i think i mistyped in the original lithium mining is mostly south american whereas nickel and cobalt is more asianafrican however the working conditions are simmilarly poor in all places ethanol production is also a huge contributor to deforestation mostly south america though ethanol fields are quickly eating up north american farmland im honestly glad to hear the battery life is better than i had heard im not so much an ev connoseiur so such news is reassuring i was just using figures id found from online sources over the years imo its far more of a political issue all around environment gov sanctions on petroldiesel muh freedoms etc than a fundamental issue with evs they definitely have their pros and i think a lot of people who live in a city would probably be better off with a small ev or even a quadrocycle or gwiz or something for their shop runs instead of a massive crossover as a side note love the content great watch as always keen for what the new year will bring
2022-12-02,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i dont know hubnuts personal circumstances but i assume he would have off street parking which would probably mean if he owned an ev he could rig up a 240v 13a charge point shed or house roof mounted solar panels really make a lot of sense even in a rain blighted place like wales particularly when you own an ev
2022-12-02,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,nope home charging is not something i can do where i live youd need a pretty big solar array to charge an ev
2022-12-01,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,absolutely love the theory of it and a lovely looking little car bit too vauxhall adam imo compared to the original new 500 rather have an old fashioned 500 hybrid frankly at this stage charging is a faff and we are still not at a point where if we want to we can load up the car and nip off somewhere up north and it not take 12 hours to get there thats the deal breaker for me not keeping 3 small kids occupied while we charge up a large enough vehicle lol how fiat set up their auto wipers is a right pain though 500x is particularly annoying in that they werent even standard and even when optioned dont work properly attaching function of the rear to the fronts is just daft
2022-12-01,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,ive got one one on subscription from elm 140 is about right i found the range mode to jerky
2022-12-01,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,in case things go a bit fiat
2022-12-01,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,lets be honesteventually we will all have to have electric carsfor me at the moment its a no go as cant charge it home of worki am looking at modern hybridsbut will keep a gas guzzling classic for as long as i can
2022-12-01,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,do all the cars come with a parrot as standard
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,you dont get the joy of hearing your engine burst into life on a cold morning evs take the fun out of driving
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i remember my first ev experience riding in a colleagues nissan leaf the figures would not suggest its particularly fast when he put his foot down out of the carpark it took off like a scalextric car no delay quite vicious acceleration aside from a v8 supercharged mercedes slk ive not been in anything quicker between 0 to 40 porsche boxster and aston martin v8 vantage included it was a similar story in the back of a hyundai kona only that felt like it was losing traction and a bit wayward and that was still pulling like a train at 60
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,that indicatorlight stalk does look like one i had in an alfa mito i had a big issue sometimes when indicating at night completely turned off the headlights this was somewhat scary on a dark country road quickly fixed but scary all the same hopefully theres a bit more resistance needed to change the light settings now
2022-12-08,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i have the same stalk config in my 2006 scion xb and never had an issue
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,having had an ampera which is probably the only realistically priced electric car you can buy charging only works if you can do it at home a granny charger is ok for that if you only travel a few tens of miles a day at 10a everywhere else the cost of parking was more than the cost of charging and made it as pricey as petrol now with electric at 32p a kwh rather than 12p when i had my ampera these cars just arent cheap to run anymore
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,good real world review i dont have access to home charging either so its interesting to see how youre getting on i think in the future people will just charge their car whilst doing the weekly shop
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,another great video really enjoying the 500e content theres another cup holder in the front if you havent found it it pulls down front just below the parking brake button
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,as always a great honest review and interesting insight into electric car ownership thanks ian and miss hubnut i like the idea of the onto way that you can rent the car on a month by month basis it gives potential owners the try before you buy option im a bit on the fence with electric cars i love the clever engineering behind them but am concerned about their end of life recyclability as well as the fact their labelled emission free which they arnt really one other concern is the battery life a current petrol or diesel car is designed to have a life of say 10 to 15 years most evs and hybrids seem to have battery issues within 10 years and when the battery needs replacing its a write off due to the fact the battery is basically the floorpan of the car i have never been in a position to own a new car i think the newest was 6 years old due to the cost so if i decided to go electric then i run the risk of a battery towards the end of the cars life hopefully i will be proven wrong and future batterys will be more recyclable and last longer i think electric cars have their place but are not the future i think hydrogen powered cars are the future using fuel cell power its an exciting time to be an automotive engineer thats for sure
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,always love watching your reviews and so much better than any other channel as you test in real conditions and in a very relaxed manner i was a little sceptical about evs until i worked a few years at a main nissan renault dealership and drove many leafs zoes and others its the lack of any noise that surprises you as well as maximum power available immediately like many the only thing that prevents me from buying one is the initial cost and range anxiety it would mix well though with the occasional use of my old classic but very thirsty volvo which we currently run with a toyota yaris hybrid which is great to drive in town and ultra reliable like most toyotas
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,great review i love the whole idea of evs but to be practical i will need around 200 miles of theoretical range and sadly i will also need a secondhand vehicle with a purchase price of less than 12k and with no stupid hidden extras like the battery hired so i think im probably going to have a longish wait the closest i can see at present is the mg but whether the secondhand price will fall rapidly enough for me to ever own one before i finally hang up my motoring hat in about 15 years we shall have to wait and see
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,recently got given a e transit whilst my work van was in for service my first experience of electric life boy was it fast but boy was it not efficient i was getting 16 mpk miles per kilowatt glad to see had to drive to cambridge from norwich cost me 45 for 78 miles as it was 67 p per kw i believe car are there but infrastructure isnt and needs to be made universal as some could charge i some areas
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,great down to earth everyday not just a review on the vehicle but also the day to day situation of living with a electric car btw although in your situation it wouldnt make sense to put a charger at home what are the general costs if having a vehicle comparable charger put at home
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,good review like yourself i love electric cars but and its a big one the cost to buy lease timeshare one does not offset the cost of fuel for a car you already own however if you were looking at getting a new car anyway then electric has to be a very strong contender one like the 500 ev would suit most peoples daily driving needs
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,well i was suggesting this ten years ago wish id copyrighted the idea now it was only a matter of time before someone added noise httpsyoutube_efx35gpuky
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i do like evs even being a diehard petrolhead the sheer cost is the main prohibitive factor what i really take issue with is how the government and users claim they are saving the planet with such vehicles and ice cars are evil and should be stamped out on both counts very wrong facts ev and ice ideally with synthetic fuels should live in harmony to provide the best of both worlds people need to look at the whole thing more but i digress great video ian and interesting take on living with an ev
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i love the little 500e if we didnt need a bigger boot for mams wheelchair id absolutely be buying one have to admit i know evs do get a bit of a hard time from people whove never even sat in one but i genuinely think if more people would give them a go they really are great to own both our cars are now ful ev and i fully realise that they wont suit everyone but i just wish more people would give them a try before laying into them
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,a brand new car on hub nut anyone else wanting to know more about that sexy little red number behund it
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,im sure there will be a menu to change the rear wiper from mirroring to not linked also the step of intermittent time i had a corsa d that had menus to customise and the corsa d is a punto basically
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,around 2 kg of lithium in an eevee that can be recycled when its at the end of its life just like with 25 kg of lead in your current car battery is recycled so if youre going to complain about lithium mining for 2kg you should be complaining about crude oil which will use 10000kg in your car lifetime which isnt recyclable this is an answer to all those smug answers about im keeping my old car
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,a very interesting review thanks üôÇ
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,anthropogenic extinction is going to be hell thank you for review now we need to ban toxic ice burning asp
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,thats a shame the gas powered 500 is being phased out i enjoyed driving the fiat 500 loaner car that the ford dealership gave me when my 2012 fiesta was in the shop under warranty years ago it was a fun car to drive i almost bought one but could not come to the agreement with the dealer on it i like evs but i have no way to consistently charge it up i live in a town house so no charger installation at my house is possible and i dont feel like haunting the local charger at the market all the time i also dont like the idea of wait times for charging when it takes 10 mins to fill up my 2018 hyundai and i am off and running plus evs are expensive and i dont feel the need to replace my 2018 hyundai which has less then 17000 miles on it for one and make payments i think evs are fine for folks that have a way to charge them at home but for 90 of the usa driving population it is not feasible
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i did not know the fiat 500 was gaspowered is it lpgcng or perhaps hydrogen
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,pleased see more evsüòÅ no frounk not keen on fwd bit slow low range mmm fiat 500 could try harder üòâ
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,day to day use the ev is king
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i enjoy your reviews of electric vehicles you actually drive the cars in their intended mode and review the features fairly more factories need to listen to pragmatic feedback rather than relying on target group analysis you remind me of the wise old mouse in aesops fable when he asked but who will put the bell on the cat
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,very fair review that mirrors my own experience of living with a fiat 500e for a year especially the part about the enjoyment of onepedal driving with a light foot i get 4 miles per kwh in mixed driving but i would definitely not have bought an ev if i couldnt charge from home due to the lack of rapid chargers where i live in central scotland
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,quadruple the range and id be interested
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i personally wouldnt have an ev i dont see it as the complete answer although it does have a place throwing away the internal combustion engine with over a century of development behind it isnt the answer either the real problem is the fuel they use petroldiesel what is needed is an alternative fuel that doesnt pollute
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,steam engines had 200 years of development before they were discarded
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,there are a few more internal combustion engines than steam engines
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,parknest yes 100 years later and now we are going to stop making internal combustion engines and there wont be many left in a few decades
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,come on ian since when does a man of your age listen to radio 1 üòÇ you gotta stop trying to be trendy and down with the kids üòâ electric car and mark goodier this month and an electric scooter next at this rate üòÇ
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,what i find perplexing is that these electric cars dont all have solar generating roofspanels seems a missed opportunity to my engineers mind i guess this video has paid for a set of brake shoespads for the rest of the fleet eh üòàüòâ im a bit worried that your costs per mile are going to start having to include price of the coffees you are consuming while waiting for it to charge up
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,it cost thousands to make a curved panel and it barely adds 1 mile per day of range they are also heavy
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,prices starting at 30k you can get two petrol 500 pops for that 15k each the prices of ev are just way too high
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,great review ian its obviously very proficient at what it does and fiat have put a great deal of thought into it i love the styling inside and out and it all seems userfriendly such a short wheelbase is bound to be a bit bouncy particularly as the italians will set up the suspension for handling hence a bit firm with no roll try it on the road where you did the 2cv hoon down to reservoir a few years ago
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,great to see you in this car and get your take on where its all heading the onto option bring s affordability here where i expect prices will fall in a few years and of course by then there will used evs out there too great content thank you
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,good review of a normal electric car ive sadly come to the conclusion that the larger electric vehicles are bought on outright performance rather than environmental concerns teslas and audis are driven where i live with utter irresponsibility
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,great review just what a prospective owner needs youve never alluded to your telepathic abilities before no other explanation as to how you knew i was watching on the tv rather than tablet watched again today so i can make this comment that steering wheel looks nice and chunky to hold i think those people that are able to need to rethink attitudes to evs evs for daily and keep ice for leisure a place for both my home town in a survey last year was listed as in the top 10 worst big towns for public chargers in the country majority are in 3 multistory carparks and car dealers no street chargers
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,its really valuable to have an honest review from someone i can relate to not someone constantly comparing what theyre driving to a new tesla or jaguar ipace sadly there is as yet no way i could afford any ev other than a ten year old leaf with a range of 500 yards
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,that fiat computerised rear wiper interval really is a struggle i have a 2016 fiat doblo it doesnt have autowipers the rear wiper just wipes once every two sweeps of the front wipers however if you dont have the front wipers on it doesnt pick the slowest speed it wipes as if it was syncing with the front wipers on low continuous speed which is way too fast for just wiping spray the interval for both the front and rear wipers is also nonadjustable but speeddependant so at higher speeds theres very little difference between interval and low speed while at slower speeds the interval is sometimes too slow but it doesnt rain enough to select low speed continuous my previous car 2001 volvo v70 had adjustable interval from very very slow to alsmost continuous on the front wipers and two stages of rear wiper a nice mediumslow interval and continuous i liked that a lot better ow and to top it all off my doblo has the same wiper stalk situation as a multipla you have to twist the end for the front wipers and a ring for the rear wiper the stalk itself just moves up for one front wipe to the dash for rear wash to the driver for front wash
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i cant wait to get an ev no moving parts nice and simple to maintain plus better for the environment currently the majority of cars are scrapped due to the engine being uneconomical to repair hopefully with simplicity of evs they will last much longer
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i read somewhere that the service interval on the tesla electric motor is 1 million miles
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,never get the oh just have a coffee while charging i want to go somewhere and come back not endlessly handing around waiting on the car to charge
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,true but it is a good idea to stop every two hours something im notoriously bad at doing if the car allows me to just keep going
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,ah ha this lecky vid is an extension from yesterdays whimsical hippy response to the announced london ulez expansionamong with other british cities like most luvvies who dance to the tune of who ever pays them it seems that youre desperately trying to explain and discretely justify your acceptance of the kings shilling for lecky overpriced overrated plastic imported hypocritical nonsense will be amusing when your local council brings in a low emmision zone and perhaps youll see how it really feels eh
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,getting our tesla 3 on 1412 charge at home for 10pkwh with octopus works out at around 2p per mile no servicing ever apart from topping up washer bottle pollen filter every 20000 miles a 40 mpg cmax would cost 2600 for 12k miles the tesla 26700 no contest at all home charger pays for itself in months
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,tyres every 5000 miles it looks like youve fully swallowed the middle class imported battery car wet dream
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,toonmag50 im 6500 miles into my ev journey and tyres look brand new where have you plucked the 5000 mile figure from the worst car i have ever had for tyre wear was a rover 200vi lucky to get 8k from the fronts
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,magicrat yes yes and you replaced your rover with a bmw cos their sooooo fab similar yarns all over you tube yawn howevertesla original tyres are bespoke to them as if you fit normal tyres theyll only last 5000 miles didnt you know obviously not or you can pay 2500 for a replacement set of tesla tyres mind you lecky zealots like you and me rest of the middle class who are prepared to pay 60000 for a us placka pretend car wont mind paying 2500
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,toonmag50 i currently drive a model 3 only ever had 1 bimmer bit of a disappointment tbh the tesla oe michelin ps4 silent tyres are around 200 from kwik fit had a puncture the first week i had it and had to get one ordered in a similar price to the tyres on my last 4 cars to confirm as of today i have covered 6141 miles and the tyres are in excellent condition the windscreen however seems to made of sugar glass and chips at the drop of a hat this is my personal experience maybe i have just been lucky
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,fiat electronics certainly dont need a collision to fail time is all it takes and often not much
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,fantastic real world review of the 500e one of the better looking ev looks interesting with good build quality good to know about the charging network i would of thought these are going to have to get better in the coming months and years with the government pushing for more evi guess eventually they will tax the charging stations like they do at present for petrol and diesel otherwise they are going to lose a lot if revenue great review thank you to you both
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,excellent review like you my household run around in older petroldiesel vehicles like you i like evs and would love one like you i live in rural wales pembrokeshire main reasons i dont have an ev cost they are too expensive for me and range i regularly drive from pembrokeshire to the new forest to visit family 4 to 45 hours with a 10 minuet comfort break in our old clio i can get there run around and get back on a tank of petrol without out refuelling if i do need fuel it only takes 5 minuets maybe 10 if all pumps are in use and not 45 evs are getting cheaper and the charging infrastructure is improving but its not good enough yet
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,you are an anomaly a petrolhead that likes evs so much that you manage to make them work in a rural setting where they make the least amount of sense i like my diesel hatchback just fine but i live in a town large enough to have a rush hour and would be interested in a small light cheap ev with puny range to do the shopping with i think bmw i3 is kind of cool with its usage of carbon fibre but its still pretty expensive and compromises weight by trying to have long range maybe you can review an i3 in about 15 years im certainly looking forward to it
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,the ultimate hubnut car would be an early new york taxi originally and before henry ford poked his nose in electric was the norm in terms of technological advance who uses film or vinyl record on a daytoday basis and yet you can still play vinyl and for that matter cassettes and i still undertake photography projects with rolls of film and i use a handheld light meter setting the camera and lens manually sometimes i even use black and white film üòØüòÇ on balance technological advance is not bad but just an alternative
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i looked at full electric but lack of charge points and the difficulty of getting a charger at home was one of the main reasons i went with phev going round rural lincolnshire watching the range deplete rapidly is something i wasnt wanting to experience
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i had an outlander phev great car which turned out to be a gateway drug into full ev üòä i dont understand the people who bemoan phevs they are absolutely the best solution for some people and dont get me started on the ev owners who complain about phevs using public chargers
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i dont know im neither f√≥r nor √†gainst evs nor am i either f√≥r nor against petrol driven cars i just enjoy the content from hubnut and cars in generalüòé
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,not having access to your own reasonable capacity home charging installation will very much colour your experience you will weary of novelty of lingering while public charging i do understand your are under inclusive program structure practical constraints for your trial project interesting following your impressions
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,im sorry to say it to you but this is the worst hubnut test ever boring boring boring
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,one car that is on my shopping list for next year major downside for me is the driving seat you only get height adjustment on the top spec having said that the convertible appeals
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,903 i dont know this car well enough however most vehicles with keyless start have a pad somewhere so that when the key battery is flat you can touch the key for the car to recognise the key often its on the steering column or around the starter button or randomly in the centre armrest like on mitsubishi
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i dont think its hatered iain its the reterick on which they are being introduced to countries to say they will save the world is bollocks as the mear manufacturer disposal of electric cars is beyond explaining how indeed you could called them efficient when using cole powered stations that produce the electricity to change them not to mention safety issues with fire as you know the abilities to be functional in larger countries is laughable 199 kilometres is down the bloody road in australia
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,we dont use anywhere near as much coal here as australia less than 1 of our power is coalfuelled
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,hubnut good luck with affordable heating this winter wake up our world is in real danger if not for you then your childrentake care
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,what a horrible little piece of pointless tatt without an engine its of no interest to me when the day comes you can only have electric thats the day me and cars are over
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,this is the type of car reviews that i like you have the car for a month and use it in all conditions great insite ian
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,what a cool little car im actually quite happy watching someone whos opinion i trust doing a review on these things as it is more or less inevitable that one day we will be forced to use one as a daily and keep the classics for special occasions only also wales is more like the terrain i drive on here in nz so any results you get are more likely to be closer to what i would get myself so 140 miles 230km approx in rangeand you have a network that supplies free charging which will never happen here due to habits of the political nature that sounds perfectalthough i would like to see something closer to 400km minimum so i can get to whitianga and back 320km without having to stop at the closest topup point about 85km short of my destination and a 5km diversion to top up both on the way there and back this might not be possible in a smaller car as yet but they will get there about the time i want a car that size love the appearance of quality on the interior tactile surfaces and that door chonk certainly sounds good too how do recycled plastic seats feel to sit on it will be interesting to see how they last and whether they eventually crumble or melt in the hot summer sun uv potentialand whether they burn ones thighs in summer like the old vinyl seats do it sounds good in theory thoughand the car looks to be a fairly practical one for a twoperson household but you couldnt go shopping with the kids on board eh great review from the pair of you much obliged all the best
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,gov will load up road tax and electricity price go into orbitthen sheep realise they been shafted and left with a hugely devalued piece of rubbish
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,nice looking car i have to say the interior is a bit spoiled by the big ugly screen stuck in the middle like an afterthought wish it was an option to have no screen
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,electric cars brilliant in rural areas if you can charge at home mine is usually 90 wind powered and 10 hydro going by my local grid
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,im completely with you regarding how much fun evs are to drive i have the added bonus of living in a province where electricity is still very cheap and clean and government incentives are high unfortunately in its slow death fiat canada has not seen fit to import the 500e in fact only the standard 500x is currently catalogued
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,evs have been rather forcefed and forced upon people who use vehicles but i predict that they will a 25 year fad at most at least the full battery ones it is no coincidence that toyota honda suzuki the koreans and numerous us companies are developing hydrogen cells or straight hydrogen gas because of the ultimate limitations and rarity of battery materials we shall see this go hand in hand with green power generation being stored without chemical batteries and heavy commercial vehicles needing something akin to icus we see this is trains already and russia with japan is reserving whole islands in its far east for energy generation and storage when blue red or green hydrogen reaches the right scale of economic production then battery cars will cease and will have been an interesting stopgap
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,a nice looking over priced golf cart
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,have you driven a mitsubishi i imiev in the us that seems like a perfect blend of ev and crude nugget for your channel lol though the extremely low range probably makes that car one of the most rare earlier evs
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i havent was considering a czero badgeengineered version but the short range was a bit offputting
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,hubnut would be nice if somebody would design some way to put much better batteries in older evs to keep them viable iirc there was a company in portland oregon that puts newer much larger capacity batteries in early leafs e v rides but thats only possible because nissan upgraded the later leaf and that battery can be made to work in older ones just through dumb luck of part sharing i guess
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,ian firstly l agree with you on the design of the fiat 500 of all the retro cars with the exception fiat got it right the first time l saw one they got it so right the only real gripe l have with it no spare tyre not even a space saver l think a luxury item you can get on most 4x4 and comercial vehicles is full size spare tyre an essential part in australia especially
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,great to see an ev review mrh its been a while keep them coming its good to see your realworld experiences
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,purchase price range and having to plan any trip around charge points are a real negative for me and id be interested to know what sort of trade in value an ev would command
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,no contingency for driving into a pond and getting out when your electricks go kaput i guess its low odds but then shouldnt the natural response to driving 60mph in a metal box be to scream were all going to die
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,news your current car will conk out if you drive it into a pond
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,ive been distracted flairside tranny photo im sure ive driven petrol v6 thudly
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,neither are original fiat 500 all the electrics are failing
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,enjoyable and interesting test i am and always have been a car bus truck bike train enthusiast and it doesnt matter how theyre propelled
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,has anyone informed british layland that fiat has stolen the sherpa name üòâ
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,charging infrastructure is woeful in wales the government had a big role out of fast chargers last year and installed 22kwh chargers hardly fast
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,if the electric fiat 500 is a brand new platform why is the ride still as awful as the ic version manufacturers are in a transitional stage which means all were going to get for the next few years are experimental partsbin frankensteins
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,hubnut a search of suspension parts for the new 2020 fiat 500e appears to show the front arms are compatible with the lancia ypsilon from 2011
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,if you get down to 0 miles range you will have 1012 miles in tortoise mode audible or visual warning which gives one miles to get off a motorway at 30 mph automatically slowly reducing or to a charge point there is one dedicated ev rescue company that will do a roadside charge at 75 kwh diesel generator with enough to get you to a charge point the rac also do that the others recover the vehicle either to a charge point your destination if closer than a charge point or back home but the electronic handbrake is a problem as when at absolute zero in the battery completely dead it comes on once stationary and cant be released until some juice back in it a lift onto a flatbed is needed
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,it looks pleasant enough to drive but the charging business is still too much of a faff for me i am not ready
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i like the look of it and as a city car it makes sense especially the one pedal driving i live in a rural area and the very fact you good folks need to plan charging take into account hills and heater power consumption immediately is a red flag for me in terms of practicality i have a friend with an electric car who twice has been low on charge due to charger availability when they had an urgent need to collect the kids from school 5 10 mins at a petrol station suits me better for now
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,too much tech for my liking and i loathe manufacturers electrifying things like doors and handbrakes just headaches in the future when they go wrong
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,looks very nice and greatbut one thing worries me is that display unit showing you all about whilst driving distraction
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,the little fiat looks sound but still the charging is a faff infrastructure isnt ready yet in my opinion
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,im not anti ev but id have such range anxiety and its not a 5 mins trip to the fuel station to fill it up i guess things will improve over time but ill never own one
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,hubnut that it does yes though i think its just as pointless on those cars as well if you have a mechanical release thats known to be very reliable generally and does the exact same function why would anyone need to add electronic releases in the first place i find a lot of things like that with modern cars im not against modern cars but theres this trend to add things that arent really necessary in my eyes backup cameras for example i understand how theyre useful on large commercial vehicles like trucks or vans or big suvs but here in north america theyve been mandated on every vehicle why does something like a small crossover or hatchback need a backup camera its not large so should be fairly easy to park using the rear view mirror or side mirrors in places like here in canada where poor winter weather means that cameras are just going to get covered with slush and snow and ice as youre driving or salt spray thats kicked up from behind the car on wet winter roads the camera lens is going to get all dirty and blurry and useless anyway but a plain old rear view mirror inside that has done its job perfectly acceptably for decades is not let alone the repair cost if your rear view mirror breaks you just glue another one to your windshield if youre backup camera breaks its likely hundreds and hundreds of dollars to repair at least here in canada led headlight assemblies are another example im not against leds as they provide superior light put modern cars have the leds embedded in the assembly meaning if one of the leds burns out you have to spend potentially hundreds or even thousands on expensive cars to replace the entire assembly for one burnt out led why not design the housings to have replaceable led bulbs that use the same standard sockets and contacts that weve had for decades rather than spending thousands to replace the entire assembly you could just swap the bulb out as weve done but still have the benefit of leds sorry for the mini rant haha just some observations ive had
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,dont worry about running out of charge there are breakdown companys that will come to the rescue with a diesel generator
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,not my cup of tea either paulie neither is the car driving me with its supposed safety features surely these things are taking the skill out of driving or am l being just an old fart that is stuck in the past lol
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i wonder how much cheaper in fuel this will be to run compared to a petrol equivalent doing 50mpg considering you need to use commercial chargers
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i worked out that at current prices public chargers work out about the same as a 50mpg diesel
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,hubnut im not surprised even though theres hardly any tax on electricity is there vat on commercial pump electrickery electric cars are going to be very expensive to run if using commercial charging points when tax is raised to collect the equivalent of the tax on liquid fuel today which must happen over the next few years and certainly by 2030
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,hubnut i should mention that for the business traveller working for a vat registered company that already makes the electric car more expensive than diesel they claim 20 back from hmrc on their fuel plus average modern diesel cars easily exceed 50mpg on a run
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,had ev car as a courtesy car while my company car was in for service i can do over 200 miles a day cant stop to change for hours the car was good but getting the car back to the garage i had ten miles range left did not ring it neck out got regen when i could did not trust it as my daily work horse
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,passed a hyundai stuck on the hill out of llwyncelyn the other day where you pass regularly that had presumably run out of charge when i came back it had moved into the layby the other side of the road with the assistance of the aa van and man i wonder though how it moved from there its not as if they could get a couple of gallons of petrol from the filling station 250metres back down the road i guess that they might have had to pay a truck to carry the car to a charger somewhere possibly 20 miles away at aberystwyth
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,a great update on the electric 500 journey ian and carly what really makes this is the real world use of the car in suboptimal conditions for an ev great work and i look forward to more real world life with a small ev many thanks for sharing
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i urge you to research the hyundai bayon fascinating little car and i can honestly say from experience its a little starif not a tad quirky looking
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,our local charger in oxford is part of franklin energy which is listed as being supported by shell recharge which is free for onto users
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,and what exactly is powering the charging coal gas nuclear consider these things as an electric car is an utter lie
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,in the uk past year was 43 fossil fuels renewables 34 nuclear 17 but the environment isnt my main motivation to drive one i just like evs
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,you said that the 500e was controversial how can such a gorgeous car be so i love it and if it was a fraction larger i would get one one thing that would annoy me would be having the one pedal driving only available in eco mode why cant it be available in the other modes too it is such a good feature to have in an ev much underrated i think i can concur that the charging infrastructure in wales is lagging behind the rest of the country my family and i went to south wales from shropshire for a holiday this summer and we went cross country the levels of anxiety reached exceeded any i have experienced in an ev i think it may have been at around the same time you transferred twk to its new home as we experienced torrential rain too we were ok once in and around carmarthen but decided to take the less scenic motorway route back to save our nerves looking forward to the forthcoming additional 500e reports
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,in range mode it feels much like normal mode in terms of power but with stronger regen to allow that onepedal driving sherpa dulls the power a little but you can always accelerate through it by just flooring it if you feel the need to get a shift on
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,hubnut thanks ian i have a kia soul ev in which you can also override the dulled power delivery in eco mode to get full power when needed trouble is it doesnt feel as nice as the responsiveness when in normal i imagine the 500e might be the same
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,jwsoaresjones1560 you will have to trawl through some more hubnut to answer this ill get you started twk is the letters of the registration of hubnuts invacar enjoy
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i have a petrol 500 cost 10685 with 25 miles and 2 months old list price was about 14000 at the time the website shows the 500e at 30000 plus dont show the lower priced one anymore i have only done 7200 miles in 35 years so in theory the car would be great for me pottering about locally but i could buy an awlful lot of petrol for the extra cost these are even the honda e is getting on for 30000 i would love one just for the quietness and auto but not at that price
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,appreciate the honest review whilst evs will work for some i dont think theyre quite ready to replace the internal combustion engine theres too many compromises that need to be made having to chose between heating and range is a choice i dont think anyone should be forced to make i still believe that evs are just a stepping stone until we get to the long term replacement for the combustion engine whether thats hydrogen or even synthetic fuels neither or which seem to get much attention due to costs but i wonder where wed be if they got the same sort of investment and development as evs
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,the fiat brand was removed from our market in 2020 low sales i hear the 500e will return in 2024 its 11 c today and will be 15 c tomorrow overnight lows at 24 c we shall see how they fare here butnot looking promising
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,stephenholland5930 western canada north alberta batteries lose 30 of the charge in the winter here below minus 18 c even petrol engines need block heaters for overnight in cold weather
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,automatic wipers headlights and reverse camera are really the 3 modern car conveniences i like seems like a great little car would love one especially as my first car was a 1967 fiat 500
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,excellent review someone at work has one of these and it really attracts attention however im clearly showing my age here but i really hate all these information overload screens and a lack of real dials not a computer graphic of same some time ago i rented an amgline mercedes aclass and it was to me anyway utterly hateful the lane departure nonsense which scared the crap out of me the first time it kicked in and helpfully told me how much braking force it had applied the screens that you could change the theme of and all the touchscreen nonsense no thanks maybe someone needs to design an ev for old fuddyduddies like me who just want dials to read and knobs to turn i do like onepedal driving though
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i agree 100 and if you turn a feature off it needs to stay off until you turn it on again why is looking at a mobile phone whilst driving considered dangerous whilst touch screens flashing warnings at you arent
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,cornishhh iirc the rented aclass i used as an illustration did that off only until you turned the ignition off a corsa i rented stayed off until switched back on it does worry me that people seem to be keen to hand control of their vehicles to computer systems even simple stuff like automatic wipers and headlights a foggy day seems to fool the latter on many cars with touchscreens i find im looking more at the screen trying to guide my finger onto the target area for a function than i am the road yet i can easily do the same function by feel and without taking my eyes off the road when there are knobs or switches
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i would not want an electric car as a presentwhen i go anywhere i dont want to continuesly doing the math to see what im doing and will i ever get home again because some charger is not working i have a fuel gauge in mine i can telli think that electric cars are nothing but a pipe dream they dont workok for someone beatleing around town but no good at all for anyone doing milagecrap burn them all go buy a good euro 6 diesel
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,are the washers referred to as multijet great video makes me want to get my electric car sooner you raise a good question which you could answer more range with climate control on and windows closed or climate control off and windows open i think mythbusters performed a test on petrol engined cars once and windows closed ac on was more economical lots of information in this video
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,it depends on speed the faster you go the more the drag created by the open windows matters
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i just love this car
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,anxiety would not let me drive an electric ev there is too much to worry about
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,see i still cant justify this scheme for the sort of money this fiat costs a month i could get a more substantially better hybrid ok not brand new but still fairly new over 48 months including running costs and without limits but at the end of the 48 months i would own the hybrid where you would be giving this fiat back at least with the hybrid i could sellpart ex it an get some of my money back so this scheme is not for me
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,interesting insight it would be interesting to see how much you spend on coffee that you only bought because you felt obliged to do something to fill the charging time
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,zero ev roadtrip video coming soon and i only bought fooddrink i genuinely needed
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,turn the engine on tut tut mr hubnut there isnt an engine
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i am going to miss the days when all that was needed was a fuel gauge brake regeneration the outside temperature how hot the heater is really to compare the fiat 500 to a mobile phone just summed everything up for me im not a hater or electric cars i just love everything about the combustion alternatives thanks for confirming this for me
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,cornishhhme too if i decide its safe to straight line a corner i dont want the car to stop me maybe it can be switched off in the abarth 500
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,fascinated by electric cars so keep them coming i reckon have had my sons volvo xc40 recharge twin for 10 days while he was on a bush walk yummy üòÜ
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,just a note headlights being halogen or led doesnt make any measurable difference of course it doesnt hurt either in the real world for range of evs in anything but city driving its a common misconception they do though but its easily disproven in you think about power consuption of headlights vs how much it takes to push the car forward best case scenario the leds save you 70 watts so about 1kwh for 15 hours driving unless my brain is fried from todays long shift thats quite a bit less than 1 in most conditions or entirely within the margin of error cheers
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,do elec cars brake lights come on when using the re gen or do we run up the back of them cheers a j speed
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,while i would never own an ev i think this is an interesting service if you could use it for just a month it might be a fun way to experience an ev without having to own one i drive a hybrid as a daily and while i dont really like it it is actually a good car
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,onepedal driving is for me the biggest attraction of electric drive for reasons ive recently been driving a toyota porte jdm yaris based and having to use mechanical brakes to slow down seems unspeakably primitivesuch a waste of energy and wear on consumable parts i used to fly gliders and driving electrically reminds me of thatsmooth silent go with the vehicle doubtless not much fun on a track day but definitely the future and good to remember that electric is the real heritage motoring as there were good evs before ice was convenient
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,my car does one pedal driving its a 62l v8 petrol the engine has massive deceleration on the overrun you barely need the brakes its great you should try one
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,wibblywobbly1234 i am 78 and have no kids so climate change is of no personal interest to me but i think it would be nice to help you lot who will have to deal with it
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,michaelwright2986 you are the carbon they want to eliminate
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,wibblywobbly1234 i really think you should try to understand why the mention of electric vehicles inspires such rage and hatred in you of course we dont have to give up ice if energy companies can succeed in making synthesised hydrocarbons which are also the only plausible solution for aviation perhaps if you devoted your energies to getting the oil companies really working on that every body would be better off
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,michaelwright2986 synthetic aviation fuel manufactured from hydrogen and atmospheric co2 is possible but currently twice the price as fossil fuel that will change in time
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,mbak7801 only twice the price given the fluctuations in oil price and the externalised costs of fossil fuels thats pretty encouraging even at that price it could keep an original lotus elite viable though maybe not a 63 l v8or alas a big six aussie
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,the shortest road journey from our home in sussex to charing cross is a mere 49 miles the mobile phone signal at home is nonexistent not just a bit patchy nonexistent no mobile data at all there are no street lights and most houses in the village centre where we live have no parking at all there are 1500 residents not a single public charging point my 6 year old vw polos trade value has increased by at least 2000 in the last 2 years something tells me that although the corporate vampires want us to conform it will be decades before the infrastructure and pricing make ev cars affordable for all and even then it still should be a choice right anyway i love your channel and i love what you do always interesting thoughtful and deft turn of phrase thank you ian miss h you always brighten every day and no need to drive around looking for a charging point üòé
2023-09-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,sussex is letting the side down is there anywhere that you can complain range rover friendly no doubt but not friendly for evs not good
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,had my tesla model 3 since august i have always had family based cars almost always petrol but decided to spoil myself and buy the tesla i cannot ever see me going back to a ice car i love everything about it as i have off street parking and had a charger installed at my home i have never used public charging except the free pod points at tesco when they were free and i was getting my shopping and a bit of breakfast i also used it on a break in the cotswolds on arrival at the hotel found it had free to used tesla destination chargers so woke up every morning to a full tank for our day of touring around the area on our return journey went from not far outside gloucester to blenheim palace and return to port talbot without the need for an additional charge it is a real treat to wake up in the morning and head for work with seats and steering wheel nice and warm or cool in the summer very odd to not have a servicing schedule and any software updates received over the air overnight
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i like the sherpa mode im sure thats fiats tribute to the electric freight rover sherpa van of the 1980s there really was one i would love an electric sherpa van but as far as i know theres only one left in ipswich transport museum i believe the museum keeps it in working order so perhaps a hubnut test drive might not be out of the question
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i enjoyed that i have been lucky enough this year to be able to own a 2021 kia after 30 years of buying sub3k cars and im staggered at the difference in quality the supply chain of components to the auto industry has improved markedly in the last few years difficult to buy a bad car now and thankfully those days are behind us i fully embrace new stuff now and never thought i would i could see that you both appreciated this about the fiat of course i still love watching your spannering capers whilst also enjoying this touch of modern stuff keep it coming üòä
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,to some extent the demand for batteries etc will probably exceed most supply therefore is it better rather than govt 15 year car scrappage proposed one should look at vehicles that are going to be used more each day such as delivery vehicles rather than the school run otherwise that is a lot of lithium just standing around each day
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,querying why the doors need to be opened electronically what is the benefit its ironic that climate controll uses as much energy for heat as it does for cooling seeing that there is no engine to heat the air i think that you need a home charger if you are to have an ev permanent ally i think all cafes near charging points will do well
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i too like internal combustion engines but am not against electric vehicles they make a lot of sense in the way that they start with things going round and round instead of up and down full torque form zero like a steam engine quiet and refined early horseless carriages were powered by electric motors but even then as now the batteries are the problem and ices still have the advantage there is no real environmental or cost advantage air pollution just gets moved to somewhere else and by the time the manufacturing harm is recovered the batteries will be tired and need changing for new ones they should be seen as an alternative and not a replacement we should have choice and not a government diktat
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,awesome video as an ex truck driver i never look out the rear window i just use the side mirrors
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,an interesting and thought provoking watch i dont consider myself strongly pro or antiev i can see pros and cons to both sides of the debate in my own case the almost total lack of charging facilities and some grave concerns about methods reportedly used to obtain raw materials in parts if africa but thats a separate debate all by itself stop electric vehicles being a practical proposition at present i would also prefer a car thats more straightforward to operate as i find things like menu screens etc distracting and a lot of what they display is info i dont really feel i need i shall be watching future developments with interest though
2023-09-11,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,most evs dont use the raw materials in parts of africabut all fuel is desulpherised by such raw materials if you really had grave concerns youd change but do you really or just want to throw stones
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,the autoon lane keep assist on the ev mii i had used to annoy the bejesus out of me you could with an obd2 dongle make it remember you turned it off but i think the autoon thing is part of the insurance rating so beware
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,seems the ideal car for miss hubnut just download some engine sounds and ya good to go great review i could see you guys in an ami the new ones
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,cant wait till you take it apart when it goes wrong hubnut style only joking but it would be fun good vid on the ev i would love one but the range somewhat puts me off
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,unknown scares people and i have no problem admitting that evs scare me immensely also i dont think ill ever get over the range anxiety and 40 minutes of usable charging times not that i can afford any ev as of now but i cant see myself in one thanks for the review guys you are the best
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,a thoroughly marvelous roadtest and a superb insight into ev life looking forward to the the cable situation video also good times
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,this is a real test just daily use from a to b the time of year now also gives a good impression of the consumption of the kw in poorer conditions im curious to see the overview in a few months or how long you have had this 500e
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,its an utter pain in the arse im all for safety but this is stupid
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,hubnut i worry that if youre driving so tired that lane departure is a real possibility then you really shouldnt be driving at all
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,just ignore the haters i think this is a very interesting complement to the regular hubnutfleet and besides i may be a total renaultofthepatricklequementeranerd but that does not stop me from fiding the majority of cars interesting in one way or another even ugly ones or the ones i would never buy are interesting to know more about about evs totally agree on the adictive nature of regen and onepedaldriving absolutely love that i also like the opposite i had the chance to testdrive a mercedes eqs love it even if it represent a type of car i normally dont care for and while driving on the motorway with no regen i lifed off and let the car coast its slippery aerodynamic body made it stay at the same speed with no tedencies to slow down it just kept on gliding through the air effortlessly an amazing sensation also i agree on the horrors of lane departure warning systems i hate them have driven a volvo xc60 did not like any aspect of it and a tesla model y better than the volvo but still nope where the system kept on calling my attention like a neurotic backseat driver enfuriating especially the volvo since i was driving on very similar countryside roads as you drive on and the warning system was working overtime eww
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,one of my grips with evs iswas their tendency to reinvent every element of a car for no reason other than to appear futuristic however now the technology is maturing manufacturers are starting to make their evs a bit more conventional which appeals i think this fiat and the peugeot e208 are examples of this
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,yes there was a tendency to make evs look a bit out there initially
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,completely agree and that didnt help the ev cause because everything electric or even hybrid tried to look futuristic but usually ended up looking lame and aged badly
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,the over use of touch screen and undersupply of buttons annoys me but its a trend on ice vehicles too
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i do like the one pedal driving idea because a lot of the time i drive my petrol manual car like that only using the brakes when completely necessary and adjusting my speed with the throttle and gears means that i always have my eyes the road which is no bad thing and better than these folk having an affair with brake pedals i dont care what powers a car although environmental considerations are a priority but as long as i can drive then it can run on peanut butter for all i care
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,in the last 5 years seven yes seven housing estates have gone up bringing a huge influx of new cars there are 2 functioning public chargers there were a few others behind a council building then they put a covid testing centre there and within its perimeter fencing so they were inaccessible for that period now to cut costs the building is up for sale and the chargers are no longer connected to the grid until there is a proper commitment to the infrastructure they can urge us all and put as many ulez areas in as they want to but its not practical in the projected timescale
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,the wireless pad with key icon is probably the location to place the car key if its internal battery is flat assuming it has a remote key
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,glad you enjoyed it ian but its still not for me the environmental concerns are major downsides for me and the lack of charging infrastructure coupled with mileage anxiety would make it a scary experience thanks for sharing your real world experience of living with an ev and not in a city
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,ive done 85k rural ev miles the range thing you quickly learn to not be bothered about you charge at home 999 of the time anyway
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,you charge at home if you can we cannot
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,hubnut if you were committing yourself to ev ownership and couldnt charge at home youd really need a good number of loweffort choices for public charging or you might find yourself in a hole personally id find going off somewhere special to charge every day would be unworkable plus theres the cost with public chargers paying vat at the full 20 vs maybe an off peak tariff at home of course electricity prices are away in lala land right now
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i always had a whine at all speeds in the last three cars i owned strangely after my divorce the whine stopped
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,im not sure the charging built in to the cost is worth it if you have off road parking you really need a home charger because then the car is simply charged and ready for the journey in the morning you also need an economy 7 style cheap rate tariff then it becomes 1p to 2p a mile for me i still have a 5pkwh cheap rate at the moment but 7pkwh deals can still be found which is still under 2p per mile the problem really is when you dont have off road parking then you are at the mercy of the public charging network and that really is less convenient than petrol
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,902 if its anything like bmws and audis that little key icon will be where you put the key should the key battery be flat so you can still drive the car
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,489 a month or 5868 per year is a lot of money for most people it would be cheaper to run an older car than to build a new electric car and the effects on the environment in doing so with batteries only lasting 10 years its a waste of money sadly an affordable technology is not there yet hopefully in another 10 years things may be different
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,who says batteries only last 10 years new evs arent aimed at devotees to bangernomics theyre an alternative to a new ice car
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,grahamleiper1538 like the batteries found in electronic gadgets like smartphones and laptops electric car batteries degrade and become less effective over time this reduces the cars fullycharged electric range given enough time and repeated charging
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,gpsomg because car batteries dont have thermal management always charge to max and dont have massive redundancies built in these arent managed like phone batteries or laptop batteries tesla rate their batteries as designed for 500000 miles so 23 years
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,man i hate fiat and now with no engine
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i could be attracted to an ev but why oh why are they all designed by twelve year olds who think its really cool to load them with every pointless powersapping unreliable and irritating gadget ever dreamed up its like they were all designed by some tosser from microsoft whos got bored with updating windows every five minutes and turned his hand to car design im convinced that if someone came up with an electric equivalent of the 2cv or morris minor theyd make a mint windup windows yes please
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i like the idea of single pedal driving ive always thought that should be all you need on an electric vehicle perhaps a centre pivoted heel and toe pedal
2022-12-03,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,would be just my luck to jump back in an ice car and forget
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,electric cats are ok but unless for towing anything still far to long to recharge and the range lies more than boris
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,finally a non fanatic judging an electric car and it is what i expected it is for people with their own parking space with their own charging facility
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,neither are needed if you live in london if you have a subscription car from elmo there is a period of free electricity only a few months from a charge supplier they have around 4800 charge points across the country with around 4500 in london yes london as usual with 10 of the population gets over 90 of the resources it is seething with charge points so charging is no problem
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,its not a good sign of fiats own self confidence that there are almost no badges of theirs on the car anymore only on the bootlid theyre so sure that the 500 on its own matters more than their entire brand history outside of it that theyd almost rather you didnt think about them directly
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,but see also cupra ds and any number of premium ranges of motor vehicles the 500 has become a brand in its own right
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,cool little car great review however what we really need to know iswhat did you settle on for lunch üòÖ
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i never thought id live to see the day when hunbut of all people would start to complain about his car lacking some modern frivolity such as a bloody heated steering wheel this is almost sacrilege kinda like seeing the late great fred dibbnah forsaking his flat cap for a tiara
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,do not forget electric cars are powered by lithium ion batteries which contain cobalt 60 of which is mined in the democratic republic of congo it is estimated that 40000 of these workers are children who are small enough to crawl along the narrow shafts and have to remove the cobalt with their bare hands
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,there is a reason why cobalt is being phased out of ev batteries thats it but dont forget it isnt just evs that use lithium ion batteries
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,dont forget your car uses 10000 kg of crude oil on its lifetime which is not recyclable lithium and cobalt is and its only 2 kg lithium is open cast mine not underground coal mining
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,jusb1066 your car uses 10000 kg of crude oil source please
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,jusb1066 with all due respect to the legendary christopher hitchens that which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,johnnyquattro well ask yourself how long does a car engine last how much petrol does it burn in its lifetime and then do the math that is the answer for you are you an adult who can add
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,good test honest and experiencing what many face with battery cars the issues with charge points you can imagine being the same in all rural areas its good to see you enjoying creature comforts of a new car there is a place but as an option not a replacement to petrol and diesel
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,question 1 pedal driving when do the brake lights light
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,cant speak for the fiat but on a zoe the brake lights come on when youre getting regenerative braking similar to what youd get by lightly pressing the brakes otoh the zoe wont come to a complete halt on regen braking
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,light regen doesnt seem to trigger them only when it gets stronger so like easing off in a conventional car versus actually braking
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,so what do you do while you wait to charge
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,on ev all cars were new at one time and evs were around at the beginning like stanley steamers etc like ian i like them for how they drive part of what makes driving a joy is the wide variety of choices ev fiat one day independence chevelle the next in the us recharge is highly dependent on where you live gasoline electric hybrids are the best option for not getting stranded most importantly there seems no escape from the triangle of doom
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i love you channel evs and fiat 500s
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i was thinking not typing it all looks complicated and faffy then i remembered we own a 2018 carwifes daily thats really complicated and faffy luckily i also have a 20 year old van which is simple and squishy my daily thanks for the review its a good insight also it looks like a lovely car peace and love
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,is the charger infrastructure any better i remember you jaguar epace trip
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,that engine bay looks like it was designed for a petrol engine to me
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,this is what electric cars should be like physics and the paranoia for range have lead to a whole lot of oversized evs small evs make the most sense to me i am also not a fan of silly looking evs either why should you have to look likely a gumby to drive an ev
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,a lovely little car ian it would baffle me with all its technology but very nice
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,totally freaked that the rod stewart song the radio started playing 439 is the one my partner was listening to at the same time they were just a few seconds off sync back to the rest of the video
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,does the one pedal driving apply the brake lights when slowing
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i love my electric car and have now owned two vw id3 models first one is now in west wales and my current one sports a cx plate as i bought it in wrexham the problem with electric cars is the woeful charging network good luck finding a working fast charger when travelling away from home regarding ride the 58kw id3 is fantastic my long range 77kw model not nearly as good the bmw i3 which we run at work has a terrible choppy ride and is best avoided as regards the seamless power from a standing start it is such a revelation the anti electric car brigade i guarantee have never driven one
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,ive just covered 340 miles in two days and not one faulty charger did get charger blocked once though
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,great review as always ian co but all a lot of faffing about messing around with cables every night in the winter when you get home after 13 hours at workrange anxiety waiting for charging pointsspiralling electricity costs lot better off with a few grands worth off proper fiat 500 or panda 12 fire engine dead easy to servicenot contest for me
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i literally pull into my driveway pick up the charger wand on the wall and plug it in it takes less than 10 seconds wake up every morning with my car 80 full a range of 200 miles and it heats itself up for me before i leave my sofa
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,davidp7414 couldnt do the nc500 like ive done 1664 miles with a milk float mate dont care what anyone says
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,great video excellent review of the future i am also impressed how youve managed to spawn your own police force of contributors who launch preemptive strikes against anyone who is going to say anything negative about evs just to annoy goad that crew ill say this in the spirit of summing up what i think evs are great as a concept and in practice for many motorists they are likely to be the way to get about independently in the future in reality its another step in the direction of cars becoming sterile containers charging is not great on the public network and is now the equivalent of 130 a litre on my local council network so they are not going to be marketed as cheap to either buy or even to run the idea of considering how to dress while in the car because you dont want to put the heating on is frankly bonkers i regard wearing a coat and thick socks while driving as a bit odd if they charged much more quickly 10 mins from min to max and there were a lot more charge points i dont think there would be anywhere near as much negativity its the future and will be the way to get about but an ev is not something we will be likely to take out for a run to soak up the atmosphere i think thats what upsets some its the end of motoring as a fun thing with character
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,thing is ill never stop loving my character cars but i love the experience of driving electric
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,hubnut agreed although how much of the ev thing is novelty toy value time will only tell i think as a means of getting about id pick an ev 99 times out of 100 they are so easy to drive and they have a smugfaceinducing quality about them must ignore the alleged fun of planning how to loiter in a supermarket to get some extra charge in but to go for a drive in an ev it would be like going on holiday in a utility room once youve exhausted the thrill of repeating the fastest ever 040mph
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,johnlladron735 a bit facetious of me perhaps but have you ever driven a modern econobox not much to be excited about in them either if you ask me the drivetrain being ev doesnt make much difference in that case seems to me its rather the modern car part rather than the ev drivetrain thats the culprit of them having no personality
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,goldencroc i agree with you most cars ceased to have personality pretty much 20 years ago i think that evs have just sealed the deal on sterility however please consider what i said about which car id choose for most journeys driving is pretty crap these days and you just want the least hassle in the cheapest operational manner evs do that even better than an econobox there is clear water between fun and modern motoring just wish the ev charged a lot faster because that is rather rubbish
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,johnlladron735 well i am in the lucky spot of sitting pretty with my dream car for fun trips already bought yes really my dream might be a bit unusual dont forsee me selling it ever if i want even more adrenaline i get one of the sportsbikes out of the garage if i wanted an ev commuter i would buy something like an old nissan leaf personally disclaimer this whole post was a bit of a sidenote and not really a reply to anything specific you wrote cheers
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i dont like electric cars
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,nice review ian its nice to see a petrol head that likes evs as i am the same ive a tesla model 3 lr its the best car ive owned bar none apart fromthe model 3 it replaced its an awd 400 bhp 5 seat sport saloon and has realworld range of 300 miles on the motorway for there is nothing like them on the road its done 400 miles today at an average speed of 59 mph at the grand cost of 1460 i charged for 14 minutes the amount of time it took to go to the services restroom and grab a coffee hardly an inconvenience
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i have the model 3 sr and i regularly get 250 miles and its interesting that it appears better on the motorway than in towncountry roads ive done 25000 miles since march and as a result will never go back to a vehicle directly powered by fossil fuel though i dont think our governments removal of all assistance in purchasing an ev is a serious impediment to their wider adoption
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,tesla is a good looking car but can you tell me do the brake lights come on when the throttle is lifted and it slows rather quickly i only ask as one overtook me pulled in front and slowed because of traffic i very nearly ran into the back of it
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,eng9040 yes brake lights come on when slowing down on regen to clarify brake lights dont come on when very gently slowing down with regen much like using engine braking on a manual ice car does not put the brake lights on
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,and it charges in 20 minutes on the supercharger and tells you if there are chargers available before you arrive y owner
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,phonotd depends when you buy if i bought my car today with options it would be 65k mine was 49k
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,garethsaunders1260 and there you have it i couldnt justify 49k never mind the 65k price tag my current vehicle was purchased new 1 year ago for around 28k if i had gone down the hybrid route it would have cost me around another 5k but the maths didnt add up to that being a sensible option and it certainly wouldnt have been any greener
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,davidp7414 where exactly and how plentiful are these super chargers surely common physics dictates that rapid charging of batteries also reduces their service life
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,357 its amazing how you do that female voice i never saw your lips move what a talent
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,theodore roosevelt drove an electric car made by columbia vehicles of connecticut on the 22nd of august 1902 more than 120 years ago wowabout them onions
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,sherpa mode makes it sound like it should transform ala insperctor gadgets car into a leyland sherpa not sure how thatd be an advantage though p
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,did you sort the traction battery alert in the end
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,fiat came from making the most trashy rubbishy cars in the 70s to now producing some of the best cars on the road the fiat 500 is a success because it looks good compared to its sister model ford which didnt sell very well at all because it didnt have the looks also i think the petrol engine has got so complicated and in the attempt to make it environmentally friendly thats gone beyond its usefulness where as the petrol engine will always have a place in history we can all be proud of but the electric is the future
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i found the interior of the old 500 too narrow theres no elbow room next to the door i expected this to be better but its not
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i own 3 cars with a combined age of 106 years 2 that suit the daily needs of my family and a third for limited use fun if i am forced to replace my station wagon with an electric vehicle what are my choices and how long will it last
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,actually really interesting to hear your experiences out in the wilds as although not relevant 99 of the time to 99 of the people being on holiday in a place like ceredigion for 1 of our time and what happens with charging is a large part of many peoples anxieties about buying an ev
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,aberystwyth finally has quite a few chargers about time further south is still a proper challenge though
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,ive never had an issue finding charging for my 500e no one should be put off buying an ev as most people do no more than 20 miles a day and home charging should see to that easily
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,my town in ireland has many public car parks and roadside parking bays have them along with two local supermarket car parks they are provided by the electricity supply network company esb debit or credit card payment own cables required and most are 75 kwh a few rapid charge but increasing in numbers slowly
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,look folks were all just going to have to get used to electric cars one day so suck it up buttercup üòä
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,ill have to watch this just to give it a fair try i have to say though ive never ever liked the 500 such an ugly awkward looking car to me i always preferred the panda hahaha
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,agree stephen and i wonder if the muck on the fiat was caused by a covert test drive by matt at furious driving
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,does the lack of really using the brakes as much have a noticable effect or is it hilly enough for you not to notice a difference
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,it stops strongly using regen i barely touch the brake pedal though the car will brake for you in one pedal mode
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,hubnut remember you need to use the brake pedal sometimes to stop the calipers from seizing if not used
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,the car operates the brakes itself and even hill holds im sure the calipers will be fine
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i really like the fiat 500 but the lack of rear doors makes me want to wait for the fiat panda which hopefully comes out fairly soon
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,another great review ian nice to see you have the occasional foray into new vehicles puts the older ones into context nicely i have a very new car and two much older cars the best combo imho 500 looks like the perfect second car for local mileage
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,please dont make your reviews about whats in the touch screen like doug demuros done
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,splendid review üôÇ
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i never realised the cost to charge it was included with onto have to say i really like the inside of the 500 reminds me of fiats of old especially those little touches of the map of turin and the old 500 a excellent and balanced review of what you like and do not like
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,its not a family car but its a great city car i am very much looking forward to the abarth
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,as long as the abarth doesnt have artificial pops and bangs from a pretend exhaust waking everyone up every morning then thats ok that would be an immense improvement over the petrol
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,mattbrownbill it does have a pretend engine note but no pops and bangs and you can switch it off and drive in silence
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,one of the things that makes me against silly priced electric cars is the fact they are being rammed down our throats by over paid politicians who can afford themat our expense üò° in the name of saving the planetwhich we know is all bull shittery
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,do the brake lights come on with regen
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,they do depending on the strength it also applies the hydraulic brakes in one pedal mode
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,there is definitely a place for evs very good for puttering around when you dont have to go far and dont care much about engines etc
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,ive done 25000 miles since march in an ev and i can testify that they are for more than just puttering around
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,most peoples requirements fit well within the range of a modern ev 90 of the time people are always thinking they need 600 miles because thats what they get out of a tank of diesel but thats like wearing a waterproof goose down parka in may through july because you were cold and wet for 3 days in january you just adjust your thinking the charging time is a negative but there are positives to make up for it you shouldnt be doing over 200 miles without a rest anyway really so as long as there are enough chargers about for people to use taking a 1540 minute break every 3 and a bit hours might make the roads safer highway code says 15 minutes every 2 hours of driving the furthest you could go in 2 hours is about 130 ish miles so well under an evs range
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,leatherworkstation agreed evs are probably fine most of the time apart from the cost its the other 10 that is the problem if there was no push to get rid of ice vehicles but to coexist there wouldnt be such a back lash im sure most people would be happy to use an ev if affordable most of the time but if you want to tow something occasionally and for a myriad of other reasons occasionally use an ice vehicle it shouldnt be a mortal sin if it is i suggest we give up jet travel and use electric trains and clipper ships
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,chrisyoung7157 you have summed it up perfectly there is a backlash because people cant afford to buy a new car and are worried about what is going to happen in 2030
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,dave marshall thats on them though isnt it noone has ever said that ice cars in general are going away in 2030 of course they arent theyre just not making new ones if you cant afford a new electric car you cant afford a new petrol car theyre not that far apart and its in the news currently that by 2025 evs are expected to be cheaper to purchase than an ice if you dont like electric cars you dont like new cars most likely so what does it matter if they stop making new ice ones youre not going to get one anyway because apart from the engine all modern cars have the same issues that subscribers to this channel dont like also all my life people have being telling me that were eventually going to run out of oil it hasnt happened yet and may not happen ever but that has been a constant background throughout my life youd think everyone would be prepared by now to prepare for other means of propulsion
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,my old renault scenic 06 did that if i was stopped at lights it would shut off the wipers and go again once driving but there was also a knob to change how sensitive the sensor was
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,my every day car among others i own is 29 years old but its good to review these cars as fuel is not going to get cheaper
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,probably a perceived market demand and manual reversion for emergency purposes does seem odd as it all adds weight
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,really interesting and useful review thanks for doing it
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,nope it cycles the various settings intermittent full on max speed
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,does sherpa mode give you the feel of driving a 1970s leyland van
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,very interesting i too like the styling but i dont like that you have to manage the accessories to save power that is a turn off for me
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i like em the charger availability thing reminds me of the early days of cashpoints where can you find ome and is it compatible very familiar the sooner every lamp post is upgraded with a socket the better really years ago i joked that evs might give birth to a market of downloadable car tones so you can give it engine noises of your choice
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,absolutely brilliant video ian miss hubnut it really is a lovely car brilliantly filmed guys
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,good stuff lots of info i love the technology but still not sure i would want an ev yet
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,what a couple of stars given car to review by company goes christmas shopping you two are the best big thumbs up for the review as always
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,that nice little space should be a wireless phone charger it is in ours
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,im also of a similar mindset where i like evs a lot as well as classics i just recently found out that fiat will retail the 500e in 2024 i would love one now
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,we had one of the first primas in the country owned it for about 18 months my wife loves it i still have my 2017 passat dinosaur burner for work but in town this thing is my first choice over the vw weve done longer trips in it id say we get 120 miles on a run about 140 around town i get the naysayers but they are usually people that havent spent any real time with an ev it goes like stink from the lights im 6ft 2 and 20 stone and fit fine but the go pedal makes my foot ache because of he angle the electronics are not very good they are laggy and keep resetting to kms
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,jusb1066no they haventall the new cars and vans i drive have wipers with minds of there own and headlights witch switch on when going under a treeuseless technology for the sake of it
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i wish they could make this without any gizmos no power steering no ac with manual mirrorswindows etc i like buttons screens are never intuitive
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,they dont make any modern car like it
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,the timing does say it all they only show up to flood the comment section early so they feel like theyve conquered todays battlefield in the great imaginary war against evs the rest of us showed up to watch a video i guess
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,munkenba i could be wrong but i suspect the anti ev sentiment is generated by what people see as a war against ice vehicles if they were left to compete on merit i think there would be no war current narrative is to demonise ice vehicles those who cant afford an ev or just dont see it fitting into their mission requirements understandably get annoyed love an ev myself but dont want it forced on me id like both
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,id only have confidence in owning an electric car if there are many more chargers and super fast ones too
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i think the main issue with electric cars is theres always going to be a shortage of charges because of the sheer amount of time you are connected to one of course you can fill up 20 cars with petrol in the same time
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,jusb1066 come visit germany and see how charging may look in 3 years in the uk thats the time it took us to get from a single 50 kw charger here and there to at least 4 300 kw chargers in most service stations and 2030 up to over 100 at highly frequented places thats not including tesla superchargers
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,germany is running out of energy what do you think is going to power all those chargers
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,jusb1066 germany has an even worse energy situation than the uk solar doesnt produce much power in winter and needs 100 backup the natural gas situation is a disaster german companies are shuttering and offshoring due to the cost of electricity politicians have made very shortsighted decisions and the consequences are now being felt
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,wibblywobbly1234 everywhere was relying on russian gas exactly why we should have gone to renewables many years ago certainly not a reason to be clinging on to them electricity maybe short but it exists cant say the same for relying on other countries
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,jusb1066 uk was 3 russian gas germany was 60 there is no replacement ready at any price renewables make the electricity grid unstable above around 20 of supply germany should have invested in nuclear 20 years ago foolish decisions made now you are completely screwed shortages and blackouts coming wake up
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,btw are you aware that the production of 6 litres of fuel already needs about 810 kwh of electricity which alone will bring an electric car over 50 km even before the electric equivalent of these 6 litres is being used so if you are asking for the least energy consumption you sure as hell want to go evs
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,garage6346 the german government has just announced a 200b energy subsidy for german consumers and businesses the bill will have to be paid somehow the uk is not much better marginal electricity cost is touching 1200 per mwh insanity in all directions the problem could be solved by dropping the trade embargo with russia and cancelling the push for net zero unfortunately politicians would rather see us freeze and starve than admit they were wrong
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,garage6346 1kwh of electricity takes an ev about 3miles 5km
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,wibblywobbly1234 now you are talking about prices a shortage would have been something like the uk had a while ago that affected fuel btw not electricity if i may remind you regarding ev mileage my ioniq consumes about 17 kwh100 km in winter at german autobahn speeds 14 in summer and under 12 with everyday b road usage my wifes e208 and my fathers id3 are about 2 kwh100 km higher but yes of course theres bella vs betty in the ev world too
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,garage6346 theres never a shortage in a free market politicians are not allowing the free market to operate they are deciding which fuels we should use they are fixing prices and they are using subsidies the inevitable outcome will be shortages
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i dont understand the hate people have for electric cars hubnut is about various things but one of the most important as jayemm once testified is being open to different views and tastes and another is ians delivery which we all enjoy otherwise we wouldnt watch hubnut if he were to talk about sewing machines in a video id watch it because this is hubnut and i suspect many would too but an actual car just with a different means of propulsion and some petrolheads are getting their knickers in a twist grow up
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,its the buying price and range i dont like and also no use to those of us living in flats
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,we cant charge at home either it isnt the end of the world though it would be more convenient to be able to
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,same could be said about some ev detractorsnot aiming that at you but some haters hate far too much
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i am grown up no issue with evs only the hazardous safety and environmental battery technology employed its going to be diesel gate 2 and worse in 15 years time when there is no commercial market for lithium or cobalt millions of these batteries are being produced and no end of life statutory requirement on the manufacturer to take responsibility its an absolute ticking environmental time bomb and an inconvenient truth go research it yourself rather than take my word
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,the hate is justified until car companies start making affordable evs with the equivalent range of an ice
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,tylerhornby2619 do you know what else was expensive and compromised when they were relatively new petrol cars
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,part of the problem is that there isnt enough lithium known on the planet to replace ice vehicles for gb alone let alone the world forget all the other places lithium batteries are needed phones renewables back up then there is the problem of zero resale value when the battery starts failing then the fact the batteries cant be recycled and will go into landfill to leach out many many more problems just scratching the surface i love hubnuts videos no matter what car but we can give our opinions nonetheless
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,fugawiaus and at the end you will have to pay to get it taken away for scrapping not good for those of us who drive yokes nearing the end of their lives cos it is all we can afford üò≠
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,tom mullins modern evs are about 12 years old the main battery chemistry has already changed numerous times and will continue to do so so there may be less material issues in the future a lot of your post about values etc seems to be based on the incorrect belief that batteries in evs fail quickly they dont first gen nissan leafs are still driving about on their og battery and they didnt even have active cooling to protect the battery modern battery management looks after them much better and theyll last for donkeys years definitely well over 100k miles there are teslas over 300000miles and nissan say their batteries will last 500k before failing and any battery issues arent normally total replacement jobs the batteries are made up of individual cells so you can replace the ones that are reporting issues for much less by 100k miles plus1015 years in what value are you expecting to have in the car if ive got a 14 year old petrol suv and a 14 year old ev suv both bought for around 40k im going to accept that im not going to get my money back
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,hubnut i think the hate comes from the fear ice cars will become illegal if they were allowed to continue to compete with evs i suspect the hate would evaporate
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,way too expensive for what it is too many compromises ok as a second or third car but thats all
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,richard howlett average weekly mileage in the uk is 142 miles a week most people could run one happily with one charge every 710 days at a rapid charger price is predicted to be cheaper than ice by 2025 apparently too though that is the major issue as it stands
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,leatherworkstation a couple of weeks ago i was at the classic car show at the nec i live in bury i drove there and back without any concern summer 2021 i drove to an event in the new forest and returned that day one of my favourite places to visit is the mull of galloway do i need to go on
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,richard howlett nothing stopping you doing that in an ev you might not even have to stop and charge depending on which one youve got only place i know in bury is gigg lane so i did gigg lane to the nec and its 109 miles planning a 20 minute stop to top up your battery isnt concerning to me i dont know why it would be to anyone sure its not a fantastic thing and by no means a benefit of ev ownership but its not concerning
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,leatherworkstation mate you can change the chemistry and get slight changes in current battery tech till the cows come home your changing 140 miles to 145 miles it doesnt change the fact there isnt enough lithium known to supply the volumes the batteries cost 3x the cost of manufacture to recycle so they go to landfill to leach into the water table most of the parts on the ev are composite to keep down weight and arent recyclable it costs 10000 to 30000 to replace a battery in an ev meaning it has zero resale value there are cars still being used at over 120yrs old they are classics and have style form and function evs are generic and at times difficult to tell apart they will not be kept they are purely function nobodys interested buying a second hand car knowing they will have to spend tens of thousands of dollars on it its disposable look at your toasters tvs etc they used to last then you got it repaired now they are disposable you dont get them fixed this is the direction of evs the batteries are made in china good luck a vast amount have been replaced under warranty more have failed waaaay early that 30000 price tag isnt for replacing cells because its cheaper to replace the whole pack than strip it down to replace individual parts they wont be repaired they are disposable you dont get your phone battery repaired you toss the phone at the end of the day these only make sense as a small inner city runabout for mum as the family second car outside that they are useless ps those old evs rare as hens teeth
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,alexander most of the hate is from being trounced at the traffic light grand prix by even the most mundane of evs the price point not being part of the club and then youll get made up nonsense about issues the person never before had an interest in that they half remembered from a daily mail article thats part based in fact from 2016 but mostly just lies theres plenty of examples above of pure nonsense but it mainly comes down to the price of admission what do children do when they cant have something well anyone who is a parent knows theres plenty of valid criticism of evs most of which applies in spades to ice and that which doesnt well that tends to be brand and infrastructure specific 31 years of ice ownership classic and modern and counting for me coming to an end as soon as oh and the battery wall we have repurposed ex ev pack the only thing that needs to go to landfill is the bs people come up with about something they are envious of
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,davidspencer7254 you might have a point about being excluded from the club because of the price however i think its worse than that because the narrative is not only you wont be allowed in the club eventually we will take your ice vehicle off you or tax it out of existence leaving you nowhere unless we are prepared to give up airline travel i think we should stop treating ice vehicles and their owners as expendable i suggest they be allowed to coexist and if evs become clearly superior thats what people will buy
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,davidspencer7254 most evs dont go blowing anybody away at the lights most are in the 610 sec0100 the others cant afford to do that often range anxiety of course 100 is about it for an ev my v8 keeps pulling to its speed limited 265kph meanwhile that sound oh and i can actually load my car and tow something evs not so much but everything you wrote is explained in your last paragraph the salesmen saw you coming from a mile off when an ev battery is dead or dying it cant be reused the chemical reaction has stopped ceased it cannot be reused you cant take a dead battery and put it in your house its still dead theres a sucker born every minute
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,fugawiaus yes of course you will be driving at 100mph at the lights silly boy if you cant afford a fast ev you cant afford a fast ice i quote fast because well lets face it they arent fast are they not in reality a few outliers are fast but the bell curve of ice vehicles are way slower than the bell curve of evs as for range anxiety it would take a vast amount of blasting off your v8 tractor to turn that into range anxiety you seem stuck in the 20132018 nissan leaf era with your comments everything is explained by your last paragraph an ev battery is not just one battery its a vast array of cells with a bms when its not fit for cycling in an ev due to the number of dead or dying cells going below a certain soh its perfectly usable for a home battery please do at least the minimum of research before posting unless you want to look ignorant in which case mission achieved
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,fugawiaus there isnt enough lithium known on the planet where did you get this factoid lithium is a very common element then there is the problem of zero resale value when the battery starts failing define starts failing do you mean battery capacity then the fact the batteries cant be recycled they can be recycled a nissan leafs battery pack can be refurbished using 90odd percent of the original material youre talking bollocks
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,tylerhornby2619 define range on an ic on one tank how often do you drive brim to fumes whats your commute 20 miles re price does that mean you hate ferraris too and rolls royces what about gas and electricity ultimately any new car is expensive by hubnut standards but eventually grandpa hubnut will be travelling to the outer hebrides to collect a 300 electric fiat 500 that will breakdown somewhere around glasgow
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,chrisyoung7157 isnt that a self fulfilling prophecy though if the majority of people move to evs then theres no need to force people off ics i can still drive my traction engine on the highway although that would probably change if everyone did that
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,benholroyd5221 the intention of many governments to ban the sale of new ice vehicles in 2030 suggests there is every intention to force people off them i think much of the angst would go away if people were allowed to buy what suits their requirements and or bank balance if evs are an acceptable price do what people require of them they wont need protection
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,davidspencer7254 i didnt say mph where i live you can you replace a battery because its dead or dying the chemical reaction will cease the original battery is replaced because all the cells are almost used up they dont last forever they are on their last legs again there is a sucker born every minute ps im an electrician
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,chrisyoung7157 banning sales is different to making them illegal though if bank balance is an issue youve still got another decade plus of second hand cars i do share the concern somewhat but it depends how the market pans out but ultimately i dont think thats where the hate is coming from anyway
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,benholroyd5221 as you say time will tell i guess im pessimistic and evs will come up against some insurmountable problems that will disenfranchise half the population if the current thinking remains dont get me wrong id like an ev myself not exclusively tho current prices i wont be getting one and would be very reluctant to buy an old one when the batteries are prohibitively expensive to replace
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,tom mullins old evs are rare because they didnt sell many not because theyre broken once you take the ones that people binned into a tree or whatever there really shouldnt be a lot of imievs about for example i see plenty of gen 1 leafs on my travels though youve misunderstood my battery chemistry point though its not just about making the batteries go further thats not the drive for chemistry changes its material and weight new chemistries have already significantly reduced cobalt usage there are lithium free batteries being made that are comparable to lithium ones for static usage which can bring down overall lithium usage should evs not move away from it and really its new technology were living through it in the 90s any rechargeable battery was nicad noone thought anything of it it was just what you got if you wanted a rechargeable anything and then they just got replaced by something better that might happen with liion but we cant see into the future you need to take off your rose tinted spectacles i think all cars are generic especially modern ones and anything since i dont know the 90s there are a few that are special but then there are a few evs that are special too if youre not close minded badge engineering and focus groups killed most originality and quirkiness in motoring long before the ev came along
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,leatherworkstation im an electrician evs are definitely not the future cells have a life they can only hold a charge and be charged so many times chemistry 101 if one cell is failing then the others will fail soon as well except if one is faulty evs have been around since the early 1900s they failed back then no one wanted them they reappeared in the 50s and 60s again fail they have been tried and failed until recently governments threatening mandating them has forced them into the market the first nissan leafs were rubbish and not worth replacing the batteries the new ones arent much better as soon as something is forced on society it will inevitably end badly you cannot build billions of evs build massive battery farms to back up renewables build billions of disposable phones car batteries campingemergency batteries for the entire planet there is simply not enough lithium the whole climate rubbish is starting to crash and burn and it will take out the ev utopia with it
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,benholroyd5221 id love an electric dont get me wrong i could afford one but the amount of miles i do doesnt warrant the upfront cost but at work i do sometimes 300 miles a day i dont think thats possible without recharging
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,tom mullins climate rubbish starting to crash and burn as countries say no to fossil fuels en masse including china and invest in renewables dont know what reality you live in but it isnt the same as the rest of us you being an electrician isnt really relevant unless youre a battery technician and even then i wouldnt say knowledge of material mining and scarcity is relevant to battery production linemaintenance electricians im an aerospace engineer but ive not got a clue how much titanium or aluminium there is in the ground even if there isnt enough probably isnt on earth you dont need it for every battery you need it at the moment for cars but battery farms dont need it for a start sodium ion or bromide batteries are suitable for that as are various other old hat chemistries and things like that welsh water battery where they pump during the day and let it run through a generator at night you dont need lithium for a lot applications just light weight and portable ones
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,leatherworkstation talk about living in a delusion china has officially pulled out of all agreements on climate they are currently building about one coal plant per month india is building them philippines is building them the only renewables china makes is for export to idiots that dont understand how they workor dont work oh being an electrician is not relevant to batteries you are kidding arent you are you serious aerospace engineer do you even know how electricity works my son is also an electrician working in kalgoorlie in western australia he works with one of the largest mine specific electrical companies in the world keep getting your info from facebook and twitter your not qualified to talk on this subject
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,exellent but ian i aint rich enough cannot justify ev buying my most expensive car as im hub nut 4500 as 99 off time car is sitting outside house cannot justify spending a fortune on newish buy cheap drive around 5000 a year three cars at moment 3000 nissan qashqie 55000 miles 2010 first ones better than newer renault at least i spend more thsn my limit around my passing off driving test in 1984 was 500 at moment nissan streached me from my normal at present days 1500 per car money fore family not cars only ive only had three breakdowns since i passed my test in 1984 cars were hillman imp morris marina cortina mk3cavalir mk1datsun violet datsun 140jcarolla earky one renault 25 nissan bluebird x2 skoda esttle2x hyundi atoz granada mk3 etc exellent huuuubbbbnnnutttteeerrriiiissshhhhnnnneeesssssneil
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,tom mullins china dont like being told what to do thats why they dont sign up to international agreements but theyre using more renewables than they ever have 30 plus this year they just use coal for majority of the rest thats the issue in europe we use coal as the last resort i do know how electricity works yeah but my point was unless youre an electrician who is also a battery technician and a lithium scarcity and mining expert its not really relevant because others who are those things say differently people just put their occupation or training in to win arguments on the internet but well done for taking it in the worst way possible twitter is a cesspit and facebook is for old people so im alright thanks i normally search for scientific papers and reuters stuff
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,fugawiaus this comment is complete nonsense from beginning to endevery word there isnt even one tiny bit of actual truth contained herein youve completely embarrassed yourself with your mindless ignorant stupidity and thats being complementary and think on this in eight years time you wont be able to buy a new ice car in the uk so youd better get your brain around some actual facts or you could start catching the bus
2022-12-01,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,andymccabe6712 keep putting your fingers in your ears screaming lalala and burying your head in the sand your utopian idealism is just around the corner twitter and facebook say so
2022-12-01,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,dont like the word petrol head it makes me think of clarkson i have no problems with electric cars but for most in flats and street parking they are not economic to charge up 22 quid to charge a 60kwh car plus the charges for sitting in that space
2022-12-01,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,price range charging infrastructure apart from if battery powered cars are so good why does the government need to ban ice car manufacture in 2030 surely battery cars being so good everyone would want one so automatically making ice car not worth the while manufacturing
2022-12-01,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,torresalex except that the battery powered car is pretty much as old as the petrol car like no need to reinvent the wheel
2022-12-01,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,barriewilliams4526 battery are as old as petrol cars but you cannot compare one to other in terms of investment and development do you know what else had crap prices and infastructure when they started out petrol cars
2022-12-01,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,fugawiaus 95 of a lithium battery car phone aa button cells not cost effective atm but should still not be put in the bin can be recycled into new ones so are not thrown away especially as its a valuable commodity even the metal casings can get recycled as old pc boards are once they do reach 70 of original charge capacity they can be replaced leafs can even get upgraded to later model batteries subsidiary of nissan repurposes used batteries into domestic power wall sets
2022-12-02,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i totally agree both about hubnut and cars a car is a car and electric cars are no worse or better on average than petrol ones they do have some big plusses though if you care about the environment id still love to run a classic though
2022-12-02,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,chrisrichardson774 yes there are some hurdles that need to be sorted out price will get more attractive naturally with scale and technology we would have been looking at parity in prices around now if there hadnt been so much disruption in the world range is not an issue with newer cars though they are much more expensive and so your point on prices will stand for longer than if you only needed a short range car for your last point i reckon some serious legislation is required you would need your own dedicated parking space with charger but this sounds like more expense i dont live in london but i believe they have on street charging i dont know how it works but i cant imagine you can leave your car on a charger from the moment you get home until the next morning this would upset others wanting to use it i dont know what the answer is perhaps special council charge cards to get charged at a public charger at home rates this solves the cost but not the convenience chargers at the workplace could help i have friends who can charge at work for free im sure some clever people out there will come up with the answer lets hope so anyway
2022-12-02,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,royblackburn1163 you are right the truth is not hate but that doesnt mean that hate is the truth many people who are anti ev are being so from a point of ignorance and they keep rolling out the same old debunked myths there are plenty of reasons to be sceptical about evs but their cleanliness compared to ice cars and their validity as enjoyable cars are not among them it is when these false arguments are levelled against the ev that i sadly and ashamedly get angry
2022-12-03,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,fugawiaus the batteries are in many cases being repurposed to store electricity for the national grid not used for landfill and there are plenty of evs are still on their original batteries stop regurgitating nonsense propagated by the big oil companies in cahoots with msm
2022-12-03,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,briandamaged323 both the msm and fossil fuel are some of the largest investors in renewables you dont seem to know much did you get that rubbish from twitter or face book opinion pieces written by an unqualified reporter none of you have the simple understanding of how batteries work or how putting second hand batteries in with new ones will make the overall battery system unstable and ultimately bound for failure you never mix old batteries with new ones you shouldnt even do that in a torch with d cell batteries but of course you are all the experts twitter and facebook say so
2022-12-04,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,briandamaged323 no i got that off the prospectus and websites of the large renewables companies its called research you should learn it sometime rather than get your scientific knowledge from trusted science publications like facebook and twitter i maybe a dinosaur but at least im not a naive useful idiot
2022-12-09,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,electric cars are neither bad nor good they are simply hated when they are an imposition by authorities that prevent us from driving freely and choosing what type of car we want or can have
2022-12-09,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,carlosmartinezyq1gm slippery slope you let people drive what they want and they are selfish and irresponsible on the other hand impose what they can drive and you end up with trabants its a matter of balance the middle ground people should be sensible but many times are not
2022-12-11,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,royblackburn1163 you make some good points but also get some thing wrong your reasons for not going for an electric car yet are all valid that you have to charge them with dirty electricity is completely false i dont im on a clean tariff and have solar nuclear power i grudgingly admit that we probably need it like we need to mine for minerals to make our cars and like we need to devote resources to grow ourselves food lets look at each case and try and improve how we do things rather than throw in the towel and keep polluting ourselves to oblivion
2022-12-13,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,royblackburn1163 im not sure how renewables can be thought unreliable the sun seems to come up every day and the wind is always blowing somewhere i think i know what you mean though you cant produce solar during the night and occasionally the wind might drop even in the north sea this is where storage will come in we have a plan it isnt all in place yet but it can and will work im confident of it this problem that putin is causing is a temporary spanner in the works i can see some knee jerk reactions happening such as renewed calls for fracking but wish the powers that be could understand that if they spent the same money on renewables and the systems to make them work we could not only get these problems solved more quickly than any other method could but it would also be sustainable best regards tim
2022-12-13,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,royblackburn1163 i think your first point is answered or will be by storage you make a good point but i believe the answer is there we are totally in agreement on nuclear and fracking it seems i reckon youre doing your bit with the car and bike im an exbut itching to be again biker and so im bound to ask what bike you have i would love a zero or something similar but alas circumstances make it out of the question for the moment your landy sounds awesome you should not feel and it seems you dont guilt for keeping a classic i would argue against it being as green as an ev simply because you still have to burn fossil fuel to go anywhere but lovely old cars like this have a place as long as mass transport gets cleaner i hope we can justify keeping and running classics of course a mitsubishi evo just as an extreme example to make a point is a future classic perhaps biofuels can make these oldies even more guilt free i have heard that companies porsche for one are working on synthetic fuels so there may be other options i am optimistic for the future i can see a day when we can squander as much energy as we can think of ways of doing so and it will be sustainable this will give us the best of all worlds all the best tim
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i worked out i couldnt rely on itev in an urban area without a drive or home charging due to expense and hassle that was before tesco and i expect others soonstopped free chargingthe amount of phev and frikken teslas taking up free charging bays and other public ones was nuts and imo selfishi drive a petrol abarthwhich i love at the moment so was a prime customer for a 500e but instead have got a 2002 stepwgn with a honda k for some camping your hubnut camping vids may have influenced me a little üòÄ
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,its overpriced per month for that can someone explain why anyone would pay that monthly
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,because it includes insurancepublic charging and servicing cost and its not a finance deal its a subscription service so you can change to different cars and your not locked in like car finance if your financial situation changes
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,well call avis and compare the rates can anyone quote the all inclusive monthly cost of their own new car i doubt it if they did they would probably have a cardiac
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,jamescaley9942 ive got a 2021 focus st line x and my monthly cost of insurance tax and finance is 350 so cant get my head around paying nearly 600 a month for that thing on another note its limited on what charging stations you can use oh and i get 4 years servicing included not selling it to me
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,very good question its absolutely crazy money and on limited mileage i have no answer
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,started watching halogen on a modern electric car power wasting should be 100 led
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,those electric cars are waste incarnate everything is too heavy and theyre full of useless and heavy bells whistles
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,richierich1245 anything helps the light is so much brighter and the cost of the car this is a small but necessary addition plus halogen headlights seem so 1990s
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,datasilouk1995im finding most modern car lights too bright especially in the rain i thought there were limits for such things
2022-11-30,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,mattbrownbill yes i agree a couple of evenings a week i do a 20 mile journey on a switchback main road and am constantly dazzeled by vehicles wth these bright white head lamps as we meet on the dips and rises night time driving is no pleasure at all
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,just a friendly note nuova new in italian f is pronounced norva not nuover in italian ie norva fiat 500
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,retiredbore378 given that i come from an italian family have lived in italy and was not promulgating the actual phonetics of the word but approximating the actual pronunciation for a british english speaker using nor as in norwood and va as in van 1st syllable gets one much closer to a correct pronunciation than using a mutant bastardization of the spanish word for new nueva have a nice evening and please dont fall dont the stairs tonight after you trip on your own smugness üòòüòò
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,retiredbore378 not at all old boy i have a workout to complete this evening and little pep in my step does not hurt all i have long made peace that many older people are still alive because neither god nor the devil can stomach their arrival so put off the date to the very last minute
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,retired bore indeed even the alphabet can vary from the standard 21 letters
2022-11-29,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,howardlevert really please enlighten me using actual examples what you have written sounds like the ravings of a glue sniffing troglodyte
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,im just not a lover of evs call me old fashioned but i be the last man standing to give up my petrol car
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,blackmamba12345 thats not even a valid point it wont happen in my life time
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,i wont have an ev any time will continue to drive my 15 year old mazda
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,im sure there are people with steam cars complaining about it 100 years ago
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,robtt997 i guess you dont live near any city then
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,jusb1066 why would that be relevant
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,robtt997 im driving my 20 year old clio
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,mancavehobbies6213 may well come sooner than you think the average age of cars in uk is ten years old as they will stop making new ice cars from 2030 onwards then i would imagine by 2050 most new ice cars will have been scrapped then there will be no demand for petrol and diesel plus the gvt will probs keep increasing the tax to a great deal more so thats around 28 years from now so unless youre 80 years old then it will likely happen in your lifetime
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,robtt997 its as relevant as clinging on to internal combustion now something far more efficient now exists a few old people stuck in their ways are not relevant
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,blackmamba12345 diesel will not go anywhere until there is a working alternative to diesel lorries for goods transport electrics work fine for city but for long haul not so much batteries eat into the max gvw too much and range is very limited
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,jusb1066 ev is heavy so not great steering and just dull i drive on country roads where a petrol car is just a superior steer use of child labour getting materials to make battery also upsets me
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,brorappelsin just you wait youll see the gvt will start increasing tax a lot more on diesel you think its expensive now would you be willing to pay say 10 or more per litre they could easily do that then you would literally be priced off the roads and hgvs are now looking at alternative fuels such as electric trucks so i think youll find the days of diesel are limited and electric car ranges are going up by the year for example many tesla can do over 300 miles and even the more affordable corsa e or peugeot 208 e can do up to 250 miles youre living in the past
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,robtt997 children dont work in opencast lithium mines they are unable to reach the pedal of the 250 tonne trucks children however are killed en mass in war zones for the oil
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,blackmamba12345 ill pay whetever it costs provided that my salary increases üòÅ again i wasnt talking about cars or their ranges at all ive got a passat ecofuel petrolcng and a diesel octavia so im aware of the alternatives i do want to get an electric car when i can afford one with the rqnge i need as my commute is 77km each way and we do have real winter over here in finland so its pretty cold for half of the year peugeot 208 was quite tempting but sadly still out of my price range
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,blackmamba12345 i be 86 by then if i live that long like i said wont happen in my life time
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,mancavehobbies6213 ah well youll have to revert to your mobility scooter least thats electric lol
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,oh no its electric üò¢
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,whats the matter if its electric
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,what happens if you get a power cut
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,nigelrudd670 you cant recharge an ev nor can you fill up a petrol car because pumps need electricity to run so youd be stuffed too you muppet
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,nigelrudd670 in the event of a power cut you cant get petrol either because theres nothing to pump it however my house produces over 10 kw of electricity from solar panels
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,nigelrudd670 you keep going bevause the likihood of you being out of juice when the power cut is on is highly unlikely and power cuts only last for a few hours at most
2022-11-28,pMJ2fEhN-Vc,madm4tty been looking at the ev6 iconic stuff ahhaa
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,jonny is honestly one of the few that has gone from traditional media to social media and is really good at it may it be reviews like this one indepth geeky videos updates on his personal fleet or anything involving richard porter its always enjoyable
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i have pinned this not because i necessarily believe it to be true but in the hope that a brand will see the light and sponsor the channel thanks
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow i cant believe you dont have a sponsor yet are people mental this channel will be going places with its amazing and very well shot content you were born to do this jonny with you calm yet very witty and knowledgable style
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow i really hope that happens for you and most importantly you get to retain creative control
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i agree the thing that really makes the channel watchable for me is that jonny hasnt put him self in any of the more traditional motoring tribes hes not ev or nothing and hes not grrr petrol i know if i click on a lake brake show video it will be a well researched to the point that he isnt afraid to read from a little notebook well thought out and very nicely filmed his passion for all things car related comes across in every video without having to be in your face shouty
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,well said hes taken on board helpful constructive criticism and moved the show on professionally im signing up as a paid subscriber i just cant stand the word ptreon even though i just said it
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow love your casual approach and natural presenting style jonny detailed and entertaining hope you find a sponsor that fits with your brand and ethos
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow well it is true jonny and the key is that youre focused on the topics rather than on trying to be a presenter which is what most youtube car folk seem to concentrate on alas you have the advantage of being a naturally excellent presenter of course
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,his mrs is even funniersorry johnny
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,totally in agreement fullychargedshows review is a complete joke compared to this one
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,if we start a petition to get jonny sponsorship and just over half the people who watch this channel sign it they have to debate it in parliament that will get some attention dont you think come on people in fact i will i just started it httpspetitionparliamentukpetitions562716sponsorsnewtokenjv0l0n3xdg1sjywg_du0
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,its a really solid review and a pleasure to watch it leaves the fully charged review of the same car so far behind in the dust no offense meant to robert but their reviews are just not at this level of writing and production thanks for bringing the quality
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,hard to argue with this even when i dont love the car being featured its always interesting
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,paolo bernasconi i wonder if this may help you for context im in australia your experience may be different i no longer use the app to watch yt i use firefox instead i only get one advert at the start of each clip and occasionally one in the middle on the app yt was simply unwatchable and with what i reckon will be the everupward trajectory of jonnys show it will only get worse if my understanding is correct however its important to realise that the number and frequency of adverts is nothing to do with the particular channel youre viewing ie not jonnys fault or within his control
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow you should have more confidence in yourself jonny youre a great presenter and are one of my favourite car people in the last 10 years right up there with harris and needell youve a level of knowledge and professionalism that far exceeds influencers whove largely bought their way into youtube success by having rich daddys who can indulge their expensive habits each to their own but its not something i remotely care about or want to watch i also dont like people who play for the camera which a lot of influencers do youre just far more natural at this ive also enjoyed you bringing your wife into some of the recent videos too its obvious how much you care about her and i bet you troll each other constantly keep up the great work mate
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,action cant be the small battery becuase its going to be so less active
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow epic presented as ever and really nice filming and editing real quality
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow if thats the direction you wish to go you need to stop using the term car pervert it maybe apt but it will leave many corporate types cold but you probably already know that also comparing bobbyllews figures for a much younger channel your figures are looking far healthier
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow a brand called netflix would be excellent
2020-12-14,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow way more relatable and engaging than mat lets drag race teslas everyday watson
2024-03-20,JSwvQE0tgyM,great and useful review for the second hand market now
2024-02-25,JSwvQE0tgyM,easily the worst late brake video
2024-01-30,JSwvQE0tgyM,fiat for the win
2023-10-25,JSwvQE0tgyM,october 2023 fiat 500e club on facebook the high voltages in an ev requires mechanics to have safety training and special equipment may be needed in fact my nearest fiat dealer cant service my la prima because of lack of training and equipment
2023-10-21,JSwvQE0tgyM,i like this design more than the one of the minicooper especially the interior
2023-09-11,JSwvQE0tgyM,i dont think it compares with a vw eu or a mini or honda e battery cooling range and charging speed are way better
2023-08-11,JSwvQE0tgyM,i am a taycan owner and i love this little ev car i think i am gonna buy one üòç
2023-06-01,JSwvQE0tgyM,this car can sell on looks alone looks both fantastic and unique hats off to fiat on producing a ground up ev of this size not a cobbled together conversion they just need to get the price down if they want to shift real numbers
2023-05-31,JSwvQE0tgyM,im just not sold on evs we are not ready for them
2023-02-18,JSwvQE0tgyM,whats the range of the 42kwh at constant 70mph
2022-12-11,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice looking car and you made it sound good as a towncity car
2022-11-23,JSwvQE0tgyM,i loved the first gen but the range felt so limited even when i got the range up to 111 miles it really lacked excitement knowing i would have to charge it soon i really do hope doubling the range is what the 500 needs but really do hope to see a 500 with 500 miles of range
2022-11-10,JSwvQE0tgyM,if they can get 42kw in the fiat then why couldnt hondaüòÆ
2022-11-10,JSwvQE0tgyM,got a 500e on a subscription i like automatic cars to creep and the fiat only does that in normal my honda e was much more refined loaded and comfortable but 10k more
2022-10-30,JSwvQE0tgyM,i really enjoyed this show excellent interesting and entertaining i have been very opposed to evs thinking them a technical and economic blind alley doomed to eventually fail but this car may be different it is making me think hmmmm maybe and it would fit into our lives well my wife and i have a lot of experience of small cars from the fiat group over the years delta hf turbo punto x19 500 and now a panda 4x4 diesel all have been great cars so perhaps our positive prejudice towards small fiats helps me accept this ev the design and styling is fantastic
2022-10-23,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review i ordered a 500 the only thing i dort understand is the honda e thing the design study was great the production version is more than disappointing
2022-09-10,JSwvQE0tgyM,an informative detailed norazz review thanks
2022-07-15,JSwvQE0tgyM,jonny just seen this great review and just to mention you might have felt awkward back then in those clothes but they certainly did not look bad
2022-07-15,JSwvQE0tgyM,when i ask my self the fiat man what car do you want in your driveway watching this review first car that comes to mind is the mini and why because it has 170 horsepower if i remember right and would even put a smile on my middle aged depressed face but i love the fiat but also the honda
2022-05-31,JSwvQE0tgyM,the previous fiat 500 was launched in 2008and given a facelift in 2015 originally just available as a petrol car then as a hybrid five years later 2013 and an electric only version in 2019
2022-05-21,JSwvQE0tgyM,looking at this for my first car its so cuteee
2022-04-29,JSwvQE0tgyM,its awesome car if you spend 95 percent of your time in a city i actually love how it looks best looking 500 so far i love modern touches ui graphics are nice lovely design details inside out and long range may be actually useful
2022-04-23,JSwvQE0tgyM,the 500e in california is a compliance car frank stephenson designer extraordinaire wants a honda e i would lick johnnys pinkey blinders any time üòã
2022-04-18,JSwvQE0tgyM,i also reviewed the fiat 500e cabrio in my channel and i have to say i was impressed with how fiat has managed to maintain the classic style whilst being modern at the same time but i also feel like it does come at a price and that too less practicality solutions
2022-02-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,does anyone know if the drivers seat goes back anymore im 6ft 4inch will i feel comfortable driving
2022-02-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,johnny please try drive a rhd fiat no room for your left foot i honestly dont know how they let it out of the factory its that bad im so disappointed
2022-01-23,JSwvQE0tgyM,if your wife still saves feed bags for fabric it could be an affordable car for living in the city
2022-01-21,JSwvQE0tgyM,wait till the italian made electrics start foooking up on that lot lets not forget how terribly assembled the italian make a car
2022-01-20,JSwvQE0tgyM,i like everything about this car except the price i can never afford one if the government want me to switch then it will have to go down the chinese route small and cheap yes i understand they are heavily subsidised but if i could get one for 10k id go and buy one as it is ill drive a petrol car till i die which is a shame but a situation not of my making
2021-12-24,JSwvQE0tgyM,honestly jonny i have watched and compared these small elctric cars and penny for penny i am still unconvinced that giving up my petrol fiesta would be an advantage to going electric and as scotland has reported it will not enforce the only electric vehicles until 2040 thenn what i have should see me out
2021-12-13,JSwvQE0tgyM,please stop to compare with honda fiat is a fiat honda is a honda could you please compare with mini se
2021-12-01,JSwvQE0tgyM,shame they both ruined the look and made it bigger than the petrol version yet more unnecessary bloat in car sizes
2021-11-30,JSwvQE0tgyM,pleased its not being made in poland that should reduce its embedded carbon emissions depending on where the steel is made cleaner electricity in piedmont than poland and the city versions smaller battery will also reduce the carbon content significantly
2021-11-26,JSwvQE0tgyM,its beautiful but tbh it looks like a concept car lol anyways am gonna zunk it cause am all the way here in west africa where electricity isnt that great so am kinda curious as to why fiat didnt manufacture the non electric models fuel consumption models
2021-11-23,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review love this car going to test drive this model on friday really hope i like it i love my current 500 lounge
2021-10-24,JSwvQE0tgyM,lovely car ordered mine la prima in ocean green two month ago and cant wait until i get it
2021-10-12,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice looking carbut a 2020 corsa electric with low mileage is 2122k and ive not seen these fiats for less than 24k in the corsa you get extra doors more passenger and boot space slightly longer range considering fiats motto over here is fix it again tomorrow i wouldve thought theyd be more competitive on pricing instead its very much a case of paying more for less
2021-09-16,JSwvQE0tgyM,im getting one for a weekend to try how charging will be already driven one for a day its awesome city
2021-09-16,JSwvQE0tgyM,the long range version i could live with that range without many issues
2021-09-16,JSwvQE0tgyM,the one pedal driving was very weird but not difficult to get used to
2021-08-22,JSwvQE0tgyM,i like more the previous design
2021-08-20,JSwvQE0tgyM,the honda has a plain horrible design on the outside way too plain and robot like the fiat actually has some real finesse to its design specially run the headlights and the bulges above the wheels
2021-08-10,JSwvQE0tgyM,my wife has suggested one of these to replace our leaf i sat in one of these at the late brake show live in kent this weekend my feet genuinely do not fit without pressing both pedals at once also my left foot does not fit on the foot rest without touching the brake pedal our daughter wouldnt fit in the back without removing her legs first not suitable for us but they seem like a great little city car if you fit in it
2021-08-06,JSwvQE0tgyM,the cabrio has no competition only the smart has a cabrio but that has a rang of 63mls apart from that there are zero electrical cabrios
2021-07-17,JSwvQE0tgyM,possibly my next car
2021-07-14,JSwvQE0tgyM,jonny have you now driven the 500e in right hand drive reviewers find that there is knowhere to rest the left foot is the right hand drive conversion a bit of a disappointment
2021-07-12,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice looking car too bad not in the states i would replace my imiev with a 500e i like the 500 look great for around town and going to the city enough range to do what i want and with a ccs can charge it back up quickly is the hardtop a hatchback one thing about the imiev it holds a lot when the rear seats are folded flat looks like a fun 2 person car
2021-07-12,JSwvQE0tgyM,thanks for this great review i live in the us and fiat pulled out of the states so sad i had leased the 500e in 2017 and enjoyed it immensely but i guess americans love of big cars doomed the previous 500e version especially with its 90 mile range so i ended up with a 2020 hyundai ioniq limited dont get me wrong its super nice and detailed as the limited is the top trim of the all electric version but its really more car than i need i am a single senior thats retired but wanting to stay green and have another electric car fiat pulled out of the us market as sales fell partly because of the range issue but also because fiat never did any changes or upgrades to its model 500e in all the years it was in the united states fiat should have introduced this newer version and gave it a chance in the us market before pulling out totally this review shows all the new design features inside and out plus the top models increased range which is superior to my top trim hyundai ioniq model with some similar features equal to my ioniq the united states need a small car that is an ev for upper lower income and for lower middle income earners and for students young families and 55 seniors who really arent looking for 200 mile range and costing 40k and up that said fiat has designed this great model but as in the uss past cant just sit back and wait for its sales to drop off before making design or feature changes fiat needs to stay current with other evs in the ev market jim san diego ca
2021-07-09,JSwvQE0tgyM,i quite like it definitely looks more aggressive than the previous model but retaining its very unique looks i can see why theyre so popular and decent range for a small ev
2021-07-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,a review with a calming vibe to it
2021-07-06,JSwvQE0tgyM,with all the excessive boot space they need to figure out how to include a spare a big boot doesnt do me any good if ive got a gaping flat in january its wet its snowing and my fake spare is under the car ferchrissakes or if im driving through montana at 200 am and there simple aint no roadside assistance til morning and ivegot a gap in my tire i can change a spare myself at 200 if only theyd let me
2021-06-17,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice vid once again jonny but did i miss that vital piece of info the price please could you tell me as an owner of 3 previous fiat 500s have fiat addressed the bloody awful driving position adjustability of the steering wheel will it slide in and out oo er missusand up and down im really loving the e car and i would probably buy one on a pcp but not if that driving position is still crap obw im 6 cheers budüòé
2021-06-12,JSwvQE0tgyM,we picked ours up yesterday la prima with the long range battery im amazed how good it is
2021-06-11,JSwvQE0tgyM,what about the slow speed sound how does it sound inside and can you tune it down
2021-06-10,JSwvQE0tgyM,cool video u own me test drive dude
2021-06-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,were swapping our nissan leaf for a fiat hopefully in june its on order well miss the leaf but are looking forward to the extra mileage and the soft top great review
2021-05-30,JSwvQE0tgyM,love the review and what a lovely car
2021-05-28,JSwvQE0tgyM,1548 me reading about the jimny if it was sold in my coutry it could have the price tag twice or thrice as much as the hilux
2021-05-22,JSwvQE0tgyM,115 mile range is all that is needed for city use most days
2021-05-21,JSwvQE0tgyM,lets face it that italian is a sexy beast there is something about the overall look of it that is both masculine and feminine at the same time and most importantly there are no bad angles it just looks good from each of the 360 degrees we have available is it a performer is it reliable hello its a fiat so kind of but thats not the point if it were about all about that wed all be on bmw or ducati motorcycles with slicks suited up with steel pads covering our knees at a certain point in life you just want a fun ride that everyone else respects as an adults vehicle and the 500 is exactly that i think theyll be well received if i were in a living situation appropriate for one id have one
2021-05-18,JSwvQE0tgyM,so where is the review no mention about any of its attributes comfort handling etc etc you sure mentioned every other e car out there enough more so than actually reviewing this car car looks great but but again where is the review
2021-05-06,JSwvQE0tgyM,just had a loner one when my alfa was at service what a great little car the tech is quite good i didnt expect that honestly the screen feels little weird is its not pointing towards toe driver the powertrain feels strong and makes the car move with quite some punch around town it makes interesting ev noises which i like a lot and add the to driving experience in my opinion the normal driving mode is well calibrated and feels like a nice automatic car without applying a lot of regen braking in the other two range friendly modes the regen braking is pretty aggressive and need some getting used to the ride quality isnt the best ok earth but i was expecting way worse form a swb affordable car its not soft but the suspension did absorb bumps and road imperfections pretty nicely the build quality is somewhat inconsistent around the car some party feel well made and high quality and others seem to have been but together by a blind person in the dark for example the stitching is so bad that you dont have to look at is the figure that out it felt cheap but its doesnt really matter in my opinion the radar cruise control does a fantastic job too and its very easy to operate this car makes a lot of sens as a daily commute city car cheers
2021-05-06,JSwvQE0tgyM,this car seems very nice but for the price it is up there with the likes of the bmw i3 which is a more premium brand and offers far better space inside the car
2021-04-22,JSwvQE0tgyM,thanks for the review youre rightit will draw a crowd that wouldnt have looked at an electric car beforehand i was going to buy another petrol audi before i saw this review i now have a fiat 500e on order
2021-04-19,JSwvQE0tgyM,personally from evs i drove most of them suck i like the vw eup though it is a basic car with everything u have and it is quite nice to drive and be in but nobody could beat the bmw i3 imo
2021-04-19,JSwvQE0tgyM,hired a fiat 500 a few years back and it was fun to get around the city not great on the motorway too short at high speed for my liking im surprised that tgearbixevs dont have a two speed box like an electric overdrive surely that could increase high speed
2021-04-14,JSwvQE0tgyM,sherpa i think of a mountain climber like 4x4 low range mode bullocks now i am dissapointed it would be cool with a climber mode
2021-04-09,JSwvQE0tgyM,the little lamb of agnelli happy to see you goes electric
2021-04-07,JSwvQE0tgyM,at 1652 why be a 500 guy is better üòâ you know that parking on a sidewalk is not that legal but people will say cmon is a tiny 500 they are forced to park that way we can walk easily yes that would be 50 best ever is the other 50 they wont ever notice it then you see a suv on the sidewalk is it your that bunch of xxap buy a smaller car you idiot people forgive the tiny 500 because is a people car minimal and nice park the suv and the elders will point at you their walking batons trust me
2021-03-27,JSwvQE0tgyM,i really hope the usa will get these i will buy the long range cabrio in a heartbeat i was planning on buying a used ev this year but this is apparently the same price after incentives as my budget i would very much prefer the 500e cabrio over the chevy bolti really hope its available soon need a new car after the pandemicüòÅ
2021-03-27,JSwvQE0tgyM,always loved your reviews but i didnt need the peaky blinders history lesson i came to seehear about the car
2021-03-21,JSwvQE0tgyM,this channel is tv quality on you tube as others have said the production quality is fantastic sponsorship highly deserved and i wish you every success jonny
2021-03-18,JSwvQE0tgyM,johnnys the best car review presenter bar none so natural and funny
2021-03-12,JSwvQE0tgyM,you wont sell me on electric the range is rubbish over what was an already fantastically economical car in petrol guise and was cheaper to buy too
2021-03-11,JSwvQE0tgyM,lose all the internal tech just give us power windows heat and ac in a car with a 100 mile range at 70 mph and under 10k new our phones will handle the tech that would be a huge success
2021-03-10,JSwvQE0tgyM,bruxel porque tantos comerciais de carros para mim se n√°o estou interessado em adquirir
2021-03-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,absolutely stunning car wow the production value on this is amazing i would love to see an abarth version
2021-03-01,JSwvQE0tgyM,design point of view what else to say italy beauty in four wheels besides great range reasonable cost has all elements for a commercial success i like it
2021-02-23,JSwvQE0tgyM,not upto the mark review that becomes boaring and not in sequence
2021-02-22,JSwvQE0tgyM,johnny historically dont italian cars suffer with electronic issues and then they ask samsung to put a battery in the car seems like tempting fate to me üò¨
2021-02-18,JSwvQE0tgyM,thanks great review i also like your outfit please share details of your awkward outfit it looks good
2021-02-18,JSwvQE0tgyM,looks like a nice car and i very much like the ocean green colour another italian built car that will come out this year is the microlino microcar i hope that by the time it comes out you will be able to travel to italy to review it
2021-02-18,JSwvQE0tgyM,this car is beautiful
2021-02-07,JSwvQE0tgyM,im not going to lie as an american viewing this channel for the first timethe only thing that kept me here was the gorgeous gentleman doing the review subscribedlikedand needing a cool drink üòâ
2021-02-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,it was only sold in cali and oregon because it is a compliance car
2021-02-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,is this a four seater car
2021-02-01,JSwvQE0tgyM,not my choice but as you say if the ice version appealed to a market segment this should appeal to them equally i also totally agree that getting people behind the wheel of an ev just one time is what is needed i let everybody drive my chevy bolt because i know how it changes your mind based on my test drive
2021-01-31,JSwvQE0tgyM,for so long we have been waiting for the three main bigname small cars to go electric mini fiat and honda and now they are all finally here together what a wonderful sight it is which is best is a question people have been pondering for the combustion versions for decades and no ones come up with a clear answer yet most likely this will continue as well for the electric ones but this continuing competition will help all 3 to rise to superiority and stardom in the end either way
2021-01-29,JSwvQE0tgyM,the 200 mile range will sell like hot cookie if proceed at 35k usd
2021-01-28,JSwvQE0tgyM,electricmade in italyg wiz great to see they have changed the model for the electric version spec looks impressive and its fantastic that they have two versions water cooled batteries impressive too however i would have more faith in a car built in poland super review jonny
2021-01-16,JSwvQE0tgyM,i just want to point out that the former model of the 500 e was available in norway as well it didnt sell very well though for obvious reasons but you can still get them for quite cheap theres a dealership 10 minutes walk from my home and theyve got dozens of them for sale
2021-01-10,JSwvQE0tgyM,good start nice styling now lose 10k off the price and you might be in the starting blocks at the current prices theyre just a middle class divertissement
2021-01-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,this may not be what you want to hear but i can guess with a high level of confidence that a lot of sponsors will be not be keen on the old car pervert slogannickname if you like and will want it purged from all social media and videos deacriptions etc i personally dont give a monkeys about it as at the end of the day you are superb at what you do and i want to watch everything you produce on your channel but as we know it is not free to make content weekly i do hope someone reaches outs to you you and autogefuhl are the best on youtube to watch thumbs up and a comment for the yt algorythms watching from londres
2021-01-07,JSwvQE0tgyM,what happens with the electric door handles if you crash into water and need to get out of the car
2021-01-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review cheers from sunny greece
2021-01-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,you made a great presentation of fiat 500 e you made me to buy itmy compliments from macedonia greece
2021-01-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,finally getting excited about electric cars now love this new fiat 500e
2021-01-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,la 500 del 2017 ci fu imposta dal governo usa questa √® la prima vera 500 elettrica non costruita in messico non concepita in oregon p s evitiamo le tarantelle please e si scrivo in italiano sotto un video che richiama il padrino ed appunto usa la tarantella come colonna sonora
2021-01-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,jonny nice video bud hope to cross paths in ireland or the uk or the us for some bmw videos
2021-01-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,fiatfix it again tonythe mexican built fiat 500s were a disasterthey were sold in canada as wellheres to the triumph of hope over experience
2021-01-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice design has personality
2021-01-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i believe that nobody will buy a car with 2 types of autonomy and power a castrated car
2021-01-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,this is kinda like the honda e absolutly stunning unfortunately with such a limited range this car has doomed itself because of ignorant developers with their own head up their arse a car like this would be amazing for the smaller countries like denmark but no one will buy it the price will be 27049 for the cheapest model for the danes and no one will pay that amount for a 100 mile range vehichle its outrageous to put this thing on the market
2020-12-31,JSwvQE0tgyM,the old version of the fiat 500e was also available in the canadian provinces of british columbia and quebec and ontario as they have had rebates for evs there are a good number of them zipping around in the vancouver area
2020-12-31,JSwvQE0tgyM,the price is not 19990 the price is over 30000 buy abarth 500 that is cheaper and have fun
2020-12-30,JSwvQE0tgyM,how does it drive how does it feel and sound this was a presentation not a review first time ive come across your channel and i dare say that youve gone soft johnny
2020-12-30,JSwvQE0tgyM,just love jonnys take on things great review keep em coming
2020-12-27,JSwvQE0tgyM,its a shame fiat has decided there is no market for their e car in the usa especially since they improved the range im guessing they would have sold more units of the 21 model over here
2020-12-27,JSwvQE0tgyM,a real authentic report and presenter i loved the experience just like i was in birmingham and driving the car there i write posts on wwwmecrofoneblog and definitely i am gonna upload the video and the article on the blog
2020-12-26,JSwvQE0tgyM,the soft top roof is great especially in the uk where the sun is appreciated as it is not often around for long particularly up north
2020-12-26,JSwvQE0tgyM,like the car the presenter and the history lesson3 for 3
2020-12-26,JSwvQE0tgyM,in the e ranges i think id prefer a cortina 1600e or a jaguar xke not too struck on the toyota carina e
2020-12-26,JSwvQE0tgyM,another slow charge car yawn
2020-12-25,JSwvQE0tgyM,beautiful production and a lovely car i would have appreciated a few more technical details though for example does the heating system use a heat pump more efficient but also more complex than a resistance element does the electric motordrive unit have any unique features is the final drive ratio numerically high or low this can affect longterm durability your onscreen comparisons were great looking forward to more in the future
2020-12-24,JSwvQE0tgyM,this fiat have the look the honda should have had hondas concept car was real cool the final product was as beige as tommy shelbys whiskey induced droppings
2020-12-24,JSwvQE0tgyM,a lot of the previous 500 electric in norway so not only available in the us
2020-12-24,JSwvQE0tgyM,my bad seems like they bought up leasing fleets and resold them with new car warranty from fiat norway
2020-12-23,JSwvQE0tgyM,im really looking forward to an ev panda cross which will likely be based on the same platform as this much as the current and previous pandas are based on the same platform as the 500 to the best of my knowledge
2020-12-22,JSwvQE0tgyM,now to wait for bjorn nylands test where he tells us whether the 500e rapidgates gets hot after motorway driving charges slowly or coldgates charges slowly in cold weather spec is one thing realword performance another
2020-12-22,JSwvQE0tgyM,like the plastic mounted in indonesia from the australian carbage which were supposed to be recycled i would very much like to see a video where they recycle the sea plastic into car seat fabric to believe it
2020-12-22,JSwvQE0tgyM,i think the honda e is the cooler car unless you really want the big sunroof lol
2020-12-21,JSwvQE0tgyM,man this car is beautiful and it makes me even prouder to be italian
2020-12-21,JSwvQE0tgyM,looks good jonny i like this car with its new aggressive stance apart from the stupid electric hand brake switch thing and no cd player
2020-12-20,JSwvQE0tgyM,fca please please please bring the new 500e to north america
2020-12-20,JSwvQE0tgyM,i must admit and i think they are expensive and i have heard other people say the same they are waiting for the prices to come down for small cars they are still too expensive
2020-12-20,JSwvQE0tgyM,i was all set to gush at how youve turned a download of tech info into a sumptuous visual and auditory experience until you said you were getting out of those clothes as theyre making you feel a bit awkward so ive changed tack ditch the shirt if you like but ffs keep the pants and boots they suit you perfectly
2020-12-19,JSwvQE0tgyM,this is not true to the 500 spirit anymore this is a car for people who would buy ice cream for their dogs and wear prada slippers
2020-12-18,JSwvQE0tgyM,i think ev is fitting for fiat 500
2020-12-18,JSwvQE0tgyM,love this video fiat has done an awesome job with this car my god johnny are you getting sexier with every video
2020-12-17,JSwvQE0tgyM,great looking car id definitely have one at the right price also the honda e is nice but the screens inside put me off its like something from pimp my ride
2020-12-15,JSwvQE0tgyM,i miss the car p e r v e r t
2020-12-14,JSwvQE0tgyM,fab video nicely put together an honest opinion too what a great little car
2020-12-14,JSwvQE0tgyM,i was sent to birmingham on a one month refresher course by my companyi didnt meet not even one english personother wise i really enjoyed birmingham
2020-12-13,JSwvQE0tgyM,im only 2 minutes into this video and i just have to say that i appreciate the production and thoughts that you included in this video the history comparison specs and tour of the fiat are spectacular by far the greatest 500e video
2020-12-13,JSwvQE0tgyM,the realworld range on the fiat is amazing
2020-12-13,JSwvQE0tgyM,stylish little rascaland the car of course
2020-12-12,JSwvQE0tgyM,dreaming of the day that theyll change their mind and make this come to canada i am a 2017 retro edition driver myself and would buy this in a heartbeat
2020-12-12,JSwvQE0tgyM,im honestly hoping for a 124 electric version maybe based on some of the battery tech in this ive always wanted a lightweight roadster but cant excuse buying a gas car ever again
2020-12-12,JSwvQE0tgyM,1050 the real drawback of the zoe is the limitation to 46kw charging whereas the 500e will do 85kw doesnt matter all that much in the city but there you dont really need the increased range of the zoe either but for that long range trip once in a while it makes a huge difference and the 500e is quite a bit cheaper as well if renault offered a 75kw charging option for the zoe it would be the better value
2020-12-12,JSwvQE0tgyM,this is a beautiful car and very good video
2020-12-12,JSwvQE0tgyM,as an italian i can say that fiat is very bad at innovation except for this car they finally understood that you dont have to go too much futuristic when making electric cars i just wish that acceleration was a bit faster 5 sec 060 or something
2020-12-11,JSwvQE0tgyM,good reviews on this channel a bit cheeky great stuff
2020-12-11,JSwvQE0tgyM,thanks for the peaky blinders style review jonny a very likable car interestingly ah laser quest the dark abyss where children were sent to play with heavy plastic weaponry life endangering obstacles and would return with hard to explain bruises ps love the tear as in rip of a clown ignition off sound too
2020-12-11,JSwvQE0tgyM,wish theyd of invented a eco friendly biofuel you can use with older vehicles instead of going to electric im not a tech guy at all just want to look after and run my vw bora mk1 sierra forever
2020-12-11,JSwvQE0tgyM,sorry nobody in the us has ever accepted an ugly car unless they were inexpensive
2020-12-11,JSwvQE0tgyM,boring extended review and piss weak verdict sorry
2020-12-11,JSwvQE0tgyM,20k yeah i pass give me ice engine for 1000
2020-12-10,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice car good video
2020-12-10,JSwvQE0tgyM,fabulous looking ev had so much fun owning regular fiat 500 id love on of these great design excellent video you have a new subscriber
2020-12-10,JSwvQE0tgyM,what about the corsa ev does it compare
2020-12-10,JSwvQE0tgyM,had the original 500e and loved it now have the model3 cannot wait for teslas version of the sub compact car
2020-12-10,JSwvQE0tgyM,i still cant believe that the eup and citygo mii are no longer being made with its proper hatchback they are such practical ecars that said the 500e does look way better no doubt about that
2020-12-10,JSwvQE0tgyM,how much is this car
2020-12-10,JSwvQE0tgyM,simply the best car reviews around everything you need to know about a car in an entertaining package without being frivolous
2020-12-10,JSwvQE0tgyM,i very much hope that nissan brings the zoey to the us so i have that option i expect that my wrx will last at most another 35 years and i will be buying an electrice vehilce to replace it
2020-12-10,JSwvQE0tgyM,i live in the andes in southern argentina where the passion for the fiat 500600 is amazing the restored or restomod festivals are amazing
2020-12-09,JSwvQE0tgyM,i think the hondae is quirkyfugly and the pathetic range and high price just kills it dead this is a much better looking car and more affordable if youre after a small car
2020-12-09,JSwvQE0tgyM,never thought i would say this but your making me want a fiat havent owned a fiat since me first cara fiat uno haha
2020-12-09,JSwvQE0tgyM,stunning little car want one
2020-12-09,JSwvQE0tgyM,brilliant review johnny
2020-12-09,JSwvQE0tgyM,lol ≈°erpa means pot in my language fitting for a fiat xd just kidding i drive an alfa
2020-12-09,JSwvQE0tgyM,love your reviews jonny still the best mate always enjoyable that little 500 is so stylish a great fun city car
2020-12-09,JSwvQE0tgyM,great film as ever
2020-12-09,JSwvQE0tgyM,when you mentioned the eup its worth noting the citigoe iv dropped off the market a while back too after just only a few short months you cant even buy a petrol citigo anymore
2020-12-09,JSwvQE0tgyM,yet again another ecar review that completely overlooks interior environment factors im referring to heating and cooling is this vehicle able to keep you warm and in winter cool in summer can it heat enough to clear ice and snow off the windshield if it can how much energy will it take and what impact will it have on the range how about a littles less attention to frivolous details like decals and and a little more attention to whether its a realistic and practical option
2020-12-09,JSwvQE0tgyM,a themed car review very good
2020-12-09,JSwvQE0tgyM,whats the effect on performance with change in weather temperature i live in utah where the annual temperature swing is 40c to 15c what happens to battery performance under these conditions also how well do they work with steep inclines theres a canyon on i80 thats steep enough to kill off a few motor homes per year they usually catch firewhats the ev battery drain like on hills
2020-12-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,late brake show or car pervertmake your mind up
2020-12-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,i am the carpervert the show is called the late brake show
2020-12-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,wanted to watch a review of the 500e but not enough to put with jonny obllocks and its complete hsite patter
2020-12-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,would love to see if that door handle works in a heavy frost uk weather has cripple many a tesla
2020-12-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,personally trust the polish to build a better car than the italians but what do i know d
2020-12-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,dapper dan oooh suits you sir will you be seeing a lady this evening üòâ
2020-12-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,hey jonny id just like to add that i thought your production value was great on this possibly just possibly a bit too much slomo but im being picky i just love your content its whats missing on tv yes i enjoy top gear but its an entertainment show that uses cars as props i particularly like your reviews on electric cars and specifically the retro fits well done for jfdi and youre doing it brilliantly i also think the name change is a good move
2020-12-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,another electric junk the abarth is cool this is lame
2020-12-07,JSwvQE0tgyM,i like it may prefer the older model style wise but this is cool but id still probably look at the zoe for the extra range im super excited to see where we stand in 2 3 maybe 4 years with evs so many seem to fear these cars im excited zoe got updated recently more range and better interior and exterior touch ups as you know ofc kia is bringing a new platform next year look very exciting 300 mile range and stuff
2020-12-07,JSwvQE0tgyM,johnny the reason it was sold in ca and or is for carb california air resource board compliance for the manufacturer theres a requirement that in order to sell gas or diesel cars in ca you have to have an electric vehicle for sale in ca as well these compliance cars have all been universally acknowledged as junk httpsenwikipediaorgwikicompliance_car
2020-12-07,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review jonny nice setting music and i even liked the car
2020-12-07,JSwvQE0tgyM,just found the channel love the content and your review style very entertaining and informative
2020-12-07,JSwvQE0tgyM,zoe every time
2020-12-07,JSwvQE0tgyM,thought you might have mentioned the 500 31 theres a shot of it at 1453 pretty interesting on a car this small
2020-12-07,JSwvQE0tgyM,jonny smith is the only man who should review electric cars cant watch fc without him anymore he has a great eye for design and is competent to the satisfaction just love him
2020-12-07,JSwvQE0tgyM,ah digbeth i remember it well used to commute up down the m1 to spend the week at the ford depot whilst visiting all the wonderful engineering companies in the area such a watchable production love the cap how many gillettes inside so refreshing compared to these artificial official reviews such as recent lrj defender contrived rubbish
2020-12-06,JSwvQE0tgyM,greatest review the only issue i miss is the range issue many people will get burned by range is 320 wltp but in winter it will be maybe 23 of that but on the freewaymotorway in winter at 130kmh that will be i am thinking 100km instead of 300km range around big cities there are fast roads that people need to take to the workplace
2020-12-06,JSwvQE0tgyM,1156 to 1208 minutes hahaha dodgy roll up windows up smoking jokes
2020-12-06,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review jonny but you ruined the immersion with your last sentence
2020-12-06,JSwvQE0tgyM,another great video from jonny smith former 2014 500e owner from the us here current gm bolt ev owner my two favorite new evs have to be the honda e the new 500e and tie for third would be the zoe eup all of which are unavailable in us maybe i need to move cheers
2020-12-06,JSwvQE0tgyM,fantastic review so stylish so different so 500
2020-12-06,JSwvQE0tgyM,if youre ever about to splurge that capital has no nationality please take a moment to remember that fiat decided to move the production of their successful small car away from one of the best fcas factories in terms of production quality and back to well italy after they already did that with new panda and sacked 1500 people in 2012 yeah no nationality at all
2020-12-06,JSwvQE0tgyM,worst tv percenter ever
2020-12-06,JSwvQE0tgyM,just review the car stop talking nonsense no details whatsoever about the car gimmicks and how it drives
2020-12-06,JSwvQE0tgyM,great car in great settings
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,electric doors in an italian car
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,not more ev
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,fantastic review jonny and the 500 looks really cool we have had 3 500s over the last 10 years and if we were looking for a new car this would be top of the list thanks
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,1259 i dont see how you can charge up to 427kw in 1525 hours on a 3kw input
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,semiuseful city runabout but 20k more than it should be
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,fiat are masters at small cars it is a pity they dont really bother with them anymore they did not even replace the punto there was a 127 concept that looked fantastic they did nothing with it is it the market though does noone want a small car anymore we will soon all be driving dull as dishwater suvs and cuvs they literally all pretty much look the same except the mitsubishi eclipse cross they have at least tried to make an effort of doing something different the reward they are leaving the uk market in entirety
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,why why did they ruin it such a classic car turned into a watereddown ev
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,i have liked the most recent 500 here in the states but it is smaller then i am ready to go the cabriolet is really neat as an ev pushing up on 200 miles it does feel like a really nice option i like the mini e and have an i3 rex but the range on the mini makes me pause thanks for an interesting review looking forward to being able to take one of these out for a test drive
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,is this the car pervert channel
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,this 500e is perfect for the week than the amg c63 507 for the weekend üòÇ
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,how do evs handle snow ive not seen or heard anything about that subject
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,disappointing 0 to 60 slower than the california 500e more modern but less charming wish i had one of those batteries tho
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,amber brake lights thats how you roll in europe
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,seems that fiat is going to make it a brand of its own just that big 500 logo and no fiat anywhere
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,id say that in these ev reviews you should check how fast they charge depending on the battery charge level etc maybe thats not very relevant for small ones that arent going to go in a long trip but for the rest is important in my opinion
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,are fiat so tight they only bring one car to the uk gc 760nr has been round every youtube reviewer this week but i think yours was the first out
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,very nice exterior electric for the masses
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,very amusing thanks jonny enjoyed this its a nice car fiat drl includes taillights too fix it
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,if i have enough money i would choose fiat 500e
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,i reckon fiat have hit it out of the park with this especially in terms of body stylinggorgeous evolution
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,this car is perfect as an ev
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review by looking at the rivals if you mention the zoe you also have to mention the e208 and corsa the look just much better
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,this causes a dilemma i bought a used powder blue fiat 500 mk2 2013 for my daughter a few years back special birthday v lucky girl and she we all love its it for some reason puts a smile on my face when i see it this ev 500 is on point styling range options and your presentation is just brilliant got to say it for me its up there with figaro evs are the future and this has to be a winner
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,why is it always the top spec modelas not many ever buy that one as its too expensive
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,proud owner of a 72 convertible 500 here the car makes me smile every single time i sit in it fuel consumption is near zero sunny days are happy days and every single date is a success the ev will make you spend near 0 on gas make you enjoy the three sunny daysyear in britain and hopefully become a father within 10 minutes from escaping the talian mob after you are caught the padrinos doughter
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,i have to admit its a bloody good looking car i understand your predicament with the honda e though its equally as cool and fashionable but the interior is so unique
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,good thank you for changing your name a growing channel called car pervert were hard to recommend
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,but no brake light if in single pedal mode
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,i think that you are right in that the 500e will bring interest to the whole electric car thing the one thing that disappointed me about it was the fact that it doesnt have regen on demand matt farah said it was one of the fun things about his chevy volt not using any petrol or brakes and as it is only programming and a couple of levers it seems a shame to leave it out
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,disappointing it would have been nice to hear from a 500 enthusiast who knew more about the cars im not interested in his clothes or birmingham he told us nothing just how he liked other cars more
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,the production of this clip matches the car beautiful keep it up please jonny and team
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,the most beautiful little car in the worldbut a battery is no alternativean abarth though
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,looking really smart jonny i was waiting for your review of this car and as with the many others you have done its a good one
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,i won the original 500e imported from us to norway i love it its not for everyone sure its small and the interior quality is well not the best but i love it and my bmw stays in the garage 90 of the time now its small its sort of fast up to 7080kph and the range is good enough to drive tofrom work its fun this new one seems to fix most of the issues without straying too far from what the 500 is
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,love this car i have the first gen ev500 and i love it never going back to a piston engine again
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,ha i notice how you drove past from a outside shot sun in eyes and you couldnt put the sun visor all way down to block the sun because clearly you would have zero vision of the road you held the visor a few cm down lol you should mention thisclearly you are too tall for this car because you should be able to see with the visor down still
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,i cant drive any car with the sun visor all the way down it comes down to seat adjustment as well remember
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,basically long range you will get at a push 140 miles and the city car pushing 8090 miles real world range and while some look at this car as cheapthough places state the lowest model price to make it look cheaper than what it is the lease prices are 100 more than other much better ev cars
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,a class review those rear steering wheel audio buttons exactly the same as my jeep i think all cars should have them so easy to use
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,i was a bit skeptical about the look of the car but its growing on me especially after your video wow
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,ridiculously overpriced toy for dentists wives to demonstrate their ecoconsciousness for all serious matters they will keep using their cayenne though
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,best ev review ever liked use of charts and music better channel name as well
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,all enjoyable production values aside what really stands out for me is that jonny is not the usual kind of talented and knowledgeable youtuber but a proper journalist who really knows how to tell a story how to deliver facts and how to make a point i dont even drive a car or want one but i watch your videos with pleasure
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,looks a little too aggressive for an ootseycutesy runabout will it capture the same target market as before only time will tell
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,its utter agony that fiat wont just pull the trigger and electrify the panda range id be first in line for an electric panda cross
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,me too but sadly not enough people care about the panda any more
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,i absolutely miss the basic battery version as convertible this is what you need in the city you dont need 300km range dragging dead weight every day
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,when e cars use regen braking comes to a halt when you lift off the power pedal do the brake lights come on to tell the driver behind you that youre coming to a stop
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,usually chevy bolt does bmw i3 too
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,wow theyve done a great job with this car
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,im subscribed to about 60 car channels and this channel is probably up there with my top 3 need i say more i also see the subscriber count is shooting up so i guess a lot of people agree
2020-12-06,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow haha i would do the same funny i used to watch you on fifth gear as a young teen and could never imagine being able to talk to you or other presenters nowadays good ol youtube has changed all that
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,wouldnt it be great if the car pervert and fullycharged teamed upüòä
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,another extremely well done video mate but now ive gotta rewatch your honda e review
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,fiat 500 as an ice is a pos so is the electric one any less
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,vw should bring back beetle as an ev
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,good one johnny been waiting for a good review on this little baddy so disappointing we probably wont get it in australia no govt incentives available here backwards bastards oh reckon you could add some metric numbers to the onscreen specs cards for us properly metric folk down here üòÄ
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,i really wish the fiats we got in the us were better made as they appear to be in europe
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,you knowits probably and excellent vehicle but it looks like a blob i would buy it if i wanted a super reliable city car but as i parked it and walked off i wouldnt turn back to look at it
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,ev is easy to maintain and hassle free
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,nothing like a bit of racial stereotyping to flesh out a simple car review
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,i think that fiat is going to make it a brand of it own
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,jonnys back definitely car review with a story love it
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,congrats on 200k sir oh and a blinder üòâof a review once again thank you
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review as always really enjoyed it i think it comes down to the fact of do you want a 4 seat ev cabrio or not if the answer is yes then theres not much else if anything to choose from
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,looks very like an adam particularly the chrome trim round the side windows to the point id say theyve bought the design or its a joint enterprise and we will see an adam ev soon looks nice but expensive particularly for a fiat 500 part of the 500s charm was its classless pricing our first was a top of the range panorama glass roof twin air 50mpg second one was a 12 sport 65mpg one 10500 other 12500 new ive bought 2 for less than that one and had change for a motorbike
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,why is it strange that this piece of rubbish was only sold in california and oregon answer plain as the nose on your face is that it is a compliance car fiat is resisting going into ev like a virgin into a adult toys shop fiat has no desire to sell these and makes them only because the penalty for not doing so is onerous this car is redundant even before you buy it its only redeeming factor is that its ev and for everyone sold wont be that many an ice car is left unsold
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,you are mistaking the old 500 electric compliance car with this one designed to be electric because the electric cars market is exploding
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,neutronalchemist3241 you have been drawn in by the hype dont for one minute think that fiat is making evs because they want to make evs they like all legacy automakers would far far prefer to not make evs at all ever these companies have been dragged kicking and screaming and crying howls of protest into the ev arena because of three main reasons 1 civilised countries are going to ban the sale of new ice vehicles within the next 10 years 2 ice cars are increasingly penalised with emissions fines which is starting to really hurt them 3 the public is finding evs more economically attractive total cost of ownership not sticker price and in addition are seeing cars like tesla as very desirable tesla was the only car maker to make good profist during the covid pandemic every other car maker suffered big losses fiat is making this piece of rubbish only because they have no choice not becuase they want to
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,brunosmith6925 every company would prefer to do what it has always done but the sales of electric cars in europe rised 50 every year in the last 5 yearsthe actual situation is that if you are a car maker and wants to remain relevant you have to manufacture electric vehicles so what fiat does manufacture electric vehicles thats not building compliance car its building what the market is asking for thats what manufacturers exist for
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow i know i appreciate that and i normally watch them there just seem many more than usual and all at annoying points just as you were about to say something
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow this video should have been named fiat 500e peaky blinders review edition could generate better seo
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,i think that rear wheel drive is the way to go with evs and i used to think otherwise but that is one of the big appealing features of the honda e
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,thats one car shape im sick of seeing almost as bad as the not so mini
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,i work in digbeth its wild seeing johnny drive past my office
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,very enjoyable review the underlying music alongside jonnys dresscode is phenomenal beautiful car also thank you
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,i like it but ill never buy it because i know its a compliance car
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,but if a compliance car is good does that matter
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,i have made due with the range of my 2014 500e with no issues put 40000km on it family of 4 2 dogs no problem
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,great video and a funky car the production of this film is faultless great job loving your content
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,i am a glutton for punishment i am unable to drive but ache to be able to drive specially these electric cars i would instantly buy the fiat 500e
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,the production values of this video are outstanding the use of the slides to show vehicle comparisons and represent information graphically was really informative great work
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,looks great will be interesting to know leasing costs no dodgy ice drivetrain to go wrong italian electrics bits of it are south korean at least
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review johnny
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,awesome review best one so far
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,i like the videos but i dont think i have seen so many adverts in such a short space of time if this is how its going to be i will probably unsubscribe
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,very good to see who does long trips in a fiat 500 anyway the hot version of this should be entertaining when it eventually comes
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,i really hope they do an electric abarth 500 that would genuinely make me convert to electric
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,so much better than the fully charged video
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,enjoyed this video despite the unusual attire will fancy dress based upon location now feature in future videos must be the least gangster like car around looks a fabulous vehicle for those with urban mobility needs and easy access to charging disappointed that no ice version exists the original new fiat 500 also gets better looking by the day a great little car for those on a tight budget
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,i love these reviews jonny but that gang in farnborough will be after you for incorrect use of mini in the graphics they really dont like lower case letters
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,wonderful review this has quickly become my nr 1 go to channel for car reviews jonny knows his stuff whilst striking a great balance between being serious about the facts and being entertaining this channel made me order a mini electric i personally prefer the mini but the fiat and the honda e are great lookers too the more we see of these three cars on the road the better
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,i think fiat have done a really good job i like the design overall apart from the silly bonnet eyebrows shouldve just left the headlights as they are without that embellishment
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,in india we have tata nexon electric with good range and in competitive price range this fiat is lovely
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice test jonny 2 things price italian electrics
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,it is the best little electric car available today good pricerange and styledimension ratios
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,strange ive not seen one reviewer try and get in the back seats
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,what happens if youre in an accident regarding door buttons can you still get out or if theres a power failure will you be stuck in there forever lol
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,happy 200k edit 1301 427 kwh blimey missing a comma there i think
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,love the new fiat cool watch what kind of watch
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,i really like this all to often im seeing manufacturers reinterpretations of their existing models and completely destroy them in order to appear electric this one really has hit the nail on the head though
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,could you please talk more about seat adjustability steering wheel rake etc because the last time i drove a 500 it was the most uncomfortable car i have ever driven
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,1453 is that a clamshell door like on the previous clubman
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,320 what are you talking about the 500e is also available in a new fourdoor version 3 doors plus trunk door i actually think that is the most interesting version because it makes sitting in the back less of a torture
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,sexyboththe car and the mankeep the clothes
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,just amazed by how good it looks it looks exactly how youd imagine a modern ev 500 would look
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,i 3 has it beat on cup holders and thats what you need for a city car
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,im sorry johnny i live in the twin cities minesota i maybe see only one fiat 500 on the road here once every 3 months they just dont sell well here the main fiat dealership in st louis park mn still has brand new fiat 500s still in stock on the lot from the past few years for sale as for evs in this area there are more nissan leafs tesla model ss model 3s being sold here everyday tesla opened a dealership here in eden prairie mn a few years back i do have a great childhood memory of my dad bringing home two used fiats during the summer of 84 he worked as a used car salesman than in 1984 he successively brought home a cherry red 1979 fiat spyder 2000 a dark burgundy 1982 fiat x19 off of his dealership lot to tool around in he ended up selling the x19 to a neighbor across the street our neighbor kept the x19 for a number of years until he traded it for a porche 928s
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,i wouldnt call this a global car given that north america is excluded we lost the regular fiat 500 too about a year or two ago i absolutely love my 2012 and would only replace it with a convertible ev
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,the fiat 500 comes in 3 different model styles but unfortunately they all look virtually the same very feminine styling seems like fiat has given they design staff 3 years off can we please have a new bravo replacement
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,what an exceptionally well designed car
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,the plastic around the gear select and drive mode looks cheap
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,it isnt necessarily cheaper though but range vs cost is best
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,pretty cool but they shouldve made it rear engine rwd like the original
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,i drive when it doesnt stop for a while when the 499cc engines warmed up just let it cool down a 50 year old 500l this looks an excellent addition to the ev world compared to mine this new one is hugeüòÜ its all relative of course well done fiat back to doing what they do best good small cars
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,good production nice stylish little car good job jonny
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,hilariously tesla competition already hitting the wall of limited battery production
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,finally a really good looking budget ev ty fiat ps this roof is a joke
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,i do like this above all the others youve reviewed ill take this and the honda for a test drive in the new year
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,1304 427kwh would be long range indeed
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,what a great little car i think its really cool also the cinematography and graphics are coming along in leaps and bounds its a serious quality production now nice job jonny
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,what a sexy little car i gave up driving about a year or so ago in favour of mountainbiking to work although there are times i miss having the flexibility of a car and if i were to enter the market again itd be for this
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,well if the mini e rides even half as badly as the petrol one its awful plus its far too difficult to get in and out of the 500 is just wonderful honda yes but a hopeless range and too expensive
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,liking you dropped the p word love what you do but it just felt like an out dated term that doesnt suit your content really good review
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,agree with so many comments here a totally watchable entertaining and informative review again they seem to get better and better jonny i think youre totally right about how this expands the interest on this kind of ev and not to deliver a verdict choice should be a personal thing and happily we do seem to be emerging into a world where there are reasonable and well designed alternatives
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,i just watched your friends view on this car fully charged show
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,superb presentation in depth knowledgeable review with style and humour i love the tiein with birminghams old italian quarter and doesnt jonny carry the peaky blinders look with bravura
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,another good bit of jonny but why is organ grinding a skill all you do is crank a handle mate the monkey does the hard work had to stop watching the fully charged show because kryton got on my tits with his relentless evangelising about all things electric so no idea if mr smith still appears there he was the only reason i kept with it so long as i bought that ev brainwashing completely until i explored formyself and discovered the huge inconvenience and extra costs that were glossed over as far as range lets see some realistic actual mileage quoted as well as the meaningless claims got tosay though that then500 is a masterpiece of great design in all iterations maybe a 400 mile abarth firebreathing version might sway me but if i had to go for a small ev the honda e or renault zoe would be one of only three id look at but realistically ill stick my 12 year old german planet burner btw my thoughts when i hear sherpa is to see everest
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,love the chic look of the car range is not bad great review plan and simple but with a bit of comedy as well nice one mate
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice to see you smart for once you scruffy herbert great review again you make dull things interesting tell you what else i like is your little note book love seeing you refer to that
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,thank you for the comprehensive video description i often check it to find additional info and find them lacking also thank you for properly using the time links for the chapters of the video and thank you for your wonderful wonderful videos
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,i wish manufacturers would share the charging curve maximum power input is about as useful as maximum power output
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,i want to replace my petrol citigo with the electric version but as you say finding one is like hens teeth this though makes me excited
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,lmao that power off sound is awful
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review jonny and love the car small point im pretty sure certain editions of the 500 come with 17 alloys as do most abarths some even have 18s üò±
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,looks pretty cool tbh had no idea they already made an electric 500
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,great video you missed the opportunity clich√© of going to electric avenue not a million miles from where you were
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,how jonny is continuing to put out this level of quality content each week is so impressive its so well thought out well shot and thats not a moments work dont forget to sleep jonny but stunning work
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,the first electric version came out only in the states on direct request of president obama to marchionne after the fiat and chrysler fusion it was put together very quick and probably not quite good this is a proper ev from top to bottomso its probably better no one could be able to buy it back in 2013cheers from italy
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,got my mg zs ev for 21500 how can these manufacturers justifie these prices
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,people will pay for style and this isnt exactly much differently priced
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,thomas shelbyyou need to be carrol shelby
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review and all credit to michael rockperring and inkshark studio some cracking good footage
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,this is the best review ive seen so informative the style and especially the range is a deal breaker for me but i would like to see a choice in style of the wheels as i dont like them cheers
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,the previous 500e was a compliance car made to be sold only in california because california mandated any manufacture must sell an ev if they want continue to sell their ice cars and california being one of the largest car markets in the world fca really had no choice
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,the citigo iv stopped at only 400 imported into the uk you can order a seat mii electric or vw eup
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,its not much of a jump up to a honda which means that you dont need to deal with the fca after sales service but then its not that much of a jump up from the honda to a tesla which gets you that charging network plus 400 km range which means its a complete petrol replacement not a second car if youre ok with the size of the tesla
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,whoever did your graphics should be praised very slick very clear very nice congrats
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,dear mister jonny i really like your reviews you put a lot of effort in it
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,to whoever its handling the video production and edit bravo
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice comprehensive review jonny is clearly one of the best car reviewers on youtube however i do think this video could easily have been wrapped up in 10 minutes instead of 19
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,dont get out those clothes youll upset your grandfather thomas shelby especially being in birmingham üòÇ im with you on this new fiat 500 e it is clearly italian styling and that colour of blue is just beautiful fit and finish and materials of the car look really well done not like some others in this category for this price and 199 miles range is really quite good i am with you though when it comes to honda e it just has that snippet that will draw everyone in and make them love it more and i would live with the range of 137 miles that means you charge it once or twice a week more which is peanuts compared to filling up with petrol our hydro in manitoba canada is the cheapest in north america hovering around 58 centskhr so this means the honda e will cost me an extra 34 a week to run you can barely buy a coffee at starbucks for that money and i know the honda e is a little more money and you get the honda quality and reliability which goes on for years it has more cool factor than the 500 e does the 500 e has more of that italian styling thing going on id still take the honda e rwd and snow tires itll be fine and it has its own form of traction control which will be good in our canadian winters great review mr shelby i am rebuilding a 2002 golf gls right now with really quite reasonable kilometres on it and the body is excellent shape so i have something to keep me busy this winter great video as usual jonny
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,so much more interesting than a normal boring review really created an atmosphere now the bar is set high for future themed reviews good luck and great work
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,im not kidding in san francisco last week a fiat 500 hit the back of a truck at least 810 mph and every air bag in the car went off the door air bags too but why the door bags it was right next to me the women couldnt find the door handle to get out thanks
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,every review of an ev talks about range a lot im so tired of even hearing about it i keep wanting a honda e despite the range then youre a fool if you dont own one mate you know what people dont talk about very much the actual range of ice cars i mean in a review of a new ice car some mention of the range for that particular car its very rare you know why because range doesnt really matter so much this clean technica article from 2016 said the median range for ice was 412 miles 50 of ice vehicles in 2016 got less than 412 miles on a tank remember back in 2016 when everyone was complaining about ice range me neither why did i link an article from way back in 2016 because i couldnt find a more recent article on the subject of ice range i just know that some ice muscle cars you know the ones competing for market share with model 3s and taycans and lucid airs have ranges under 200 miles lets rangeshame them range anxiety to me its range insanity wake up and smell the cheap abundant electricity everywhere httpscleantechnicacom20160826electricvehiclerangesexceedgasolinepoweredvehicleschart
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,those are some of the nicest wheels i have ever seen
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,what a shame the base model is priced well but only does about 10 miles real world range another swing and a miss üò≠
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,looks quite funky as a design appeal from the outside its definitely better than the honda
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,i must be one of the few people who really dont like the styling of the honda e i think the fiat is leaps and bounds better looking and the city model is significantly cheaper the mini although still a city car is a different type of car it is primarily about performance and luxury ranter than styling that isnt to say the mini isnt a good looking car too i would definitely have the fiat over the honda yet another great review
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,lovely clothes on you nice car review to
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review jonny and greetings from australia i would love to see this car here and punt it around orange nsw fca australia make me an offer i cant refuse
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,a fine channel that drives a further nail into old school tv while being old school thanks for cheering me up
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,the earlier 500e had a bosch drive system who does the new versions motor and electronics
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,johnny man what are you doing i love your videos but this one has too many adverts despite that adverts you have a way of making feel like ive driven that car when i clearly havent which is a testament to your skill
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,good homework the detailed information makes all the difference ive seen the other reviews and ive got the same opinion the honda e its the one although for fiat i reckon its a real grownup product very interesting for the price range and no doubt a competitive one to look for the italians just gave to the design that extra flare which makes it desirable
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,that looks bloody brilliant everything an electric car should be and needs to be perfect for the city interesting and cool
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,it looks promising but a its a fiat made by fiat chrysler group and b chrysler complete shiite we all know it if anyone can take promising and turn it into garbage its chrysler
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,jonny that was a brilliant review just what i want from a car programme keep up the great work mate
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the battery is to small period with an option of minuscule or outdated flagship smaller than a zoe is hard to justify if your outside a city commute
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review jonny love the new graphics as well detailed review and comparisons too love it
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,jonny you have never looked better than in that outfit honestly and i love this new ev 500 it gives hope to us all that the electric future isnt going to be bland and blobby but interesting and stylish great video
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,hard top fiat 500 has a 3rd door option it is a bit weird and i havent seen it yet but is only on one side
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,beautiful design details the italians know what theyre doing shades the honda by a mile
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i came here for car and i got history
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,congrats on over 200k subs johnny im super curious if you would do a review on your old killa drag car ev with how youve embraced evs i bet a throwback video of that little yellow beast could seriously increase viewership
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,many thanks i have considered it the car is no longer mine but i do have some home video shot during the build and early development of it that has never seen the light of day might use it
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow man i for one would seriously enjoy watching all of those clips thank you from one car nut to another for producing such truly high quality drama free pure carvana content üòé im putting the under on you getting to 1000000 subs by 2022 also would you consider doing something on the upcoming pure etcr electric racing series
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i like the designthumbs up
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,smashing review as always i was cracking up at the committed smoker
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,it is georgous and so is the car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review they put in a lot of effort
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,windows up smoking thats full commitment to the cause
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,its a good package dorian i was impressed priced pretty well i think
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,its also the only electric convertible on sale right now thatll get people interested
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,what car is used in the image at 1454 it has a rear hinged rear door
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,just watched bobbys review of this car on fully charged he likes it even more great honest review thanks
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,well done for changing the name of the channel this is more like it the review was great informative fun well laid out two thumbs up
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,why is it compulsory to have ugly wheels on an ev
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,it seems that way although i like the honda e gas hobs and mini e uk plugs
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow yeah fair points there though they seem to be the exceptions rather than the rule
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,nope no money to restore it yet so havent gone beyond getting brakes working and driving it back to my house sorry it will have to wait a bit longer
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i am not a fan of the production version of the honda e the boot of the fiat is a little small and wouldnt be the most practical choice even so i think it looks amazing inside and out and i would definitely consider the long range version
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,another great review jonny ill take it over the mini its better looking
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,very stylish very dapper car pretty good too
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,lovely to look at cute and stylish just like the previous model but has the same failure it is about as practical as a chocolate fireguard seats 4 but 2 can only be children and only 2 doors so access to rear is difficult eup and co have 5 doors more room and bigger boot not got the style or fashion appeal tho fiat really need a panda e to have a practical family city car now that would be an interesting and usable city runabout panda e 4x4 anyone
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,another excellent review and raised the bar with the production quality i used to watch fully charged but they are a joke compared to this channel
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,this is such a fantastic piece of design theyve really refined stephensons original and now it just looks spot on a very desirable little thing
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,it is a good looking car particularly in that colour
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,it makes no sense whatsoever but id still rather have the honda e thats exciting as i wasnt sure id ever say that about an electric car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,sorry this isnt very pc but the fiat 500 is a girls car if honda did its e with competitive range it would be a no brainer
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,a few days ago i did watch a 500e test by a german guy i do prefer the british style yours for example thank you gr√º√üe aus deutschland martin
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,really liked your take on how one could review a car jonny you are probably one of the best along side mr harris üòâ i have one request could you please add range info in km as well so that i we dont have recalculate all the numbers shown stay safe
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great video love the late brake show
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review as always and dressed up too this is now the go to channel for great entertaining history lesson ev reviews üòÄ
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,if i was looking for an ev this would be a strong contender nice wee thing btw jonny love the channel its brilliant and so look forward to watching it also like your particular style of presenting its so refreshing keep up the good work
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i had one of the original 500es glad you mentioned that one it was my firstever ev i leased one here in san diego from 2014 to 2017 for my 60mile roundtrip commute it was a really fun little car and with some creative packing could fit my entire drum set in the back leaving the passenger seat open i wish they added dc charging and more range over the years but they didnt seem interested ended up replacing it with an i3 and then a model 3 after that this looks like a perfect successor i kind of hope it makes it back here one day i might just have one in my driveway again
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i am begging fiat usa to sell this in the zev states here in usa im your first customer gordon from washington dc
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,honda e and mini are a failing ev both 2015 range well done fiat a winner in 42kw version some reason to buy smaller battery for some city dwellers
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i like the video production the car well knowing their history of of how well they dont hold up i hope they have upped the quality control i use to work at an auto auction in california saw a bunch of the original 500es come through and got auctioned off most only went for a few thousand dollars
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i vowed as a teenager that id never own another fiat after several painful years with my disastrous 124 sport coupe which was more rust than steel at the end my favorite part of the video is mendelssohns italian symphony which is so evocative and quietly reflective as nice as the car is ill take the symphony any day of the week jonny of course is excellent as always
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review congratulations on reaching 200k subscribers ive just become one of them
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,im interested in this i love the honda e but the specs for the price knocks it out of the consideration immediately turning on a dime isnt as useful as going 200 miles
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,that looks better than the mini electricthat is like a guccithe mini is like a levislol
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i prefer the lever type gear shifterpush forward if you want to go forwardand pull backward if you want to back upthat is easier and faster to do if you are trying to escape from something and want to move fast
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,this video was ridiculous so many things i love birmingham peaky blinders cinquecento italy evs late break show of course proper job
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,top quality material as usual from jonny one of the most honest car journalists
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,beautifully filmed plenty of comparison data excellent if living in a city with a 5 mile commute then more than a weeks worth of range in the city version
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,winter range will be less batteries dont like the cold
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,so good review
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,really like how your videos and style are evolving keep the upward trajectory going
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,still 30k for a top spec tiny fiat
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,wow what a great video im actually taken aback by how much i enjoyed this a proper review too graphics content delivery the whole deal is great compared to other car review channels this is above and way beyond but then again the late brake show is in a league of its own following you since fifth gear johnny top job keep it up love from pakistan
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,even for a fiat 500 this thing is ugly
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,that door motor is noisey as fuck not ideal for doing back alley sov ring man type jobs you aint seen me right
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,made me smile u saying eup in that hat with that scenery and the music
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,what an excellent video jonny nice car too im not sure why ive a draw towards the mini e though even though its an old shape now and hasnt a fantastic range
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review however i cant quite understand what is the view looking at the rear seats 1455 looks like a suicide door as its not the car in the test
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,im glad to see that im not the only one who likes the crz its an underappreciated gem in my opinion id love an electric version of it if it wasnt so expensive id look at getting one converted
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,an electric car from a nation thats regarded to produce the worst automotive electrics for the sake of the future owners i hope its not a case of the usual italian automotive electrics
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,there is not a huge difference in price compared to the id3 with the small battery the 500e is not a cheapo but looks really good i would like to have this as a rental when arriving somewhere with the train or plane with the big battery for the city it is really fine and attractive i did not expect to see such a nice car coming from fiat
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,this has the benefit that its based on a piston fiat 500 while the honda e is a brand new car its good competition but if i had the choice id get the honda e still well presented review and thanks so much for the timestamps
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the late brake show jonny can you explain why subsequent generations of car are always slightly bigger than the car they replace it seems to have been going on for as long as i can remember eventually cars seem to shift up a category and the a new small car is introduced to fill the gap is that an intentional strategy i dont get it
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,beautiful short film and beautifully produced a new late brake show video is always first on the list
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,fantastic review jonny
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,really enjoyable review what would be a peaky blinder car colorinterior combo
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,try twingo electric and compare
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,excellent review johnny going from strength to strength
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i like that good to see ashton engineering sign still up that was the place for su carbs
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,my god im 62 years old and hardly remember su also amal carbs on bsatriumph bikes
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thanks jonny a sane nonhysterical review i am in thailand so we have to wait but my original fiats were cars to love this might just be the e car for me
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,range range range got any spare change
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice review nice car very nice looking car nice music choice too quality job again if i missed peaky blinder refs sorry i didnt watch it
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice looking car and nicely filmed too
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,really enjoy your vt and like the car can see it parked bumper to bumper in a roma street covered in tree sap
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,one add fine two ok but four jonny might not have any say in how many adds but if you do id watch that personally ive unsubscribed because of such last was a 9 minute clip with five breaks and that was enough to think yeah click great wee car it needs a sport mode surly just for that ten to twenty miles of twisty roads every so often to keep the car interesting couldnt buy it still on range as we do road trips and holidays honda e and mini se would be on the drive if it did 200300 miles real world getting there but will a tesla two door compact be a game changer in the segment in a few years
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,dont we already have fully charged for all those ev fetishists
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,look back at my videos there are ev classic piston modified and car stories this is not pure ev
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow i know mate i really enjoy all those episodes i just feel like this ev thing is getting shoved down my throat and i appreciate that this is probably going to be the near future for motoring perhaps im just a dinosaur and my extinction is just around the corner
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,that turin cityscape and old 500 drawing are very chrysler easter egg
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,whilst im yet to be convinced the e is anywhere as green as the man would have us believe i much prefer these to sticking ev in classics its going to be interesting to see how the economy copes with the loss of the ice and all the associated people parts enthusiasts modifiers racers etc etc when they try and ban fossil fuels
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,best one yet outstanding review
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,in 2022 ill get one hopefully prices drop a bit by then
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice more choice is always good preetty car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,very nice and informative video thanks a lot first one of your channel i watched what i was wondering about what does this car sound like if youre outside of it lets say if youre a pedestrian and this car is zooming by what do you hear only the tires or more dont know how you would objectively need to measure it but id be curious to know not just for this car but for every ev youll test if in the future all cars are electric the roads will probably be quiet and because of that dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists oh and what does it sound like when youre inside the car greetings from holland rob
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i still cant understand why all evs are one pedal and why they dont just stop completely when you lift off it takes all of about 3 minutes to get used to this and its ime totally intuitive press more to go faster lift more to slow down stay the same to go the same speed simple easy intuitive anything else paddles modes or god forbid having to press the brake pedal to regen is just stupid imo ive driven an i3 for 5 years now and iev used the actual brake pedal ooh about twice in all that time
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,some beautiful filming here making use of that harsh morning light especially that early scene as jonny drives through that tall archway a tv advert quality shot fratello signor rockperring this 500ev is going to sell like espressos on a cold morning quite deservedly too interesting competitors each really reflecting its country of origin i think good work all round late brakers
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,electric and any italian cars dont mix
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,am i the only one that thinks the face is very feminine thebad boy bonnet serves to give the lights eyelashes and the lower grille creates a cute little smile all in all and whichever way it appears to the onlooker i think fiat got it just right
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,excellent honest review jonny
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,hi jon great car have the petrol version tell me please what watch are you wearing in this video thanks wayne
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,if abarth get their hands on it i may just have to get my first ev üò¨
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i dont know who filmed this for you but i have to say that was a superb piece of work being fairly local it was strange seeing a review set in digbeth but it was excellent the car look great too
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,much as i enjoy rob llewellyn im pleased to watch a full review of the new 500e as a current 500c driver im really interested to see if this is a tenable replacement for the petrol car im not surprised you struggled to reach a conclusion youre not the target audience
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,a beautiful looking car fiat have done an excellent job good rival to the honda e but not quite as much power better range but do you need that every day unlikely
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review dark but delightful sadly we will not get these cars here in s africa
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,as an american that owned one of these in this same color lol i am absolutely devastated they arent coming to the us i was prepared to buy another one and that dream was killed so quick
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the quality of your videos is so good your genuine passion and knowledge about cars really shines trough humble and personable too cant belive your not sponsored yet
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,it would be interesting to see this car compared to the new twingo the twingo is not as posh as the 500 but size and range seems comparable to the range of the cheaper one
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,hey car pervert which one of your parents was the meerkat
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,you win robert is the man but this review is better
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review of the car but an italian car so lets make a connection with peaky blinders and gangster and mafia really again i am very tired of this attitude
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,im a current first gen owner and love it as my commuter this new gen is perfect with the better range would allow travel round trip to many locations without recharge i really hope they change their mind and bring it to the states or at least to california
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i think that looks fantastic great view as always jonny never seen digbeth so quiet
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,what a charming little thing i think this size is perfect for ev adoption as youve said jonny hope to see these out and about
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,love it i am little sad they made it so much larger in all dimensions but it is still beautiful for a city driving it is a great car one thing i would go for is a two tone paintjob that makes it even better looking i would get this over the honda e every day btw recommend trying their vr configurator quite a well made thing httpswwwfiatcom500electricvirtual3dexperience
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice review mate we need more entry level evs with good range and less extras that a lot of people dont need or want
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,such a better car review than other rival gangsahemfcahem nuff said
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,loved the you aint seen me car looks ok as well
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,its ok but isnt the most unreliable thing about italian cars the electrics they dont do that great on petrol either haha at least it will get up hills because apparently the 500 gearboxes had issues with that i think honda is more huggable would get more attention for the xtra money and will probably last a lot longer
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i think theyve done a great job with the design and some really interesting colours itll do well
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice reviewis the 42 kwh gross or net
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the fiat to me is more stylish than the honda which seems to be one of those quirky japanese designs aimed at their home market
2021-06-24,JSwvQE0tgyM,but fiat is italy and therefore eu based and honda is japanese and therefore not eu based
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i was always so against evs as a die hard petrol head until about 6 months ago when i discovered your channel johnny i honestly believe the future wont be as bad as we think it will be for us petrol heads and when 2030 comes there will still be interesting cars on sale
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,sorry but were you a fully charged employee same old story
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,848 jonny go pop round to rg at bicester heritage they supplied some of the cars for the filming
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,if we start a petition to get jonny sponsorship and just over half the people who watch this channel sign it they have to debate it in parliament that will get some attention dont you think come on people in fact i will i just started it click the link to sign the petition httpspetitionparliamentukpetitions562716sponsorsnewtokenjv0l0n3xdg1sjywg_du0 getjonnyasponser
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow no worries made me cackle thinking of them actually having to debate it at 10k we get a response from the government kind of hoping it gets that far now just to see what they say
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,another nice vlog with great camera work imagery and soundmusic love your honest reviews pointing out all the good and bad and even what other cars are better choices have better options and prices love the looks of the 500e and the slightly larger dimensions and wheels actually not a bad look for you as well with your outfit cool little touch with the way they integrated the e inside the 0 of the 500 nice interior the center display didnt look like some slapped on ipad like some other vehicles and the built in wireless phone chargers are nice sounded like it had a really nice quite interior good soundproofing and the motor didnt sound whiny or droning inside the cab while you were talking or as it was driving by on the exterior shots only 4 things i could pick out that i didnt like were 1 the musical startstop is a cute touch that could be fun to show off but i imagine after hearing it dozens and dozens of times it could get annoying 2 i wish the roof would tuck down further for better rear visibility 3 dont like the location of the switches in the center console because they seem like they could be accidentally hit easily 4 really dont like the electric door releases if you have an electrical problem how do you open the door break a window to get out i prefer a hard connection with a normal cable latch because even if the handle or cable broke both doors wouldnt be broken at the same time the way electrically operated doors could be and you could climb across to use the other door when every single thing is electrically operated on an electric car it starts to seem gimmicky and unnecessary and just an extra power drain on the battery even if its just a tiny fraction of power that it uses ditch power door handles get rid of touch screen digital controls for the radio leave the connections on the steering wheel for safety not having to move your hands and eyes leave the climate controls as dials and switches or levers and no power operated steering column adjustments that add heavy motors that all being said its still a really nice car that i would buybut probably look for someone to modify the doors to some standard fiat door handles
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,nicely done the hondae would get a lot more attention from me if the range was better but for that marque ill hold out for an r spec version with over 250 miles in the meantime this will fill the bill nicely as a runabout
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,well done jonny masterful review with some nice social history thrown in well doen fca too only slightly disappointed that the sherpa setting doesnt enable everest ascents
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,if fca group ever manage to seeing their way to pricing this 15000 after incentives i think it would fly out of the showrooms great little car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,lovely how the honda e keeps coming up in this review if honda really wanted to sell it they wouldnt have put in it the smallest battery they could find
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thank you for creating this content johnny your enthusiasm for evs is infectious
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the seat mii is the vw eup with a different badge
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,everything is ev or ev conversion on this shitty show un subbed
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i dont like new cars im not in a position to purchase any of the cars but i still sit and watch jonnys reviews the best real life car content maker on youtube in my opinion keep the vids coming
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,that headlight design may well be my favourite ever overall the best looking car ive seen in decades great video jonny
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the 2 battery options is exactly what honda should have done with the e
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,20 000 for a small car like that with a pointless back seat and getting less than 115 miles range is a mockery surely youre better of with a reno zoe
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,french and italian cars have always had a bad reputation for poor electrical reliability can you imagine having a pure ev
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i think it looks awesome but id rather have the honda e for the price
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,ive got the previous generations ev us spec its honestly a fantastic little car it was my gateway drug to evs ive got 3 evs now 500e i3s ipace i still love driving the fiat its just so simple approachable for any driver a quick around town fun little car to mod too ive been slowly turning it into my silent abarth
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the driver of the crz has his windows up because he doesnt want anyone to smell his rollup
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review johnny awesome car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,typical ialian flair good range as well could see myself buying one of these you hit it on the head when you said it would attract people who wouldnt normally consider electric i put myself in that category the only downside is italian vehicle electrics reputation
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,another great video jonny thank you stumbled across your channel a couple of weeks back and what a treat its been takes me back to the early days of fifth gearbut with electricity professional informative and entertaining a lot of your fellow youtubers would do well to watch and learn keep up the awesome work
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,what an amazing little ev great very informative review have to admit that i just watched fully charged show 500e review and have to say i am a bit disappointed as much as like like robert you gave me all the information i wanted to know plus more absolutely amazing johnny
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the fact that its electric is excellent otherwise a hateful and contrived crock of shit upvote for the video and the brilliant production and presentation
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,interesting that the long range pack runs at lower voltage i suppose thats a compromise you have to make when youve got a cell you want to use and precious little extra space to stick them
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,this is the best electric small car dont understand why people get excited by the honda fiat is cute but also smart looking minino thanks
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the b pilar looks like an audi a2 do city cars make sense though the aim is to reduce vehicle congestion in cities
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,class video i recognize some of those streets there is a electric go karting place there somewhere
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,love the themed review much more interesting than a run of the mill style review video
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,designed by fiat as an electric vehicle but they still fit it with a button labelled engine start stop and theres all that space under the bonnet where the charging cables could be stored but fiat supply a hand bag to keep the charge cable in the already small boot
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i have morale issues perhaps you guys can help me with that the rational father in me says dont mess up the planet for your son buy an ev the kid in me says go fu off with that crap lets have fun and buy that gr yaris what do you guys say when hearing that
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice looking car but a 3 door car in this day and agethink a 4 door version would appeal more
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,bizarre just watched matt watson and now i am seeing digbeth will dmo deejay be drag racing this car and then fighting llf in his mini e for a truly brummie take on evs
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,im not even in the market for an ev and wanted to see this was a fun watch d
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,why do manufacturers make things complicated al those charging options why not just plug it in and unplug it when one needs to go it will have taken a charge the amount dependent on the time plugged in just like ones phone or laptop have they forgotten the kiss principle
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,lol did the car pervert channel get taken down this is a much better name no doubt
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,sorry to go full ev nerd but i think you said it has an 11kw onboard charger but it looks like a single phase type2 when you opened the filler flap which would mean only 72kw capable have they dropped 3phase for the uk model this is something other manufacturers have done as its comparatively rare over here
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the only way to get out of the back of my 500c is to open the roof and step out over the boot but its a great little car shame its twice the price of the petrol original presumably as batteries improve it will come down haha gotta love a cheekycento im keeping that
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,once again we have got to put up up with stupidly oversize wheels on what is basically a city car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice looking little car the presenter was ok too
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i just love the fact that its an italian car thats actually made in italy
2024-01-23,JSwvQE0tgyM,superta7it is made in italy though the previous 500 was made in poland but this one is made in turin
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,looking smart the car is good too
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the colours have a special shine and all are beautiful i had a 500c before with a socalled robotic auto transmission and that was awful this new electric one really changed my perception of the 500 but still i am not sure if i want this fake type of convertible roof
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,weve owned a 500 l for several years great car totally reliable however substantially bigger than the 500 proper rear legroom and a big spacious hatch which holds loads of stuff this is too small from the front seats back lovely design though just needs an l
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,production quality smart idea proven korean know how classy italian styling could be a veritable ev 2021 lease hit this 500 e thank you
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,now give us a 124 electric please
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i cant explain itthe honda makes me want to touch and drive it
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,car is an absolute stunner great video
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,didnt expect the look of a fiat 500 to be more fresh than that of a mini and the honda e for me was a disappointment when the design study was so much stronger than the final product the sunroof is a winner for a city car and since almost no one needs 3 seats in this market id put my order on a 500
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,was this review done on a saturday or sunday morning
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,noted the fully charged review of the same car at the same time love the fully charged channel and robert but jonny owned the car review element and still does
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,that was bloody good quality video again dont suppose you could do one everyday could you üòú
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,if theyd fitted sensiblysized wheels the smaller wheel wells would have facilitated better legroom and a larger battery form above functionnn
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,err this isnt realistic is it they dont go all out to put more batteries in evs its a balance between weight price range and performance and looks
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,best review online jonny love the onscreen info panels also the range comparison with the rival cars makes loads on sense
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,its a nice and little cute car until you see it parked near a 4 door sedan and realize its higher and fatter and not little at all
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,a nice thorough review johnny i am disappointed that city cars get bigger all the time id like to see a comparative review of tiny electric cars like the smart etc
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,this makes so much sense as an ev relatively affordable stylish and desirable with a range better than decentlovely
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,at 40k its not affordable at all its another toy and status symbol prop get an opel corsa for 20k fun and range included
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,lonewolfwp9dn actually in italy the price now starts from 16000 with government incentives and i know that in uk fiat 500e will costs starting from 22
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,piergentililuca2905 how can there be such a huge difference what is the government incentive there 20k any way the top models do go to 40k euros its ridiculous for such a small car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,piergentililuca2905 its just under 20000 i believe for the base model with the government grant
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,davidholden2658 its 10k most other places and 7500 in the uk
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,lonewolfwp9dn what is 7500 in the uk
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,davidholden2658 i just looked it up in the uk the incentive is 8000 pounds thats 8800 euros
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,lonewolfwp9dn no the uk grant is 3000 i dont think its ever been as high as 8000 httpswwwgovukplugincarvangrants
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,davidholden2658 right it used to be 4500 and they cut it its 8k for vans i think for normal cars it used to be higher
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,davidholden2658 there is no such thing as government grants only other peoples money
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,davidholden2658 i like electric cars but at this price and range this is a perfect advertisement for petrol powered cars
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,jamescaley9942 the range is fine for a city car and its only 6000 more than the standard hybrid version with much lower running costs
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,davidholden2658 i was comparing with the 12 petrol much less complicated than the hybrid far superior range than the ev and closer to half the price of the cheapest ev one problem with small battery evs is they will need more charge cycles and that will also reduce battery life and the range is already short true performance will not be as good but this is the budget car class
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,the panda was always the affordable choice not the 500 mkii and further the 500 is a style icon and has also the overpriced style price so now we have to wait how the bread and butter version the panda will do the merger of psa en fca has been aproved so the 500e platform could be used on other small and compact electric cars opelvauxhall karlcorsa citro√´n c1c3 peugeot 108208 fiat pandapunto and a small chrysler dodge for the us market
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,relatively affordable 40k for a class b car is not affordadle petrol version is like 15k
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,paulomoniz7326 not affordable when you consider the model for selling new cars is the equivalent of taking a mortgage out on a house guaranteed to collapse in value it is a niche for the well of or multicar households and why should tax payers subsidise new car purchases when we cannot even do the same for higher education
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,and spend hours charging it up meanwhile it takes 5 minutes to fill my turbo petrol car up im not against evs but i wont get one until they are a practical direct replacement for diesel and petrol cars same range including winter and same time to charge as filling a tank
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,piergentililuca2905 i am kind of surprised italy feels like paying for your cars
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,tomasmalin go to check it in italy the total discount can reach 10500 with government incentives 6400 scrapping up to 4000 and fiat discounts and i would like to remind you that now euro has more value than pound its one of the reason why you pay more and thats just because of your brexit
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,r3tr0v1ru5 i dont know in uk but in italy and others eu countries an used tesla that costs 20k do not exist ive just checked if it exists its a car ready for the rubbish
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,r3tr0v1ru5 check this video it shows all the costs of fiat 500e in italy and it has english subtitles httpsyoutubex5nbfeoydzu
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,lonewolfwp9dn check this video it shows all the costs of fiat 500e in italy and it has english subtitles httpsyoutubex5nbfeoydzu
2021-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,guys i got 500e icon berlina for 19k with ocean green color comfort pack and wallbox we had incentives from government end region my one was 34k
2022-04-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,lone wolf where tf did you get 40k it starts around 25k that extremely affordable for an ev with this amount of tech and range
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,hi great videoabout the car it uses samsung liquid cooled battery packhow does it compare to the previous one used on the first 500e in californiabattery degradation is my concerntesla have really worked it out i am far from comparing the two cars but i would really luv it if fiat have stepped forward

2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,if you take that simplistic a view of things youll never buy anything
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,what a great review the style you tried to pull off really worked in my opinion
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,but it is the only ev cab out there right
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,as said below in previous comment this is a really excellent channel and so professionally executed with great in depth reviews by a true and knowledgeable professional very enjoyable to watch well done jonny keep em coming although i dont have one at the moment like many others ive always admired the style the fiat 500 and have seriously considered getting one now after seeing this i am really am interested in the new ev and now have the information i need for a informed decision
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,cheers jonny another top notch videoreview best of luck getting a sponsor or several for the channel quality should be rewarded
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,well done great reviewthank god for you tube your style is starting to shinejust follow your instinctpeaky blinders whatever next
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review and entertaining video and ive never watched peaky blinders
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,excelling in the production levels jonny doffs cap makes it a joy to watch and take in the full review of the car keep it up
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,looks like an opel adam and an audi a1 had an evil baby the headlights are a mistake in my book dont like it and i think we have seen more than enough evil looking front ends the honda e is much more likeable to me
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,bear with typically there is a classic vid of some sort every month
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i watched back to back the late brake fully charged reviews of the 500e jonny you get the thumbs up from me more real life detail excellently put across in a blinding manner
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,to be honest im not even sure i want to watch fc review now that ive seen this one is fc review full of roberts sound impressions and rants range and let me guess unnecessary comparison to tesla
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,excellent piece v professional finally fiat have got their badge right oh the watch ruins the look jonny mi old son
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i just love your reviews segments on evs your so stylish too you could totally pull off a scene in peeky blinder tooi continue to wish the 500e comes to the states i own a fiat 500c lounge a 500x trekking plus get so many compliments on the c everywhere great job on the review of this beautiful city ev
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i live in oregon usa and have one of the original es love the car it does exactly what it was designed for commuter but i would absolutely buy one of these with the longer range with the longer range i could realistically drive to and foe airport in winter at freeway speeds without recharging so the big question of the day from us yanks is will it be coming states side
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,hands down the best motoring journalist on the scene at the moment not monitoring hahah johnnys style of presenting is a great mix between facts and quirky banter keep up the great work late brake show
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow hahaha oh and motoring i blame iphone it did it again damn it
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review and i think a fantastic looking car fiat have really got their act together for this one and brave to ditch replacing the current car with another pistonengined one just go entirely ev and accept its the future even if the sales for the next few years might not be great
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,love the crisp graphics plus the smoothness of the review
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,is this channel the best up and coming car review channel yes it is
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,ive been driving a 2013 fiat 500e for several years now california compliance car have always loved it looks like fiat brought across all the best bits and made it better
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the late brake show
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,enjoy the vid my wife loves the fiat 500 what i want to know is where did you get the coat or what the brand and name is my son already wears the cap but we havent found a coat that would suit him until now
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow thank you your outfit proper suited you my son is of similar build so will work fine hes tried the trench coats which look good on him but sometimes it wasnt practical or got in the way and is now collecting dust yours looks more user friendly of to find it now thanx again
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,electric door openers im out dont even understand how that can be legal yes i am aware that other cars have it too
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,think it looks fantastic it will sell well its the transition car we need for ev adoption can i also add what a fantastic approach to the review tasteful and so different to everything out there which makes it all the more digestible keep it up
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great little car would love one great original presentation
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,small point could you please refer to level 2 adas as driver assistance or similar its not autonomous if it cant drive itself without you needing to take over lv2 constantly requires the driver to be alert and ready to retake control theres a lot of false advertising and undue trust around this tech at the moment and its an important distinction to make
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i think there is only jonny and harry metcalfe doing genuinely original well considered and well produced car content on youtube jonny seems to have found his feet with his channel always good to watch
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,love the review love the setting top marks all round
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,another great video jonny well done i saw on the charts showing recharge times there were these pie charts with clocks on them im not sure what they were trying to show just some feedback thanks again for the great episode
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,not a car for me personally but its nice to see the ev push from old auto manufacturers continue that honda has so much potential why is it being so underkitted a bigger battery pack and a slightly perkier motor and that thing would be 2021 version the 2007 fiat 500
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,jonny fantastic review youve got great charisma and your transition from tv to internet media really shows how great of a car journalist you can be really hope you can get a few sponsors on board shortly you really deserve it i love this channel
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,lovely car and video the fact it has sherpa mode means fiat recognises the ev infrastructure is shyte and will be for years and years to come
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,love the outfit like your namesake vegas on taskmaster üòÇ anyway cute car the 500 will always have that i want a cute 2nd car appeal for me its the 500 or the twingo and nothing comes close lookswise to them
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,its wonderful that you noticed bruce weve tried really hard to raise the bar during this year and its great to hear positive feedback
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow aw cheers for the reply johnny üòÄ all your content is ace but this latest one really shone for me sponsor imminent surely
2021-01-11,JSwvQE0tgyM,yes exactly i thought about this all the time first location very nice shooting very nice seen locations and at all moments very good job sound has improved a lot jonny image quality also did overall the whole picture and scenery has been great good job team
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,out of my price range never own one in my lifetime because these things seem to be for the idle rich
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i watched car wow and fully chrged review of this car yours is best and loved ur dress
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review i love the story aspect theres enough detail for us geeks and it gives a good impression of what the car is capable of i dont really understand what has happened to small evs over the last few years though the new ones mini honda fiat even the peugeotvauxhall offer numbers similar to a zoe from 3 years ago ok with a little faster charging but for significantly more money they seem to be trying to justify that with styling and tech but it feels like its back to front make a really good platform epanda and then put the premium styledfeatured car at the top of the range for those who care about that sort of thing the zoe is a 10 year old design and thanks to the battery and tech upgrades and ccs its still the best everyday car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,excellent review and fun as well top work again jonny
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,imagine one day youve messed upyoure driving your 500 ev home on a cold night in sherpa mode but its not enoughthe battery diesbllocks you think to yourself you get out the car on your mobile phone to the rac whilst you grab your bag out the boot you pull the door handle to get back in and the electric touch sensor button doesnt work the boots the same and the keyless fob is insidepoppyck sorry it just bugs me that everything is going electric buttons and screens these days üòÇi miss old cars and their manual ways
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,are you still using miles were not in us
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,500e is so sexy
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thanks for not saying car pervert at the start of the video going to show this review to my mum and that cuts out a bit of explaining üòÇ
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,did i hear you say type 1 plug is this maybe some early prototype or for another market on the fiat site it all refers to type 2 plugs
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,wow fiat have put a lot of effort into this car i really like it
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,what car is that male supermodel reviewing great work cheeky blinder
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,where are you going to charge it in a city and driving in the city is the most uneconomical way of driving
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thats a truly sexy car and thats a proper gentleman style johnny hats off to both fiat and your stylist
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i could of shown you all the great sites to eat in digbeth oh well next time call me
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,im not sure i should say this publicly but im kinda addicted to the tlbs i wasnt even thinking ev until i started watching these excellent reviews so that must be a good thing i do want to know however how many watches does jonny have
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,makes you wonder why renault dont just put the zoes internals in an attractive body it would attract so many more customers a modern version of the renault 5 would be great
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,sharp dressed man in spunky little car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,1345 ive never understood the point of this you still open the door yourself and you still pullpush a handle or button why is it electronic
2021-02-06,JSwvQE0tgyM,cost the only reason a car manufacturer does anything
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,although evs continue to interest me we still need them to be doing 500 miles on a charge before they can pull me out of my hybrid lexus
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,bringing your review 6 hours after fullycharged and hitting it out the ballpark hats off johnny
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,just saw an alternative review of this car and it was a dogs dinner you have made a superb job of yours congratulations and thank you
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,your videos get better and better i love it but too small for our family boot and rear seat access yoga hope they produce a giardinetta it wont look as cute but id buy a stretched 500 ev that doesnt look like a 500l ill sign up as a ptreon i hate the marketing abuse of english
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,still dont like electric above petrol but if we have to then it definitely will be this one üòç
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice review and actually a lovely looking little thing especially in that colour and trim that is going to do very well most of the people who buy it will just buy one because of the looks
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,jonny taking it to the next level very nice production quality
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,italian electronics control entering and exiting your fiat 500 that will end well üòÇ
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,1300 long range got 427kwh damn son im sold i can do a trip across europe
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,fiat 500 petrol 11 000 fiat 500 ev 23 000 3500 gov grant 26 500 battery cost for 42 kwh 42 x 120 5040 car should cost 11 000 battery price gove grant 12 500 overpriced enthusiast tax over 10 000 when are we going to start calling out this inflating of prices yes i know its higher trim than the 11 000 petrol version but it doesnt matter when there is no low ev trims available i know rd cost but car relies on already establish platforms also petrol cars also have rd cost this car should be no more than 14 000 after grants we cant be telling people that somehow we will get price party once battery cost drops below 100 we are only 20 away from that 20 reduction in cost will not reduce car price by 10 000 all evidence suggests manufacturers will try to us ev revolution as chance to increase their margins
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i prefer this to the honda e the range is a big big factor after a few years the range of the honda could be less than 100 miles thats simply not good enough considering the price what we really want is the zoe but designed by honda or fiat
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,apart from the car info thanks also for the history lesson
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i really like the colours they chose for this new model i would love a dark green with the same tone
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,this one will probably also sell better 2nd hand than the honda e so all in all it seems to make more sense i wish there was a bigger battery option for the honda it would make decisions so much easier
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,looks great and a brilliant review
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the first of your reviews that i have seen as a prospective ev purchaser albeit maybe not a new car i found the review informative interesting and unbiased as they should be well done i like the car also
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i hate to admit it but i like this new direction for the 500 if the long range can get anywhere near its claimed 199 mile range i think that will be brilliant along with the new corsa e these two manufacturers are actually doing things right and thinking about the bigger picture with a good amount of range unlike these other companies that are bringing out small cars in 2020 that have a claimed range of 100 which in real life is about 7080thats not acceptable imo and limits the overall amount of people that will actually buy one nice video mate
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,another superb feature jonny excellent production values looks fabulous never see enough of lingotto and thanks for setting it in my favourite city
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,im kind of astonished what a fantastic job theyve done on this especially the powertrain and the pricing a properly usable ev for 20k with more range than the 30k leaf of 5 years ago and nearly 200 miles with 85kw charging for 235k thats at the low end of golf pricing and gives some minigunlevel ammunition against the gripe that evs are too expensive particularly surprising that this is coming from fiat they dont have much pedigree with evs if i remember rightly the original 500e compliance car had the powertrain design and engineering done by a third party its also the company formerly headed by famously antiev sergio marchionne who once requested that customers not buy the original 500e the new car is a genuine milestone and its come from a really surprising place
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the alloy wheel design is very stylish like the wrap of materials over the binnacle seats are great nice music and production
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,really good informative review
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,seems to me that range mode would actually reduce your range the regen all the time is less efficient than planning ahead and coasting to a stop without regen
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review as usual with jonny at his best still dont get 17 inch wheels on a city car which lower the range and worsen the ride the door handles dont bode well for the future when the italian electrics take over i have owned a crz for the last 5 years and can confirm that it is brilliant and will only sell when the honda e prices are affordable second hand
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,very nice now i really want a panda 4x4 electric
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i think you suit the peaky look jonny also the 500e is the first of the new 500s i wouldnt absolutely run a mile from i like the new styling as you say less cutesy perhaps more resting btch face
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,you caught the surfacing and reflections beautifully in the low sun theyve really got the colour right though id like the armani paint job too
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,this was an unbelievably lame video concept idea i absolutely love it never stopx
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,that is a nice little car not sure why the 500s are quite popular in australia so it will be interesting to see how this goes when it gets here
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,they are cheap to buy and run and great fun an ev version should be even better
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,looks so much better than the mini really nice looking and that blue looks a bit like the alfa gabbiano blur colour lovely
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,it looks like a bamix machine for kitchen use i wouldnt drive that thing if i was paid
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i guess in a few years someone will put a regular fire breathing engine in it or at least thats what im hoping will happen
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,to think i go on drives through digbeth in my old mini nice to see the area get some screen time
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i saw one of the california only 500s at ikea in the algarve last week still had the california plate fixed underneath its new portuguese plate dragged my partner across the car park to show her something unique and rare that she wouldnt appreciate shes used to it now
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i saw one of the california only 500s at ikea in the algarve last week still had the california plate fixed underneath its new portuguese plate dragged my partner across the car park to show her something unique and rare that she wouldnt appreciate shes used to it now
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,fiat always smash it with styling love my abarth 124 spider
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,hi johnny its actually a really good verdict in the sense it as you said gives you more choice which can only be a good thing what is needed now with each of these cars dealerships is to get them on there loan fleet so when you take your piston engine car in for service you get to drive one without any sales pressure and i am sure more people would consider one once they have tried one
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,for me its definately the most exciting car in its class just ahead of the honda e with range being the big plus for the 500 as a very straight man id actually love one for city driving
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the ncap rating in 2017 was three stars even a smart fortwo scores four back in 2007
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,smarts are some of the safest cars on the road when i tell people that they never believe me
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,price jonny price jonny price jonny price jonny ffs 10 minutes in üôÑ good review tho glad youve dropped the aka car pervert nice fast show reference too
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow yes dear but when youre putting stats on screen for city and long range price should be one of them x
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,nickprice3605 ill add the price for nick price sooner on the next video sorry nick price price
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,they have really nailed this one well done fiat
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,its amazing what a car company can do when an old fart never electric dies
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,this is just like the honda e a car that appeals to you because of its styling although im not sure about the fascia i like the 2007 fascia of the 500 better rationally speaking it probably wouldnt be an option but humans arent rational
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,cant see me getting a ev am 33 years old grow up wanting performance and a car it sounds like one these are boring
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,another good review by our very own car expert jonny smith unfortunately i will not be buying an electric car anytime soon cos i live on a island i could not tell you where the hell is any car charging points saying that when we do finally catch up with the rest of the country then i would certainly be looking at purchasing a fiat 500
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,when fca commits to building something proper they can deliver something truly interesting and good looking just wish they would do it more often maybe they should look at jonny for some inspiration his commitment results in something that is interesting different and goodlooking maybe they need some car pervert espresso cups
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,an electric car made in italy thatll work well
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,sergio marchionne never would have let this car happen his passing enabled fiat to begin bringing italian style to evs hopefully something similar is in development for the chrysler side of fca
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,if ever a car had to be ev its a 500 love the design sorprendente just like the video and editing jonny im loving the reviews on evs as its something i will look to get in a few years my only concern is will the charge on these cars diminish similar to my mobile laptop tablet after a years worth of charging
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,good question ev batteries have a lot more systems in place such as clever heat management to protect them from degradation unlike laptop and phone batteries i would suggest watching a video or two from plug life tv the excellent euan mcturk explains this is detail httpsyoutubeqrpze4f0gsq
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,marktaylorhankins9398 thanks just watched that now and hes helped to dispel a lot of the gumf ive heard of regarding charging and battery lifespans
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,20 grand for a 200 mile electric city car with a second slower 060 will this be our midlife crisis car on finance when were all single virgins and stuck in our pod share with 12 other sweaty ev car owners in central london probably
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great technical review this is why we watch you jonny watched another review from a wellknown channel just before this hands down this is the more informative review
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,id pick the 500e over any electric car he mentioned for one simple reason its italian
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,elukok i see it as an absolute win
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,a great review looks great funny and informative b i love that you basically called this the impossible burger of small cars c no mention of the electric corsa the comparison charts were great id love to have those for more categories
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,hi roy great observations corsa yes of course and c4e i am yet to review these cars properly but they are definite considerations albeit a larger segment car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow ohohoho i didnt realize there was a c4e as well this is such a fun segment right now manufacturers are really trying stuff out and some of it is so weird and cool
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow nono you were already going for the peaky blinders thing which was brilliant and we shouldnt mix metaphors
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,robert wont appreciate me saying this jonny but your review is way more in depth and a much better review this looks like a very well thought out car whenever i here the word sherpa i think of the old van too üòÑ i must say the headlight design is bloody lovely
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i loved the 500 when it was reborn ive always liked it as it never had a redesign that was major i dont like this one though
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,in general the aesthetics is somewhat debatable it depends on the taste of each one it may be that in the honda you find very advanced engineering or in renault a very practical and spacious car however so far i have not seen another electric car that removes that air of an electric vehicle lacking in grace and style as if it had been made by a computer manufacturer the only fiat 500 rival that strays from that concept of hardware on wheels is the mini but the mini lacks the flair of italian designers renowned throughout the world we are talking about a beautiful design reminiscent of its past something that mini lost but according to what is required from now on beautiful car ahhh and the melody of fellinis dolce vitta is an insurmountable touch when starting the vehicle transports you to italy after wwii
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,jonny my boy you did it music camera whole style this is really good cinema and the car is also nice
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review dude soo much better than roberts on fully chargedüò≤ car is still too small effectively its a 2 seater or at best a 22 surprised you didnt make more of that in the vid seems very important to me
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,terrific vid stunning car it makes the mini look at least 3 years old and outdated rather than 3 months and whilst the honda e is a charming work of genius its flawed and expensive this is neither car of the year for me by a huge margin cheers
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,at least the top of the range model has a decent range jonny your ex fully charged partner has just reviewed a fiat 500e too
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,range is soo demonised last night my wife asked me if she can safely go to work in our i3 coz the battery is at 46 which the app says is good for 60km the temp is around freezing that is 10x her round trip to work and kindergarten weve had the car for 2 months now so we are still learning usually we juice up once a week just to keep the battery in 5080 zone out of 34 cars you mentioned my moneyd be spent on the mini its the most mature vehicle here the cars been perfected for 20 years and the powertrain for 7 and it drives better than mini jcw which i tested it back to back with
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,italian electrics what could possible go wrong
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,ive watched this post fullycharged both great videos i can tell you put a lot of effort into this i will always watch an electric car review also i live in birmingham and know those streets thanks
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,an electric fiatlets see how long this will last haha
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice swag great looking car too well rounded design that keeps he spirit of the original
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,only electric powered what a very sad day for motoring
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,it would be interesting to see on electric cars not just the 060 but its 010 020 030 etc
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,030 is the sweet spot on cars like this
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow well my friend put your money where your mouth is and start doing some 010 to 20 for everyone please
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,pleased you mentioned peaky blinders id have thought it was a norman wisdom themed review otherwise i like the car but evs need to lose a few pounds before i buy another in terms or price and weight
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,pity not rwd like original 500 could be done with electric motor
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the late brake show is my favourite show at the moment on any platform high production quality interesting topics and johnny youre a ledge keep up the good work
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice makes me want a fiat panda 4x4 e though
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,im 6foot 2 drive a bmw x5 but i like this fiat 500
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,ooooh how close to 200k subscribers you hitting refresh every 5 minutes jonny üòâ
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,only drove a 500 once as hire from rome to positano that was not a pleasant experience the car was utterly useless small underpowered engine clunky automatic transmission i have no doubt this electric version is better in every way but i would never buy a 500
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,lovely little car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,they prolonged ev subsidies in germany recently they might decide to make some more eup
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,ok johnny i am officially bored shitless of ev nowgo do some hydrogen fuel cell cars instead buddy that is where the real future is
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,ha piston vids coming soon hydrogen passenger cars good luck with that
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow no movement on the tech yet i remember when i was a kid in the 80s jonny ford were on tomorrows world saying they were close why the sudden change of tune i really like a lot of these evs but i just dont see them as the way forward or sustainablejust moves the problem to another place hydrogen on the other handbtw that defender was awesome best of the lot so far imho
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review the effort you put into this film really shows im not sold on evs because of the dodgy charge network and the lack of confidence and convenience they still display give me a car with 250 miles of range and an 80 charge in under 15 minutes and then i might be convinced the design of the car is truly italian and is a lovely package but can it match its japanese competitors for reliability and quality
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,unfortunately its a fiat it will break down
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the fiat 500e ev wins the most yt reviewed car of the week award but you win the best review for information and entertainment imho thanks
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i thought sherpa van to like the design of the new 500
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,yet another overpriced car incapable of delivering on the ev promise pay the earth for them find their range is nowhere near the manufacturers claims and on top of that monthly charges for battery hire struggle to find anywhere to charge it etc etc etc i purchased my peugeot 106 diesel 4 years ago for 500 it is worth more now and i get 80mpg out of it it wont be going anywhere soon
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,im out sorry no more ev crap
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,ok sorry i typically do 5050 ev and piston stuff plenty of petrol stuff coming
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow thank you
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review honest and to the point funny and emotional lovely car look forward to seeing them on the road prices keep creeping down
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,id say i prefer this to the honda e fiat
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i would say this is a more balanced city car than the honda e and the mini without being barebone as the zoe is does that make it better no its just different and thats great because it draws in more people theres now such a great choice of city cars in the ev world that its really hard not to find something you like and that fits your needs the only problem stays in the price but i guess well need time for that
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,got to say your review was really well detailed compared to fully charged
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,ive just watched them both back to back and have learnt many times more about the car from tlbs than fc
2020-12-11,JSwvQE0tgyM,well jonny is a professional car reviewer
2020-12-11,JSwvQE0tgyM,snakeyuk08 as more of the same car reviews come from both fc and tlbs that is becoming painfully obvious
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i would get a mini electric
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,though your review is good the car itself i find it not appealing as its too expensive
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice review jonny
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thats a good old fun top what an undeniably brilliant looking little car id have one
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,this is a beautiful car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great video liking this one very stylish good work you are getting me more into evs and the tech packed into them
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,wee nuit wassha cuty little 500 with your thumbnail piccy in the reveal post jonny
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i love its face with that menacing teddy bear smile
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,fantastic production values as always well done jonny ive had a honda e for nearly 3 months and it puts a smile on my face every time i drive it
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great to hear patrick what is life like with the honda e such a cool car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,any plans for a mx30 review
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i have one in soon but might just do social media on it as an ev it seems pretty weak but i could be wrong
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow no worse then the honda e or this 500 but has a usable trunk and okay backseats at least compared to the honda and fiat ha
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great video and a smart little car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,cute looking car it has to be said
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review jonny great production
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i have a crz and i want to move to a honda e but i just cant the range is too poor
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow my crz represents pretty much everything i enjoy in a car and i really really like it but strangely i dont love it in fact given current usage i would swap it for a new citroen ami electric in a heartbeat if i could
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,love the styling and nearly 200 mile range well done fiat just need a fiat panda poverty spec ev under 15 grand
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,im really really waiting for a proper panda ev hope fiat gets their shit together
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,briandowling8372 it could be a really cool car i really hope fca can get through it theyve looked a bit lost and out of touch with their origins lately id really like to have speedy small evs with the compromise between practicality style and that touch of sympathy than only fiat had
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,donkeymarco that would be very wise of them the centoventi singlehandedly restored my faith in the fiat brand and it would be a shame if it remained a concept forever but i have a feeling they were serious when they presented it
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,200 mile range 4x4 panda would be awesome
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,spruce1509 yes that would be awesome a simple light electric 4x4
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,for 2022 fiat panda 120 style ev is in work
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,in italy the basic 27 kwatt is priced 15k euros governament give 8k euros for ev and 20k for the more range version
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,very professional film beautiful car lovely music very informative lots of comparative data with its rivals much better than top gear or the grand tour i would buy one for sure
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,you are not driving the la prima your test car is the icon version la prima has white fauleather seats
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow ok suggest taking look at the fiat website have the la prima on reserve
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the turning off sound amused me more far more than it should i think vets should have that on standby next time your in there to have a pet put to sleep
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,in five years time people will still be admiring the fiat that was possibly your best video yet jonny an absolute masterpiece
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,cool video but just lacking his extra ussal design detailscar wow site goes a little bit extra
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,special credits to the costume department very appropriate for the location and matching the italian car design
2020-12-05,JSwvQE0tgyM,in 5 years time no more petrol cars not even hybrids all due to imbecile politicians from eu euro 7 and uk outright ban fu2025
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,right that was a peculiar run can we go back to petrol cars now please as in you know petrol head
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow 3rd ev video within 2 weeks love your content but the ev thing is a bit much i get ppl like them so channels do have to cover them but what i miss and is a bit unfair imo is ppl never show the time they spent charging the thing and never seem to mention how these cars will depreciate in value when a better batteryquicker chargingmuch longer range evs inevitably come to market i guess id rather celebrate tech thats mature and exciting thats just me though anyways keep up the good work
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,is it just me or does the face of the front end look like the leonardo dicaprio meme same expression of furrowed brow and smug smile lol
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i believe they based it on him yes
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,if the 500e car is as good as your video production then it is worth looking at
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,jonny is honestly one of the few that has gone from traditional media to social media and is really good at it may it be reviews like this one indepth geeky videos updates on his personal fleet or anything involving richard porter its always enjoyable
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i have pinned this not because i necessarily believe it to be true but in the hope that a brand will see the light and sponsor the channel thanks
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow i cant believe you dont have a sponsor yet are people mental this channel will be going places with its amazing and very well shot content you were born to do this jonny with you calm yet very witty and knowledgable style
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow i really hope that happens for you and most importantly you get to retain creative control
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i agree the thing that really makes the channel watchable for me is that jonny hasnt put him self in any of the more traditional motoring tribes hes not ev or nothing and hes not grrr petrol i know if i click on a lake brake show video it will be a well researched to the point that he isnt afraid to read from a little notebook well thought out and very nicely filmed his passion for all things car related comes across in every video without having to be in your face shouty
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,well said hes taken on board helpful constructive criticism and moved the show on professionally im signing up as a paid subscriber i just cant stand the word ptreon even though i just said it
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow love your casual approach and natural presenting style jonny detailed and entertaining hope you find a sponsor that fits with your brand and ethos
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow well it is true jonny and the key is that youre focused on the topics rather than on trying to be a presenter which is what most youtube car folk seem to concentrate on alas you have the advantage of being a naturally excellent presenter of course
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,his mrs is even funniersorry johnny
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,totally in agreement fullychargedshows review is a complete joke compared to this one
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,if we start a petition to get jonny sponsorship and just over half the people who watch this channel sign it they have to debate it in parliament that will get some attention dont you think come on people in fact i will i just started it httpspetitionparliamentukpetitions562716sponsorsnewtokenjv0l0n3xdg1sjywg_du0
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,its a really solid review and a pleasure to watch it leaves the fully charged review of the same car so far behind in the dust no offense meant to robert but their reviews are just not at this level of writing and production thanks for bringing the quality
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,hard to argue with this even when i dont love the car being featured its always interesting
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,paolo bernasconi i wonder if this may help you for context im in australia your experience may be different i no longer use the app to watch yt i use firefox instead i only get one advert at the start of each clip and occasionally one in the middle on the app yt was simply unwatchable and with what i reckon will be the everupward trajectory of jonnys show it will only get worse if my understanding is correct however its important to realise that the number and frequency of adverts is nothing to do with the particular channel youre viewing ie not jonnys fault or within his control
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow you should have more confidence in yourself jonny youre a great presenter and are one of my favourite car people in the last 10 years right up there with harris and needell youve a level of knowledge and professionalism that far exceeds influencers whove largely bought their way into youtube success by having rich daddys who can indulge their expensive habits each to their own but its not something i remotely care about or want to watch i also dont like people who play for the camera which a lot of influencers do youre just far more natural at this ive also enjoyed you bringing your wife into some of the recent videos too its obvious how much you care about her and i bet you troll each other constantly keep up the great work mate
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,action cant be the small battery becuase its going to be so less active
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow epic presented as ever and really nice filming and editing real quality
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow if thats the direction you wish to go you need to stop using the term car pervert it maybe apt but it will leave many corporate types cold but you probably already know that also comparing bobbyllews figures for a much younger channel your figures are looking far healthier
2020-12-04,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow a brand called netflix would be excellent
2020-12-14,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow way more relatable and engaging than mat lets drag race teslas everyday watson
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i think honestly johnny leaned on the whole peaky blinders thing way too heavily particularly with that backing music just wasnt doing it for me apart from that cracking car awesome review and thoughts on it informative and honest the renault zoe and the honda e would be the top contenders in my opinion people who buy a 500 want the easy driving and high style factor like the mini or the honda e potentially
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,honda e and fiat 500 makes the electric cars sexy for me
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the technology for these cars is brilliant my concerns are the batteries as good as the technology in the cars or will they like a ageing phone start losing charge quickly as they get older and charging points the governmentlocal authorities say they are going to put charging points basically everywhere but these are the same governmentlocal authorities that cant even fill potholes in our roads and more importantly the price of these electric cars that alone rules me out to ever buy one
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,did you change the channel name from car pervert
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow i agree with the change i never liked the name but always enjoyed the content
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,pretty cool would love to see vw do an ev beetle
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,top review mate that startupshutdown sound is dreadful i want mine to sound like the batmobile
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow yeah i found that just now its pretty cool those noises must be hackable id have thought i wish my golf gte did that
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,why must they constantly make all the small cars bigger each generation soon all the small cars will be the size of range rovers
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,because safety and comfort require thicker and thicker outer shells which if the outside didnt get bigger the interior would get smaller nobody wants to sit in a tin can even if the outside is nice and small
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,unfortunately they need the floorpan to be big enough in area for a decent sized battery pack
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,not a fan of those door handles unless theres a hidden lever or something if the accessory battery goes dead which is an alarmingly common problem on evs you have no way to get into the car meaning theres no way to get access to the 12v accessory battery to jump startrecharge it
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the ev reviews by mr smith are so detailed its hard not to fall in love with a car he rates
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,yes jonnys reviews are way better than lots of other yt videos
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,italian electrics what can go wrong
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,excellent review one thing didnt the recent 500 abarth have a 17 wheel option
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,fiat will tell you that isnt a 500
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow fair enough
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,does any of the car manufacturers have the guts to push their base models for reviews
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i love a base model but on first launch it is nigh on impossible to get access to them
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the quality of this review is astonishing thank you johnny
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the zoe is great on paper but everytime i see one or try to see myself in it i get depressed and feel sick its just so drab and ugly with lazy styling and a cheap feel
2020-12-13,JSwvQE0tgyM,i have the 2017 500c abarth and i was considering what electric car i would buy in addition to my abarth the only electric option that speaks to me in the us is the tesla for its performance but if there was an abarth version of the 500e i would do everything to get it in the us
2020-12-21,JSwvQE0tgyM,mini e looks to be the most sporty small ev at the moment would love to see an abarth version of the 500e
2021-12-01,JSwvQE0tgyM,eggegg2873 mini e is not small it wont fit in my garage unlike my 2002 r53 cooper s which does fit im sick and tired of each model revision of a car being bigger than the previous one
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,looks much nicer than the zoe clear italian style great review
2020-12-12,JSwvQE0tgyM,zoe is in a different class of size and it competes in pricequality fiat doesnt make sense beyond the cute looks
2021-05-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,uhohumm the zoe only has a better autonomy a field in which the 500 e is eventually 2nd in the quality and technology the fiat is better also because it came out later talking about the design the 500e is definitely better
2022-04-07,JSwvQE0tgyM,looks nice but only second car if wanted long range no or minimal breaks on journey id leave it at home about only ev id consider
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,very stylish review thanks for your honesty
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,yeah yeah i come from the west country cant hide my accent at times like that
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow dont mind me im just jealous
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,lovely car poor old digbeth needs an upgrade
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,shame they got rid of the red fiat badge
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,what a great review i own an outgoing 500 abarth and this captures the essence of the previous models design very well for the likes of young couples etc the range of evs is now big enough to give enough choice for people looking for a main family car at a reasonable price the 500e wins on styling for me bit of an audi a1style rear end with the tail lights as well
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice car fantastic episode just love the styling photo and combined story telling
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,fiat automatic door handles uh oh
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,this is a cool little car its a pity that the car as you reviewed it will be insanely expensive in ireland so not many will buy it most cars in ireland are usually bought with trim levels that wouldnt be out of place in rural india and the owners usually end up driving around in a low spec car that would make the designers cringe
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the original 500e was only sold in those places because they were the only places that had mass electric charging at the time and a high enough of eco friendly people
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,what a great little car lovely italian style and by the way the cap suits you
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,if the honda kept its original show car design that would be a close call id take this in a heartbeat what a beautiful little machine
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great videos top quality really great to see the growing market for ev options and also the different batterymotor specs for different markets thats the way it should be no need for a lot of power and battery if your car lives inside a city or m25 more to buy more to carry round more environmental impact
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,but higher starting price than mini and fiat
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,ive just watched fully charged review on this and you and robert have similar views on it
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,there seems to be a lot of comments from those that still look at the up front cost of an ev versus petroldiesel options ive ran a zoe for 18 months at a fraction of the cost of buying a second hand iced car ive done all the things you arent supposed to be able to do commuting 56 miles a day regular trips from torquay to heathrow luton and stanstead airports usually covered between 1500 and 1800 miles a month i cant charge at home or at work far quieter and smoother than it should be for its size and unlike your average small hatch you cant be bullied in traffic as you are with a small ice hatch this fiat is top of my list and liking the 11kw ac very useful oh i know have an electric van and electric motorbike im not wealthy i just take more notice of the advantages of evs than most im a mv tech so can keep old ice stuff on the road cheaper than most but the running costs of evs and very low maintenance is unbeatable the infrastructure needs to be better but it is getting better very quickly now
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,a really valuable testimonial doug thank you like you i try to explain the cost of ownership of evs to people as being a fraction of piston cars people often dont look beyond the initial windscreen price
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,hi jonny i think this car i believe deserves more attention than just talking about all the time of its rivals shame i think especially because otherwise i use to like your videos in my sight it ruins your unbiased image of you
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow thanks for reacting on it i dont want to be troll i just feel this car deserves more detailed attention than to showing that much of its rivals however i know its your opinion and not mine
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,fiat 500e with 500km range one can dream right
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,tidy little car executed well the key issue is still the same though if you live in a high rise in london or a tenement flat in glasgow where the hell are you gonna charge it
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,most people in london dont own cars theyve got nowhere to park them and london has a good public transport network
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the renault zoe seems better in every single category
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,very interesting video myself i have electric seat and my dream is to have ev fiat i thought i will share where i found good quality and affordable ev cables compared with other companies this one the best httpsevchargepluscom
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,42kwh battery is less than 5 grand put in a cheap metal car 30k for you sir lol
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i love it i hope mini follow suit with a small ev
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,gtfo are you serious the note 7 was a disaster yes but samsung is a giant battery supplier just like lg
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,or spend slightly more and get a real electric car a tesla
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,very cool review thanks a lot loved it bella cinematografia
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,just buy the twin air 2 cylinder rather than waste your money on an over priced tiny car with a small battery
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the battery isnt that small i love the twin air but its economy claims are smoke and mirrors
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i drove the original 500e and it was amazing theyve nailed this imo better than the hondae
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,this model 3 and a leaf make total sense as electric options if it is 99 recyclable and avoids traditional italian electrical issues then im all for it way better than the huge electric suvs
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,way too expensive lithium cells are 150 kwh this should be less than 20k its only 42kwh
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the problem isnt really the batteries but all the new hardware around it plus the software required the first models are always more expensive
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,alanmay7929 dont waste your time mr williams is a regular troll
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,windows up for smoking too thats full commitment to the cause what a fucking legend
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,two things they missed the chance to make it rear engined rwd would be a fun little beast second now that they porduce them in italy does this mean the quality is going to be even worse d
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,yeah rwd like the original and yet cars like the honda e is rwd strange huh
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow maybe for room i just think it is a missed oppertunity
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,what a stunning little car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,it is but while i can still pick up a mint 2 year old bmw m140i for less money i intend to do so one day it wont be an option and this stunning little car and its ilk will be the only choice youll have ill enjoy it when the time comes but im not done enjoying the rare treats we already have on the menu
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,darknewt9959 well said just bought an 18month 335d fully loaded for 20k euro6 clean as and goes very well indeed thank you until these over priced milf floats come down in price i think i will leave these and trinkets for the middle classes to buy and pretend they are making a difference
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,rogernewton7831 hahahaha i never noticed however i shall leave it as is
2020-12-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,darknewt9959 well you can always pick up a used car for a lot less than a new one in the same way i could say no a nmw m140i is a bad option because there is a 8 year old mercedes c 180d for the same price tag
2020-12-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,mell3109 you expect a new car to compete with used ones which is nonsense for electric and for gas cars
2020-12-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,ismalith i expect value for money and a quality level to match the price tag
2020-12-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,ismalith nonsense a 2 year old car has plenty of life in it a typical 8 year old car is half way to the wreckers yard
2020-12-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,darknewt9959 a well maintained 8 year old car can easily outlive a 2 year old car on the other hand a new fiat 500e will outlive both by at least a decade as long as fiat didnt allow themselves a big blunder or you crash it the point is newer cars always cost more than older used ones as long as you are in the regular car marked what you choose depends on what you want some wnat up to date technology and the feel that a car is their car so they pay the new price tag others dont care for that and are well off with used cars i personally would always prefer the luxury of an electric drive train over a unreliable and problemativ gas drive train so for me a 2 year old bmw 1 series wont be the better deal that doesnt say anything about the two cars also a new bmw 1 series costs around 35000 where i live and the fiat 500 36000 without subsidy so the fiat 500 is definitely not that expensive
2020-12-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,mell3109 you know that this are just empty words right what is value for you and what price tag maches what quality level and bmw is not exactly know for building exceptional reliable cars i would definetly argue that qualityprice wise you would be better of with a vauxall or opel astra than a bmw 1 since the quality advantage of bmw vs the astras is marginal at best and definitely not two times as high also we do not know how well fiat build that 500 given the high reliability of electric drive trains it isnt a long shot to assume that the fiat might actually be able to outlive two bmw 1 series for an over all price tag that is lower than one
2020-12-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,ismalith value is the perceived level of good for the cash quality is will it fall to bits fiat isnt exactly know for quality products if its quality discussion measure against japan and their products however i cant accept that a tiny car it being traded for twice the money of a petrol vauxhall when it will only last max 10 years the petrol version is able to last a lot longer i have a 48 year old jensen interceptor the carbon used to manufacture it has long been forgotten about so to total carbon footprint is tiny compared to this have a look at harrys garage where he goes through the figures interesting watch i agree we need technical solutions to overcome the current problems but this is not the solution i made this the other day tell me how this is going to work
2020-12-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,mell3109 why do you assume that the gas 500 will last longer or any gas engine for that matter gas engines have usualyl very low life spans with around 200000km reliable and why do you assume that the carbon footprint of manufacturing is high vauxhalls last at least 20 years usually 30 with a bit care that is just as long as bmws last also your jenson has gas mileages that you turn your key once and you got more than this fiat 500 on 1000 miles
2020-12-08,JSwvQE0tgyM,ismalith the batteries will not go past 10 years the petrol car can last a lot longer the carbon production per unit the electric is far higher unfortunately re the jensen it only does about 1000 miles per year although mpg is poor it is still hugely better than electric as the manufacturing footprint is so low as we are almost 50 years in the car in its lifetime has only done 50k miles if you go like for like you would need to buy 5 electric cars over the same period its not even close factor in that infrastructure is not doable to account for the transport needs then this is a dud in the uk there are 40million cars in the uk the muppets who are in charge who obviously cant do basic maths how stated that not only will they prevent fossil fuel transport but 2030 but the strategy will be based around electric im baffled have a look at this this type of housing is typical in the uk how do we put in an infrastructure to cope with this charging will have to be done away from the home so we will have churching parks in the middle of retail parks what if you just want to charge it
2020-12-24,JSwvQE0tgyM,this fiat 500 is awesome and classy
2021-01-25,JSwvQE0tgyM,bohemianphotographer6843 it reacts better than whatever garbage you are driving costs less and doesnt sound like broken shaver
2021-01-25,JSwvQE0tgyM,ismalith of course you know what im driving go to sleep mate you need it üòÇ
2021-01-25,JSwvQE0tgyM,one of the best looking city cars and excellent value for money compared to other electric cars fiat has always been excellent for mini cars
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i think your best work yet good honest evaluation of an awesome looking fiat
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,why does the i3 get excluded from everyones comparisons
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,simply because of price the i3 is awesome and i rate it hugely but these cars start in the early 20k
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review my dream car would be an electric fiat panda cross fingers crossed theyll make it sometime in the near future
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,id love to get my mk2 retrofitted great little car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,45 mkwh is great i dig the facelift and the figaro rolltop convertible another italian reference lol also just realized that the eyebrow lights mimic the split 0s in the 500 logo which is a cool design touch and those manholecover wheels are kinda groovy too
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,if you like brum accent watch car wow utube site videosand a little more detail but still the laughs
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,this review is so well produced and presented streets ahead apologies üòÇüôè car is a real achievement stylistically and conceptually
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,not sure how those vw electric vehicles can be compared with this italian beauty sans front grill
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,most probably fiat500e will compete in city car ice segment together with honda e as john stated while vw is competing in its own bigger category no new ev is going to steal sales from each other but rather from ice versions that is great since lets face it the choice range in ev is far less than in ice world for now so the more ev choices the better and by the way despite drone views for this car made in california for its commercials online the car itself will not be available for sale in north america unfortunately so no global audience for now sadly
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,ffix iit aagain ttomorrow the italians invented the electrical fault
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,when was the last time youve owned a fiat
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,tacodias i was in love with fiat over the years and you grin and bear little problems over the years then you wake up and realize theres better cars out there
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,superb review as always jonny
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,do you review cars that arent electric
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,yes usually the content is 5050 but lots of ev launches lately i have cool piston things coming
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice outfit nice car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,im straight from robs review i think its a little pricey and a little bit short on seats needs to be 4 seat great package though with the setup it has a 22 drophead could have been possible a real drophead coupe like the 124 sport coupe only a bit lifted and fatter
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,you reviewing cars like the honda e and 500e so early will bring an avalanche of new viewers
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,will you be doing a review of the new citroen ec4 when it comes out
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the 500e looks better than all the other small evs in my opinion that is the only car that could tempt me out of my petrol car however it is a bit of a bloater compared to the petrol 500 it looks like it has been locked up in a pie shop for a few weeks
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,excellent video just watched full charged video and i honestly think yours is much better not saying robert did a bad job bravo keep up the great videos
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,came here to say exactly the same thing so much more information but without it becoming a power point show great work
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,robert just blathers gave up watching him months ago his spiel never varies and hes boring johnny is streets ahead in all respects
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the renault zoe seems to be the best choice that nobody wants they win like every test in the magazines yet i havent even seen one in the wild
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,ive seen a lot here in devon but hard to spot the latest 50kw model over the 22 and 40 unless you know what to look for
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,they are all over the place here in stockholm even more common than model 3
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i agree the zoe is an awesome car i love the latest iteration but yet it is so often forgotten no idea why
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,and im still here waiting for the first 4x4 overland electric vehicle
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,sidowse if theyll ever deliver probably not
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i have to say of all the small ev cars the fiat is head and shoulders above from a style point of view good review
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,honda still looks way better than this fiat
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,alanmay7929 i love the honda e probably more than the 500e but is it way better stylistically i tend to like the honda e a little bit more but i can totally see how someone might like the fiat more the inside of the honda e is a bit cooler and funkier the inside of the fiat maybe a little bit more stylish the outside of the fiat is more elegant and cuter whilst the outside of the honda is more interesting modern both great cars really
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,ewadge the 500e seems to be in sort of a middle ground stylish but not too fancy although it looks good its not a fridge range and ev stuff pretty good but not excelent and for an attractive price i think fiat here got the best compromise
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,its as though fiat has remembered oh wait were the best at making small cars
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,reddsoldier lol they do that sometimes
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,reddsoldier hope they make it i like fiat despite all the hate they get
2021-10-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,ilpatongi same here not even close
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review jonny as always balanced informative unbiased and entertaining thanks
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,that looks to be a great little car range slightly better than my existing 120ah bmw i3s which does us just fine as a daily driver on y 130miles a day commute should be cheaper to lease too if slower possibly not as capable dynamically
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,you can get an 18 month old 500 for under 10k the prices dont stack up
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,last gen is not electric not really comparable
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,kidoctane thats true but the arbath edition 500 was the top of the line limited edition not focused at the wider small car market the electric 500 here is focused at the wider small car market so when the base model costs almost as much as as an arbath then questions need to be asked about what youre getting in return
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,mylesclark1757 hum the abarth 500595695 is a somewhat of a mainstream version there have been some limited edition versions like the outrageously priced biposto although not a huge seller its been a consistent seller for over 10 years my point is that while the 500e is undoubtedly pricey now there are ppl who will pay that sort of money for an interesting small car it is early days for the ev market so all ev cars are pricey the 500e seems competitively priced against its opposition i expect that over time that ev car prices will reduce as numbers increase and they become more mainstream me assuming that the 500e is released in my country australia and its priced comparable to an abarth hello and take my
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great camera work in the opening sequence nice car congrats on not getting stabbed in the face
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,everything you can like on the styling is just something only the italians can manage those wheels üòç
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,stevetaylor7650 dont think i have only seen the 31 and these
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great review great car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,actually an excellent video the main stream manufacturers are getting their act together finally focusing on the smaller size cars yes honda are the first with a new design whilst mini and fiat want to maintain the heritage links it will be interesting to see if mini actually pursue the recent published concept a smaller three door a crossover and larger countryman ev based
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,yeah that front grill looks gaudy with that 500 on it not very italian at all thats a shame for an otherwise good looking car
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,and holy hell they are still using those fiat parts bin electric window switches the same ones that ruin the interior of the alfa 159 giulietta brera and 4c unbelievable fiat couldnt grab anything from the giulia eh
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,jonny i think your decision to diversify your own channel has been a great success you never know what kind of vehicle your going to get from week to week keeps it spicy üòÖ loving the production these days too
2020-12-03,JSwvQE0tgyM,thelatebrakeshow in the menswear business we call them vests but to the customers we call them waistcoats
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,an excellent video jonny which shows that in terms of city cars at least there is now a good selection of quality and interesting options
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,yeah those crzs would be so sick as a bev
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,hmm cleaver electronic door handles and an italian car what could possibly go wrong üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,agreed highlevel quality and tasteful execution very pleasant to watch
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,bobbylew just beat you to it with an hour or so but nice with different views on the same car üòé
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,yeah iconic design like the honda e maybe the 2nd gen of both cars will get more affordable
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,please dont focus just on electric carit seems that nowadaysnot because i hate it becuase it is expensive to most people
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,cheeky little car good looking i dont get the whole interest in electric cars its not the future its not sustainable from start to end and its not green i get it for small one off specials but mass production with the issue of supply in the metals required for the batteries it doesnt work why are we supporting the chinese as this is where the the batteries are produced why arent we supporting hydrogen fuel cell technology which is where the uk come in infinitely more sustainable and much more green in essence we are supporting the wrong technology as a race
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,you do realize that fuel cells have even more exotic and expensive materials than batteries and hfcevs still have batteries anyway and that the losses just never work out why throw away half of the energy you produce for an expensive difficult storage medium how is that green
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,patreekotime4578 i do realise they have exotic materials however they are in far more plentiful supply than those used in batteries there are presently only 3 countries able to mine the metals for batteries and if a country the size of wales decided tomorrow that only battery cars were to be used 3 million people one of those countries producing these metals would dry up completely the other aspect from an environmental perspective is where do these batteries go at end of life in the uk ineos is already producing 350 thousand tonnes of hydrogen a year and have signed a deal with kia to get things moving we then come on to charging electric cars how can people in terrace houses charge them do we leave cables running over pavements sidewalks for people to trip over we already have a ready made infrastructure for dispensing hydrogen they are called petrol stations gas stations safety is no less than that of battery cars the car richard hammond crashed rimac took three days to extinguish the fire due to all the cells combusting in a chain reaction then we come into the shipping of the metals from various countries to china heavy fuel oil at least in europe we have mgo marine gas oil which a more highly refined fuel emitting less fumes china are not yet interested in lowering emissions oh and by the way the uk national grid electricity is already running at 95 capacity the only reason this is all going ahead is due to government the same was true of diesel engines and look where that got us solved the o zone but gave more people is cities breathing problems now they are taxing us out of diesel into another white elephant
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,nice city runabout
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,as an american i feel like this is too late the last 500 series was blasted with quality issues due to the new mexico plant and the car is back its euro only roots so its great its updated but ill never get to drive it
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,when are there gonna be electric cars for less than 20k so far all these cars are well outside my price range
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,technically the 500 already is 1114 but i think the same at the moment evs seem to be a good secondary car but cost more than your main car which is exaggerated by the fact that there is only a questionable used car market for evs so in my mind i compare new ev prizing with preowned petrol cars
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,someone needs to make a car under 20k theres a huge huge market for that
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,scottpc exactly i dont need all these fancy screens and stuff just give me a reliable ev with decent range and the ability to rapid charge for less than 20k
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,the problem is evs dont scale in capability with ice vehicles because a 10 gallon fuel tank only cost the manufacturer a few hundred bucks and fills just as fast and has 300 miles range even in a 14k car but the battery alone to have 300 mile range cost more than 14k and it will take longer to fill to 300 miles range
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,elkott unfortunately there seems to be an expectation for every car to have highly advanced safety and self driving to some extent regardless of size thats pushing the price of all cars up not just evs
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,great video the car the new fiat 500 should have always been
2020-12-02,JSwvQE0tgyM,i saw carwow do a video on this and ive been waiting to see it since its stunning
2022-03-06,brvvaWzs63Y,gotta love that car cover though
2022-01-20,brvvaWzs63Y,i own a fiat 500e and no way can you get 199 miles i drive 23 miles to work but use around double that in range loss
2022-01-02,brvvaWzs63Y,i want one so bad i wish they sold this in the states electric convertible its perfect
2022-01-03,brvvaWzs63Y,lots of americans seem to like the idea of the 500e hopefully they bring it over there
2021-11-26,brvvaWzs63Y,so excited i have just signed on the dotted line for this car today i had it out for a 40 min test drive this morning and fell in love only downside is i have to wait until january for it
2021-10-29,brvvaWzs63Y,carrying people in the back of your car is not an emergency it could possibly be on the odd occasion
2021-10-28,brvvaWzs63Y,im a 23 year old man and even i love this car got one on order
2021-10-27,brvvaWzs63Y,i cant wait for an abarth 500e but im worried how expensive it might be if its 40k then it will be a hard sell
2021-10-20,brvvaWzs63Y,cheap lecky cars junk no range bad ride quality heavy batteries throw u about dont listen to these blaggers test drive on bumpy road this person knows nothing about cars
2021-10-10,brvvaWzs63Y,top review top totty sorry good detail and yes i to love the new 500
2021-09-22,brvvaWzs63Y,i wish they sell this car in us
2021-09-19,brvvaWzs63Y,i want that car cover for my classic 2015 fiat 500e
2021-08-16,brvvaWzs63Y,just 21000 just why is it two times the price of the nearly identical petrol version im out until they become much cheaper
2021-08-16,brvvaWzs63Y,it is true that its very sad when 21000 is at the lowest scale of evs
2021-06-25,brvvaWzs63Y,haha im getting mine in 3 days i cant wait you people must try it out its so amazing to drive it
2021-06-26,brvvaWzs63Y,how exciting what colour did you go for
2021-06-26,brvvaWzs63Y,autosocialuk im getting a cabrio ocean green laprima
2021-06-13,brvvaWzs63Y,fantastic review and a fantastic little accessory
2021-06-16,brvvaWzs63Y,autosocialuk no at all yet able to say so well grill detail wheels and so on even though english is not my first language
2021-06-11,brvvaWzs63Y,i really enjoy watching your reviews very informative and straight to the point excellent
2021-06-10,brvvaWzs63Y,looking for an ev to replace my current fiat 500 and what do you know fiat 500e is the only good looking option although it is a shame that it costs double the price of the ice models i am sure that the build quality is nowhere near the 30k price tag and the government grand at this point feels more like a reason to keep the prices high since all the marketing materials tell you the price with the grand included hopefully it will be possible to find a used one for 1520k in a couple of years please do not support this 30k ev madness affordable evs is what we need to save the planet
2021-06-12,brvvaWzs63Y,i could not agree more i think brands like dacia will start building affordable evs and that will bring the prices done fingers crossed the entry level 500e doesnt even have a radio that is madness
2021-06-09,brvvaWzs63Y,i had an original fiat 500 although i like the look of the electric vehicle technology scares me a bit i would buy one just because its so compact and it has a decent range i dont think of it as a girlie car well i drive a smart diesel üòÅ
2021-06-12,brvvaWzs63Y,the tech can be a bit bossy sometimes when youre driving its always bleeping for something or another
2021-06-06,brvvaWzs63Y,great review and a wonderful little car if i went electric this is the one as i loved my twin air an icon
2021-06-05,brvvaWzs63Y,it is la prima pronounce preema and not le primma also the t is silent in renault apart from that nice review
2021-06-04,brvvaWzs63Y,overhyped and waaay overpriced
2021-06-04,brvvaWzs63Y,i havent really heard many people mentioning them and the prices are in line with other electric cars
2021-06-03,brvvaWzs63Y,great review thank you would love to see you review the minie and compare the two
2021-06-03,brvvaWzs63Y,they couldnt even change the start engine button to something else smh
2021-06-03,brvvaWzs63Y,very good point although as it is under 35k you do get the 2500 government grant as well
2021-06-12,brvvaWzs63Y,paolopetrozzi2213 yes because youre only ever allowed to compare convertibles with other convertibles as enshrined in the law
2021-06-12,brvvaWzs63Y,af252 if you want a convertible you cannot have it from tesla so your price comparison does not make any sense at all how old are you 12
2021-06-03,brvvaWzs63Y,honestly i always liked fiat 500s ill never buy one because im 64 but to anyone smaller its a great car
2021-06-03,brvvaWzs63Y,using the 500 logo to hide the sensors is great idea love it who would buy one with the small battery as a second city only car used leafs and zoes exist for under half the price
2021-06-04,brvvaWzs63Y,i like the new front badge not sure on the rear one yer its definitely something you would get if you loved fiats and didnt need to go far
2021-06-06,brvvaWzs63Y,comparing new and used caror anything really will almost always favor the used ones at any price range so for me personally its a bit unfair
2021-06-08,brvvaWzs63Y,autosocialuk yeah its pretty ordinary at the back the square lights dont help
2021-06-08,brvvaWzs63Y,hellmekun for the same range and just commute abilities why spend the extra money where is the extra tech compared to an old leaf on the 500 it doesnt move the game on
2021-06-03,brvvaWzs63Y,great video tish currently watching this in the hospital again and not to be clich√© but it did take my mind off what was happening for a bit not the biggest fan of the 500 but it just makes sense to be an ev
2021-06-03,brvvaWzs63Y,lovely review üòç
2021-06-02,brvvaWzs63Y,that car would suit you i think tish i love the design of the steering wheel too
2021-06-02,brvvaWzs63Y,lets be honest for 33000 pounds its too little a car you are getting looks alone cant replace practicality and economy if you are paying such a heavy bag of cash and dont get the range space and other basics then i think its exploitation in the name of e cars actually almost all the car makers are doing that these days how do you save when you are paying huge cash upfront and lose the peace of mind that you get with ices good city cars in my opinion were nissan micra and suzuki alto in the late 90s and 2000s
2021-06-02,brvvaWzs63Y,another great review tish really useful information for people who are interested in purchasing one i love the front end styling not keen on the stitching of fiat in the seats though for me its a bit too much is a mirror in the drivers sunvisor that important for a lady looking for a car
2021-11-26,brvvaWzs63Y,as a female i find it bizarre that fiat 500s do not have a mirror on drivers visor strange but important no not for this female i test drive one of these today my 1st of a few test drives id lined uphad to cancel all others i loved this car so much
2021-06-02,brvvaWzs63Y,a other cracking review tish really enjoying the electric reviews i am waiting for the all electric pickupbeing a pickup fan i am surprised we havent got one yet keep up the great reviews üòâ
2022-09-14,brvvaWzs63Y,there you are jim your prayers have been answered httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv6tkpj09xmbut708sab_channelcarwow
2021-06-02,brvvaWzs63Y,nice looking fiat very modern looking too like the colour of it also
2021-06-03,brvvaWzs63Y,whats bad about not being first
2021-06-03,brvvaWzs63Y,davedvideomaker by me saying first is one of many ways i like to show support to tish if you dont like it dont make any comments
2021-06-02,brvvaWzs63Y,nice cars üòç
2021-06-02,brvvaWzs63Y,lovely gorgeous and great lookingthe cars not bad eitherüòú
2021-06-02,brvvaWzs63Y,i enjoyed watching the video review i particularly like the interior design
2021-06-02,brvvaWzs63Y,thank you jamie the interior was great
2021-06-02,brvvaWzs63Y,nice review tish cute little car this fiat 500e but too girly for a bloke like myself some girls might but do you really need that mirror üòéüòé
2021-06-02,brvvaWzs63Y,hahaha mirrors are handy even if you want to check you havent got something in your teeth üòÖüòÖüòÖ
2021-06-02,brvvaWzs63Y,absolutely awesome review the fiat 500e looks absolutely stunning compared to previous models looking forward to the next review
2021-06-02,brvvaWzs63Y,its a really cool little car now i liked it a lot üòÅ
2021-06-02,brvvaWzs63Y,great car but too expensive
2021-06-02,brvvaWzs63Y,yes i see your point although the cheapest spec costs less than the honda e and mini electric
2021-06-02,brvvaWzs63Y,the normal fiat 500 is seriously uncool but the 500e is better plus they used to sell a previous 500 electric in north america
2021-06-02,brvvaWzs63Y,yer they definitely feel and drive a lot better than the standard car
2024-05-17,Uvm-FxufxP8,guy wheeling a scooter only in miami and certain parts of the bronx i really considered getting one of the previous 500e way back before covid i think the golfball dimples were inspired by that one mythbusters episode i didnt have easy access to a charger unfortunately and charging infrastructure _still_ doesnt seem ideal but i like that theyre back with the new one as someone who likes small cars
2024-05-07,Uvm-FxufxP8,happy with my honda jazz crosstar 2023 hybridmore interior roommore safetys10 airbags and utillitiesreliable and build qualityfor 32 000 e
2024-05-07,Uvm-FxufxP8,i think these are great fold those back seats down and you got a great hatchback thats a blast to drive i had the previous model it was a blast this should be even better
2024-05-06,Uvm-FxufxP8,when covering evs it would be nice if you knew what battery chemistry is being used how many charging cycles energy density in whkg cooling features preconditioning features battery crate who makes the battery etc please consider providing this info in future videos for 35k i can buy a low mileage used kia ev6 with a 310 mile range this car is too expensive
2024-04-21,Uvm-FxufxP8,a version of this emulating the 1959 fiat jolly would be nice especially since the sound is gone needs some soul injected back into it
2024-04-17,Uvm-FxufxP8,yes needs to be priced like the upcoming renault twingo ev
2024-04-16,Uvm-FxufxP8,having driven the 500e and owned the previous mini cooper electric which one would you rather purchase to cruise around the city
2024-04-16,Uvm-FxufxP8,if it had about 52kw batteryi would consider iti like the looks much better than the konawhich i think is fuglybut with the longer range
2024-04-12,Uvm-FxufxP8,i had a 2013 500e and the sales lady fit in the back seat just fine i had a friend who had a kid that was 810 years old and she liked riding back there but most of the time i kept the rear seats down and that makes a really great cargo area i used it to take my folding ebikes to trails if they made the front passenger seat fold it would be even better
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,good city car or country car or anything car except frequent long trips
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,i am still waiting for my red order to be built and shipped it is perfect for ny city
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,for the price of a loaded 500e its competing with a base tesla model 3 which has more range nearly double the acceleration more interior space an extra set of doors more cargo space nicer interior materials and the second lowest probably of injury in an accident by the nhtsa
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,too too expensive otherwise its ideal for the elderly driverif price lower it would sell in thousands
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,brilliant car i love those lovely european city cars planning on getting one
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,i too am a fan boy of sub compacts and this is the one ive been waiting for i was very excited to see your review posted tonight thanks for making my day
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,price is fine but the range will kill it before it can even get started
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,looks like a good city car for one or two people price is too high as mentioned by another poster buy on the used market in a few years
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,we own the new 500e in europe it is a really good electric car and we love it good for city driving but also very nice to drive on the highway has level 2 autonimous driving which works fine if you have owned the previous 500 model petrol or ev this is a hugh step forward
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,i love this car homelike the old bmw i3
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,so if youre in the heat using the ac full blast the range is maybe 120mi
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,i dont know about the us market but in europe you can get a used telsa for 17k but absolutely not the old 500e if you can even find one people seem to keep them
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,buddy1155 unfortunately for you im in la which is probably also why there are so many available in the states cali ran an incentive program that encouraged a lot of people to buy into the 500e line
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,a teeny car what happens when the fiat 500e meets a escalade iq in a narrow alley with no passing room well its a lot of things but sexy isnt one of them
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,we preorder the new rose gold trim inspired by beauty however after meeting with the local dealer even with the 7500 lease credit through stellantis lease was still quoted over 600mo for 10000mi 36mo term before credit check just their best estimate and that was even with a 3000 trade in credit old fiat 500 on top of that the msrp and terrible lease numbers are going to ruin the success of this car before it even gets off the starting line im genuinely offended by the pricing of this car being a longtime fiat fan
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,thats a shame i owned a bolt for a year and a half but realized i dont actually need all that range and smaller would be more useful for my city driving this is the perfect range and size and presumably a nicer interior for about the same price as my bolt was but a 600mo lease is nuts
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,we purchased our stepdaughter who was in high school at the time an offlease low mileage fiat 500e which depreciated and we were able to get at 10000k frankly its the perfect car for a teenager the range was fine for her to drive to school and in town trips and it charged overnight on level 1 she loved it loved the looks and size and she kept with the electric motif and now drives a bmw ix which she uses as a tax writeoff for her business what was unique was that we bought the car in colorado and the dealer had them shipped out to denver due to them being a glut in california if we lived in ca i remember at the time seeing those 99 leases and would have leased her one
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,its too expensive here in europe because fiat wants the affluent mini buyers the 500e should come as a giardinia eatate it should offer a mid teir baytery between 24kwh and 44kwh and above all else a panda version on the same platform
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,agreed a small relatively inexpensive ev may be the best application for electric vehicles we have an overabundance of largeexpensivecomplex vehicles that are out of reach for most people i really dont care about the next high priced ev and i say that as the owner of a bmw i4 for a year and a half now small inexpensive uncomplicated evs should be a focal point for auto manufacturers get the price down more worry more about charging infrastructure than range and i think the market will grow
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,im glad to see it in the us i love my mini cooper se but if the fiat 500e had existed last year i would have been torn on which one to get
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,american bottoms are too big for this car
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,regenerative braking should primarily be done when applying the brake pedal not automatically with one pedal driving i know ev buyers love one pedal driving but aggressive one pedal driving can be dangerous particularly in the city you cant maintain speed and cover the brake pedal at the same time reducing your reaction time this is one of the reasons tesla has such extremely high accident rates
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,in driving school you are taught when and where to cover the brake pedal like around pedestrians or when a driver is sitting in a car that is parallel parked
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,i disagree having blended braking can make the brake pedal very unpredictable in a lot of cars like in the maverick hybrid where it feels like youre slamming on the brakes below 7mph and its extremely hard to stop smoothly i prefer having the brake pedal just connected hydraulically and leave the gas pedal liftoff for regen gives you more braking confidence when you need it if you make the regen strong enough it should be able to bring the vehicle to a stop quickly and smoothly especially once you get used to it
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,blackvillain that is a separate issue that isnt found in all cars with regenerative braking regardless one pedal driving shouldnt replace covering your brake pedal regenerative braking is not meant for emergency stops it shouldnt matter how smooth it is or isnt an emergency stop is an emergency stop the faster you stop the better
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,allentechpt9026 exactly regen doesnt replace emergency stops thats what your brake pedal is for if you have your foot off of the gas pedal while regening anyway theres no reason you cant cover the brake pedal for an emergency stop i did this the few times back when i had my i3 and was driving downtown in urban areas
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,blackvillain yes there is a reason if regen is so strong you are going to keep your foot on the accelerator to maintain speed this means you cannot cover the brake and maintain speed this is not a problem in cars without regen
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,stgeorgee im not wrong about anything you cannot maintain speed with regenerative brake your comment doesnt refute that
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,kendrick5909 you can also fail a driving exam by use of regenerative brake
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,due the lack of proper driver training many people dont even comprehend the purpose of covering the brake
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,geragosian805 thats right there are examples of people falling drivers tests because they didnt cover their brake pedals
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,allentechpt9026 i feel like you havent driven many evs or at least not for a long period of time theres no reason to maintain speed in an ev you see your intersectionstop signwhatever coming up you know how long it takes the car to naturally stop you let off of the gas you can feel free to cover the brake pedal from that point if youre in an area with pedestrians
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,this also can apply to engine and exhaust brakes on diesels on our trucks diesels the exhaust brakes only work at certain rpm at low speeds and low rpm the exhaust brake completely shuts off those who complain about poor blending brakes well that to your delivery driver its about the most poorly blended braking you can imagine still its for safety because its better than slower reaction time covering the brake is just basic basic safety training
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,blackvillain part of my job is driving evs or cars with regenerative braking i also work with insurance companies that are studying this issue regenerative braking has become a massive safety issue in any way your ad hominem doesnt refute a thing ive said so everything i said still stands
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,geragosian805 yes exactly any properly trained driving examiner will give you an automatic failure for overuse of regen
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,akiowasright the cut off isnt necessary due to safety programming exhaust brakes stall or lug the engine at low rpm
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,allentechpt9026 i understand im just saying that your point is already understood by many a lot of ev drivers havent learned yet
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,one pedal driving bub you miss that part
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,im surprised more people havent pointed this out the first time i drove an ev its one of the first things i noticed you could not coast or cover the brake pedal without the car slowing itself down or stopping completely thankfully some electric cars allow you to turn it off i believe
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,krane15 how did i miss one pedal driving
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,im not disagreeing but there is a reason they invented automatic emergency braking its not a 100 solution nor should it replace proper driving skill but thats whats expected these days drivers generally do not have the attentiveness or skill to avoid certain accidents many dont really even have a general grasp of defensive driving talking about covering the brakes and its purpose are beyond most drivers theyre just not to that level because of low standards for licensing they were not to the level from the start
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,geragosian805 yes but many still get by the examiners often dont pay attention to your pedal control there needs to be strict rules on this
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,you can just set the cruise control to maintain speed then cover the brake but you do you
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,ridiculous its the same as an automatic no one drives with both feet on the pedals false statistic about teslas
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,rp9674 covering the brake pedal doesnt necessarily involve both feet really this is basic stuff its very clear you arent a properly trained driver also its not a false static the data was collected by lendingtree between november 2022 and november 2023 with 2354 accidents per 1000 drivers tesla had the highest accident rate
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,cloud30000 youre going to set the cruise just to cover the brake where do you people come up with this how did you get a drivers license
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,allentechpt9026 you mean my class a cdl with endorsements i guess im just lucky or maybe you dont know as much about driving as you seem to proclaim
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,i dont have time to teach everyone how to drive
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,allentechpt9026 you think teslas accident statistics might have more to do with poorly marketing autopilot and full self driving over one pedal driving do all onepedalmode evs have higher accident statistics than their ice equivalents
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,cloud30000 its not just tesla evs overall have higher accident rates thats not all because of one pedal driving but thats just one of the many things
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,rp9674 i do so listen and learn this is what drivers ed says the cover braking technique involves taking your right foot off the accelerator and holding it over the brake pedal if you have to stop quickly your foot is already above the brake pedal and is in the perfect position to press the brake this method will improve your reaction time so whenever you identify a hazard cover the brake to prepare for sudden stops or slowing when covering the brake be careful not to rest your foot on the brake pedal also known as riding the brake riding the brake is not recommended it will only confuse other drivers and add unnecessary wear to the brakes simple isnt it
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,cloud30000 with your suggestion any driver would fail an exam again how did you get drivers license
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,allentechpt9026 can you point out the documented exam criteria that using the cruise control fails if it does not prevent you from covering the brake because i have not heard of such criteria though it has been a long time since ive taken the exam the ev manufacturers would be the first to sue the driving instructorstesters if they cost sales statistics by failing all owners of one pedal mode evs could you link a reliable government source that has acknowledged that one pedal mode has led to license test failures or is this just speculation based on your opinion of what qualifies as preventing passing have you even taken the driving test do you know what it actually consists of how did you get your driving license
2024-04-12,Uvm-FxufxP8,allentechpt9026nervous scared drivers are dangerous you should try to relax but stay alert safest if you drive in the right lane
2024-04-12,Uvm-FxufxP8,ive driven stick shifts automatic one pedal two pedal braking paddle on the steering wheel it all works the theoretical differences are very minimal in real world
2024-04-12,Uvm-FxufxP8,allentechpt9026you know you can move your foot right ive been driving evs for over seven years and i have never had a problem putting my foot on the brake when i needed to stop quickly the overwhelming majority of the time you are used to how the one pedal deceleration works and take your foot off the accelerator and let the thing slow down behind the car in front if i found myself needing to slam the brakes a lot i would need a new insurance company because they record all those stops
2024-04-13,Uvm-FxufxP8,allentechpt9026 imagine this situation youre driving along at 60mph and all of a sudden traffic stops in front of you with your foot on the accelerator the moment you lift off to apply the hydraulic brakes the regen is already workibg at max power to slow down before youre even applying the hydraulic brakes if we are using regen on the brake pedal youre driving along and you life off to apply the brakes you get nothing until the brake is fully applyed passed the point of regen having more response is always safer and having the car slow down from lifting your foot up before even applying the brake is going to slow you down faster than if one pedal driving was not enabled
2024-04-13,Uvm-FxufxP8,allentechpt9026 i have a feeling its due to a false sense of safety and the kind of people that buy evs are generally those that have their car do the work for them i mean look at all those idiots in teslas falling asleep at the wheel with autopilot when those people drive ice cars they usually have lower tech and must therefore pay attention but once theyre put into a high tech ekectric car that does all the paying attention for them they slack off and let the car do the work thats my thinking as to why evs end up in more accidents its not the cars but the people who choose to buy cars with a high level of technology that lets them be lazy
2024-04-13,Uvm-FxufxP8,kenmcclow8963hes talking about emergency braking say youre driving through town coasting you should have your foot above the brake pedal ready to stop when needed in an emergency as someone who also drives evs i still dont see this as an issue because anything other than something apearing right in front of you out of nowhere would make the difference and the moment you fully lift off its already applying max regen belts you apply friction brakes so it really doesnt seem like that big of a deal the problem is the drivers drivibg evs not evs themselves my dad is a good driver but for some reason once he gets into his tesla with all its cameras and sensors he basically completely relys on the car to do the work for him i will never be like this and only use the tech if its better than doing it myself like backibg up using the camera because theres significantly less visibility out the back than in the camera on our car but ill still use mirrors and such and base things off visual cues instead of what the car tells tells me
2024-04-13,Uvm-FxufxP8,userrm7kb3il6x the level of assistance from regen braking is minimal you also dont need one pedal driving or even regenerative brakes for that to work many nonregen european cars have had brake assist for years besides covering the brakes still applies to far more situations basically anytime youre in a parking lot anytime youre going through an intersection anytime you drive by pedestrians or parked cars or when the situation can immediately change it can be wise to cover your brake pedal
2024-04-13,Uvm-FxufxP8,userrm7kb3il6x one pedal braking is a technology it also makes you lazy and dependent
2024-04-13,Uvm-FxufxP8,userrm7kb3il6x i think driving around with a foot hovering in the air above the pedals is a very limited case situation most driving is done with a foot on one pedal or the other my tesla and my vw both have the ability to toggle between a low regen or high regen driving mode amusingly my former fiat had the blended brakes that he seems to prefer
2024-04-13,Uvm-FxufxP8,allentechpt9026 my tesla and my vw both have the ability to toggle between low or high regen braking on my model s it is on screen in a menu and on my vw it is on the gear selector my previous fiat had blended brakes with minimal regen outside of pressing the brake both the fiat and vw do not have the ability to turn off creep that mimics a gas cars inability to stop moving in gear so the braking also mimics a gas car tesla lets you turn off creep mode because an electric car is not a gas car i see a lot of accidents in beep and creep but in a tesla with autopilot the car will radar lock on the car in front and accelerate and decelerate to maintain the distance pretty reliably the important thing is to continue looking out the front window and keeping hands on the wheel and feet near the pedals and not watching a movie or playing video games instead i have seen people doing the most completely stupid things in cars in traffic since the 1980s long before there were evs i submit that many accidents in evs are caused because they have a 500 horsepower vehicle that accelerates very quickly and are not used to it thats also why tires get used so quickly my tesla needed new tires at 600000 miles and again 57000 miles later the drivers ed cars where i live are all teslas
2024-04-13,Uvm-FxufxP8,allentechpt9026 the level of assistance from regen braking is minimal if youve only driven hybrids like the volt sure but in any one pedal drive car like a tesla its going to slow down as if you were applying the brakes emergency stop no but plenty fast enough to cause an accident if the brake lights dont come on
2024-04-13,Uvm-FxufxP8,allentechpt9026 one pedal driving alone doesnt make you lazy it makes it easier yes but it alone isnt going to make you lazy and dependent look at manual vs automatics would you say automatics make you lazy and dependent well compared to a manual yes it does but its not the only factor in making evs more likely to crash
2024-05-06,Uvm-FxufxP8,as an experienced ev driver myself ive never had issue with one pedal driving you just learn how to feather the accelerator pedal in such a way that is comfortable to you eventually it is adaptive to muscle memory
2024-05-06,Uvm-FxufxP8,panemon187 it adapts quite quickly as well because youre doing it so often maybe on the 3rd drive it starts becoming easy it really isnt an issue for people who have actually used it
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,fiat created a new category under compact and sub compact known as circus
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,this car is a joke the bolt is a much better buy
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,i have a 23 bolt ev and a 2015 fiat 500e the fiat is much more fun to drive even feels quicker off the line
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,i like the car nice will just check it out on the leasing
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,interior needs to be white and it should be under 30k the gas of these car were under 20k
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,white interiors look like an apple store i cant stand them
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,and where would the motor go replace the boot
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,krane15 that is the trunk a boot you put on your foot
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,i just hate seeing a car that should be in the low 20k range priced out in the mid to high 30k range it is a limited use car urban errand runner i cant see spending that much when i can get eventually the xc30 for the same price
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,the msrp doesnt match the size and that was even truer for the original fiat 500e best to get them on lease if in ca where they handed those out like candy or to buy them used with a marked depreciation we purchased an off lease low mileage fiat500e for 10k which at that point made more sense
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,if they priced it rasonably they would have to make more which isnt the point of this car it only exists to comply with fleet requirements for manufacturers they want to sell as few as possible and use the limited battery available to sell 100k pickup trucks and suvs
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,no ev in low 20k all fantasy
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,rp9674 exactly even the ice version of the 500 is over 30k no wonder stelantis isnt selling cars right now
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,if they 2017 bolt was able to get 238 miles of range how is this only able to get 100 something i understand its a little shorter but the difference is startling good effort though
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,i think the bolt has a back seat thats actually usable so its a bigger car this fiat is really a two seater with a usable trunk when you fold down the rear
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,we wouldve killed for the chevy bolt in europe and only a very few opel amperas were imported before gm sold off opel and vauxhall to psa now stellantis
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,isnt this a compliance vehicle so they can continue to sell 100k pickup trucks and suvs
2024-04-11,Uvm-FxufxP8,compliance vehicles should be judged on its own merits still a vehicle
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,leasing a vehicle is the most expensive way to operate one facts are your friends
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,lease happens to qualify for ev tax credit which most lease companies pass on if you buy you need to comply with income limits to qualify for federal ev tax credits
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,for the poors yes but if you have the money its not like youre not getting any benefits and also some lease deals are too good to pass up like the current deal on ioniq 6s
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,thought its built in poland on their stellantis factory but smart people corrected me already turns out in italy good review
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,in california this car is a much better deal in the big cities than toyota mirai by driving which you might not find hydrogen for refueling due to closing broken out of order stations this one can be charged overnight even from a regular outlet
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,the answer to the question in the title is in your tfl studios the original fiat 500 bought to be as a cool decoration so if original can be a show off why new one shouldnt be used as a real city commuter
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,it was never a gas pedal what car is powered by gas
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,its not horse power either now how do you like those apples
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,love it its actually affordable and functional at the same time short range means less expensive and less charging time which is good for short trips which is what evs are good for
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,nevco8774that citroen ami is a joke this fiat 500 is a proper ev that doesnt lug around a huge expensive battery like a tesla nice charming ev maybe the only ev with charm
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,nevco8774lots of ugliness definitely agreeüòÇ
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,any car can make short range trips you dont need to spend 35000 on an affordable ev
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,nevco8774 who said anything about 23 year old car or clunkers 35000 is 2x the price of basically any new model subcompact ice car
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,nevco8774 there are many many decent ice cars for well under 35000 besides that setting decent as a standard when talking about a fiat is rather humorous
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,nevco8774 then why is any of this relevant to you
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,nevco8774 the gas version of the last generation fiat 500 was under 17000 now that the 500 is ev only its more than doubled in price
2024-04-10,Uvm-FxufxP8,allentechpt9026true the ice cars are cheaper but im speaking to those who look for an ev this would be the best ev because its small quick charging and doesnt carry a huge expensive battery for long trips evs in general should be for short daily driving and this 500 fits that category well
2024-05-13,Uvm-FxufxP8,nevco8774it might have a higher dc charge rate but since the bolt has a bigger battery charge times are about the same to get the equivalent of 100 miles in both
2024-01-25,Uc4h9AgdNqw,i like it i like the headlamps and the simple design of the car wish these were more popular in los angeles uber and los angeles need to make these robo taxis
2023-11-08,Uc4h9AgdNqw,i dont know if youre really short or if the car is really tall
2023-09-26,Uc4h9AgdNqw,i absolutely love fiats i live in the us my first car was a little red fiat and my second vehicle was a 2015 ev fiat i like them a ton because theyre just so weird and quirky but they do it in a way that is stylish i really want to continue owning a fiat even just as a secondary fun car but i feel like they really need to commit and find a niche to fill right now the entry level sub compact ev market is up for the taking its insane they dont capitalize on it like legitimately 52000 for any car that offers this range and level of materials etc is going to flop regardless of brand or design the chevy bolt here in the us has 270 miles of range at 27000 there is no way they are going to compete with that paying almost 200 more you still receive plastic molded interior less range and essentially just a different design language to top it all off fiat has no where near the support and repairability of something like chevy thats a big deal because getting them serviced will be annoying and too proprietary
2023-11-06,Uc4h9AgdNqw,52k is equivalent of 338k in usd but yeh its still way overpriced i think stellantis and many legacy automakers have deliberately overpriced their evs because they want to keep sales low and high profit as they certainly their ceo at least are clearly antiev and are intent on slowing down the transition away from ice cars as long as possible it simply cannot cost anywhere near the asking price to make a small 2 door car with a 37kwh battery and 87kw motor this strategy will ultimately backfire imo
2023-11-15,Uc4h9AgdNqw,fangitjoe youre not referring to former ceo marchionne are you he was antiev but died five years ago stellantis like most car companies knows electric is the future
2023-11-16,Uc4h9AgdNqw,apexerman1 tavares will say electric is the future on one day and say electrification is impossible on the next httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkaggr1mcqqy
2023-09-25,Uc4h9AgdNqw,this car is now being heavily discontinued in the uk it was far too expensive when launched and the new electric mini is likely to take the majority of sales in this category
2023-09-24,Uc4h9AgdNqw,i like everything except the headlights swap them for the proper full rounds and maybe touch up the grille shape and its perfect
2023-09-22,Uc4h9AgdNqw,im pretty sure if people are silly enough to spend that much on cars they dont question the hard plastics of the interior i dont know why australian car reviewers always mention it
2023-09-21,Uc4h9AgdNqw,way too expensive id prefer a tesla model 3 every day
2024-03-14,Uc4h9AgdNqw,thats more expensive than this car and repairs on that thing will be as insane
2023-09-21,Uc4h9AgdNqw,im review cars guys
2024-06-02,R-NFILq5hhA,tom i have enjoyed your content for many years now and yes you should have over 1m subscribers in order to achieve that however you likely need more content 2x or 3x per week with more variety comparison tests longterm vehicles etc and take advantage of martin let him share his feedback at the endcould be an interesting contrast to your own views also werent you supposed to buy a cadillac lyriq or similar ev was looking forward to hearing your decision
2024-06-03,R-NFILq5hhA,hard to pump out that kind of volume and keep the quality up martin does the occasional cameo thats it still thinking about an ev but waiting until fall now focusing on my daughters wedding
2024-06-02,R-NFILq5hhA,get a model 3 standard with the tax credit and it will cost the same have far greater range and be far far safer
2024-05-27,R-NFILq5hhA,bang for buck is way too low paying 34k for cute and attitude seriously reliability get a small real car from a real maker
2024-05-25,R-NFILq5hhA,its an extremely tough sell at 34000 this one is strictly for the die hard fiat fans
2024-05-25,R-NFILq5hhA,im convinced that prices will drop
2024-05-25,R-NFILq5hhA,shame because its such a cool car for the right use case but that price yikes
2024-05-20,R-NFILq5hhA,i like this car and believe it will sell well much better than the gas version or older e version we need more cars like this for the daily commuter
2024-05-20,R-NFILq5hhA,what this needed was a hybrid engine adding to the battery range imo more hybrids are needed in the mktplace
2024-05-17,R-NFILq5hhA,great alternative to the mini se and bmw i3 ev city cars for the win
2024-05-17,R-NFILq5hhA,this is the best looking electric car ever
2024-05-15,R-NFILq5hhA,at 34k this is only 6k less than a tesla model y which is probably 3 times the size with 300 miles of ev range
2024-05-13,R-NFILq5hhA,some of these are already seeing significant discounts making them serious contenders vs mini se your review is the best of any vehicle i have ever seen and incredibly engaging while providing all the ammo i need to sell it to my wife thanks for the presentation
2024-05-13,R-NFILq5hhA,everyone is lying to you tom surprised you have the subscriber count that you do quit whining about it
2024-05-12,R-NFILq5hhA,i mean the tesla model 3 will be eligible for the tax credit soon and then you can get a huge amount more car for less than 2000 more but sure it is cute
2024-05-11,R-NFILq5hhA,150 miles dang thats about the gas powered fiats lasted until repairs were needed üòäüòäüòä
2024-05-11,R-NFILq5hhA,cars im considering for next year this volvo ex30 and the mini se if they come out with a mini convertibledone deal
2024-05-11,R-NFILq5hhA,put a gas engine in it and i would buy it i love small hatchbacks
2024-05-11,R-NFILq5hhA,perfect city car hope cars like this get more popular
2024-05-11,R-NFILq5hhA,are americans ever gonna see the variety of evs or only the expensive in europe and asia you can buy evs starting at 10k
2024-05-11,R-NFILq5hhA,are you talking about the citroen ami its effectively an enclosed golf cart it would never pass american crash standards and americans would never buy anything that small or slow pretty much the same for any of those european cars even the chinese sourced ones that are under 25000
2024-05-11,R-NFILq5hhA,drivencarreviews renault peugeot vw bmw mercedes all kind of amazing lightweight city evs
2024-05-13,R-NFILq5hhA,drivencarreviewsa couple of weeks ago i saw an actual golf cart with a license plate on a suburban road
2024-05-11,R-NFILq5hhA,34000 what a ripoff not to sell limited range and just tiny maybe if sold at 19000 then might sell a few
2024-05-10,R-NFILq5hhA,i think the mini countryman se all4 will provide little more room and a longer body plus it looks nicer inside this 500e is too small for my taste in cars
2024-05-10,R-NFILq5hhA,the url for your quoting service is wrong drivenquotes vs quotesdriven
2024-05-10,R-NFILq5hhA,this is just as laughably bad as the original e500 worthless at any speed and please morons who buy this usually birdbrain shopaholic auto illiterate females who appreciate its ease of parking downtown do not have an accident i in one the other driver will survive but you sure as hell will not ps this is twice as expensive as such a pos should be
2024-05-10,R-NFILq5hhA,electric garbage the hybrid is much better and with the fuel efficiency it makes no sense to use this
2024-05-10,R-NFILq5hhA,fiat you berry phunnieüòÇ
2024-05-09,R-NFILq5hhA,the problem with all the european small electric car is too expensive where its cant compete with china made which cost a few grand
2024-05-09,R-NFILq5hhA,fiat has a terrible quality rating by numerous legitimate consumer groups buyer beware
2024-05-09,R-NFILq5hhA,the one disincentive to buying electric cars in places like the state of georgia they have an alternative vehicle fuel tax of 21087 a year if you dont drive that many miles per year this is a total ripoff and yet the governor claims he is trying to promote evs i have a gasoline powered fiat 500 abarth and the parts and the cost of running that car is almost nothing plus it only cost 17000 i fill up once a month 10 gallons
2024-05-09,R-NFILq5hhA,this car is too expensive you could buy a civic si with money to spare for the price of this thing
2024-05-09,R-NFILq5hhA,its too damn expensive this will cause its demise and fall like smart car i can buy tesla model y with this price
2024-05-09,R-NFILq5hhA,would be the perfect car to own for city driving for around 15k grand at over double that price its a no no car there is just too much thats far better in the used market for that money
2024-05-09,R-NFILq5hhA,awesome head the previous gen theyre a blast to drive
2024-05-09,R-NFILq5hhA,love this would love it more if they could shave 10k off the price thank you for todays video
2024-05-09,R-NFILq5hhA,im glad fiat is back in the game with a new 500 and this one is as cute as a button
2024-05-09,R-NFILq5hhA,i think fiat made a bad decision by not giving you a loaded version to review tom this is the only city car with level 2 autonomous driving its a traffic jam star
2024-05-09,R-NFILq5hhA,what is your opinion between this fiat 500 e and the mini cooper se
2024-05-09,R-NFILq5hhA,really like this car even though it doesnt meet my needs with a family but i would recommend it to a friend especially given the previous 500e was probably fiats most reliable car ever also thanks for not being bought by big charger most car reviewers say everyone has to get a level 2 but these city focused cars are well suited to be charged with a regular wall outlet since id bet the vast majority dont go more than 40 miles per day
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,cute but 35k and fiats perceived reliability just is a no go looking forward to see what sales figures on these end up being
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,thank you for reviewing a vehicle with the appearance and the size of a normal car not a humongous suv or a pickup truck as much as i like the 500 styling it is a very niche car probably will be great for downtown london or paris maybe for san francisco as well one third of new vehicle registrations in sf are evs but 35k fifteen years ago one could buy a subcompact for 15k returning 3035 mpg and keep extra 20k for movies and night clubs fiat itself stopped selling gasolinepowered 500 in the us bring back the old times ps tossible
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,i like your car reviews and your personal comments are
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,for 10k less you can buy a toyota corolla hybrid with more than double the range and probably double the residual value tom you really loose credibility when you pitch something like the 500e as a good city car if you put your ev bias aside youd have given this nothing but a big red light
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,the right tool for the job doug corolla hybrid isnt nearly as fun to drive harder to park and lacks personalty thats fine for many traditional buyers my bias is towards cars that nail their mission ice or ev i enjoyed my time in the 500e so did my passengers something i pay attention to value is different for every buyer ask anyone choosing between a tahoe and escalade
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,a city ev with decent charging and for a city ev very good range nice yes its small but ummmm city car missed the price and went back to the beginning for it 34k really there are a lot of used bolts and leafs out there seems like the price is gonna cause sales to be light i might be wrong i remember time tunnel james darren lee meriweather
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,bolt and leaf especially used are great values they lack the personality of the fiat some will pay for that
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,tom if you want 1233 a foldflat front passenger seat toyota will be happy to sell you one with their two door tacoma that has to be the craziest location for one in the whole industry
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,foldflat front passenger seat foldflat rear bench and a separately opened rear window 2003 toyota matrix imho one of the best compact cars ever
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,tinleadhammer as the owner of a 2005 pontiac vibe it is hard for me to disagreeüòâ on a serious note it is irritating to see features like the foldflat front seat and 402040 second row seats disappear from the industry
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,contrary to misinformation electric cars are becoming more popular tom voelk all is forgiven we all misspeak from time to time still a great channel and will remain a subscriber
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,043 that ghost of the exceo should go lie down and rot he singlehandedly stunted fiat for 8 years that survived mostly on 500 and panda revenue if not the massive that he aimed to be there wouldve been years more rd and this 500e couldve been achievable at the same price or less before 2020 isnt that not a problem
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,coming from ireland europe 157 absolutely fk bn btw he is an absolute pox who should not be associated in any good faith or light theres a lot of potential in the 500e it is unfortunately tailored as the familys fourth car to rival a mini it is unfortunately not accessible enough even as a 24kwh in eu there should me a 2832kwh battery option and definitely a 16kwh twinair rex it should come with a giardinia estate there should be a panda thats more practical and affordable based on the same architecture of the 500e
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,sweet little car
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,meeh just put back the gas engine in it
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,how can you not smile looking at this little thing when i visited rome two months ago 500s were everywhere and it really added to the ambiance im curious as to whether the fed tax credit for leasing is still factored in if you were to buy out the lease im a complete knob when it cones to leasing so i have no clue how that works
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,as a happy owner of two fiats id really like to see the company sell the 500e here as a mainstream product like the old 500 not drop special editions on us once or twice a year as they currently plan to do stellantis markets fiat here in the us as an upmarket brand but honestly if they brought vehicles here like the tipo and panda and positioned fiat as a hipper budgetfriendly alternative they could generate sales that would otherwise go to the likes of toyota and honda
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,its a fantastic car for city everyday useplus its an ev
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,i live in the uk and these are far from rare here the range is no issue for most i mean be realistic most usa commutes are 40 miles at most just plug back in when you get home like you do with your phone and youll be fine really hope this sells well for fiat
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,americans use their vehicles quite differently but yeah it would work fine for many singles and couples
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,fiat fix it again tomorrow
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,very nice looking car but only 149 miles not sure americans will pay that high price for a car that doesnt travel past 200 miles on a single charge
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,yup its for a specific buyer its not like fiat plans to move 100k in the us
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,drivencarreviews thats a great point didnt think about the volume they plan on selling
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,putting that new charger to work nice tom
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,stellantis probably doesnt expect big sales numbers with this 500e in the us they do sell well in europe where this car makes sense if you would drive in france a rav4 or rogue will feel too clumsy and big for parking spaces and small roads not to mention underground parking where a rav4 will curb the wheels and scrape the bumpers on the first go anyone who has been to paris or rome probably has seen what parking on a small street looks like also a small electric car has smaller car tax and sales tax which favors smaller economical cars to me 500e is part of fiats identity they make those smaller cars because even though it isnt profitable it marks the identity of the brand
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,the inly thing i hate is the 20mph thing lmao its too corny for meüòÇ this is coming from a dude whos owned 2 fiats i have ny limits too
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,fwiw my wife couldnt hear it kind of faint had a hard time micing it
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,i had a 2015 500e it only had like 80 miles of range if we had 150 it would have easily covered every single trip even for longer drives
2024-05-13,R-NFILq5hhA,yep same here but my chevy bolt has over 200 miles of range minus the fiat style for me range won out in the end
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,i agree with what others said about this compared to a new or even used new leaf or mini se ev when the 1st fiat 500e in 2014 chryslers chief executive sergio marchionne 500e famously said to an audience at the brookings institute i hope you dont buy it because every time i sell one it costs me 14000 im honest enough to tell you that if i recall correctly the 1st generation sold so poorly that fiat had to severely discount them 10k i have an acquaintance in soca who bought one for a commute that fit in its range and it was amazingly cheap to buy and drive back then at this price with this range even though it is a big improvement over the 2014 models 84 miles and lack of dealer network it looks to me like this is still a money losing proposition for fiat
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,insanely poor value its 414month vs 330month for tesla model 3 with 271 mile range what kind of a review is this hopefully the audience is smarter and does their own research
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,ill add a half dozen folks that asked about the fiat liked the fact that this was not a tesla and didnt blink at the price
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,i get that its cute but not a good value its worth about 25k given the competition i suspect fiat will be discounting heavily or perhaps they dont care since its a low production volume compliance car for them idk a used bmwi3 or late model 500e might be a better value
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,34000 is this fiat joke
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,drivencarreviews i know which one we will get first
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,beautiful car crazy that it took so long to come to our shores and we dont even get all the options in europe its got a beautiful panoramic roof great review as always tom
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,ive added this one to my subcompact ev listamazing
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,i have been watching you for years and enjoy your reviews hope your summer goes well how about a mini jcw
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,scuderia was able to retrofit a 200 mile battery pack into the old 500e why is the new pack small
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,cost bigger batteries cost a lot more also its a city car it doesnt need to go 300 miles on a charge
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,hey tom would it be more appropriate to suggest charging speeds in terms of miles of range per hour so a 120v wall outlet is 3 or 4 miles per hour and l2 closer to 30 miles people can then gauge that to how long they usually park overnight so maybe 3040 miles recharged daily on a wall socket its less daunting to think about that way imo
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,perfect ev for city commuters and tight parking my commute is 5 miles in la traffic and my workplace has free chargers
2024-05-11,R-NFILq5hhA,5 miles get an ebike
2024-05-18,R-NFILq5hhA,this cars ice brother couldve been bought in 2019 for 12000 here in europe that someone buying city microcar for 36000 usd finds it perfect tells us that we live in alternative universes
2024-05-18,R-NFILq5hhA,msjl6dlyep the most brainwashed and gaslighted people on the planet even on the flat earth üòâ
2024-05-18,R-NFILq5hhA,msjl6dlyou are absolutely right bro even a stupid leaf blower that costs 1295 at aldi in germany costs 3999 dollar at aldi in america
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,its about 7k too expensive before the tax credit on the lease if this was high20s plus the lease credit itd be unstoppable as a second or third car for a family 149 miles is plenty for the type of driving this will be used for
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,a city ev in a city where there are no places to chargeevery major city in the usa
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,some major cities have plenty of places to charge others well its coming and pretty quickly
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,not sure where you live but ive never had an issue even when i didnt have l2 charging still best to charge at home
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,congratulations on the level 2 charger at your home
2024-05-26,R-NFILq5hhA,to me having a l2 at home is a must for ev drivers
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,200 mile range and the previous generations convertible top would really tempt me with that top down youd probably be back around 140 mile range
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,i only drive 50 miles a month would love to have this car for 26500 great price
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,this is a fantastic car for city living hoping to see more smaller evs like this coming out soon great vid
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,if it was 28k and got 170 miles of range i think it would be a hit and its almost there they could knock the price tho at least
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,drivencarreviews wheres your evil twin to stand in for you
2024-05-09,R-NFILq5hhA,drivencarreviews oh my thats terrible maybe hes moved up here to canada
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,the leaf would be a better choice more room and range for the same price similar to the mini also which has more room and range and thus more utility
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,practicality is relative this can park in spaces the leaf cant also the leaf is hideousand if you really need more practicality and dont have children just remove the rear seats altogether then you have a microvan with even greater range due to the lightweighting
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,evs are dead long live hybrids
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,hybrids are dead long live evs
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,mrd5024 a few brands have slowed a bit other brands are selling record numbers overall ev sales are up and expected to keep going up along with this the adoption of wind solar and battery storage for the global electric grid is accelerating rapidly this is great news because how quickly we stop burning fossil fuels will determine how much food your great grandkids will have to eat for dinner
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,i want to see one in person so badly great review as normal tom i imagine we will see broll of you at home charger in ev videos moving forward üòÄ
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,city car is nonsense you know how gas cars always have a range of 300500 miles its not because thats the limit of how much gas it could hold they could double the tank capacity if they wanted to its not like a 30 gallon tank takes up that much space even in a compact vehicle they have that range because thats what people are comfortable with for the kind of car they buy so the gasoline range of a car could be said to be the ideal range for its segment and how much highway range does the gasoline fiat 500 have almost 350 miles
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,live with an ev and you might find 130 miles is plenty if charging at home its like having a gas station in your garage
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,as a current nissan leaf 40kwh user a range of around 149miles is enough for me couple that with the more common ccs1 plug this is going to sell a lot to urban commuters i like the mini se its also quirky looking like this fiat but the epa range is abysmall the next gen mini se is not that good looking as the fiat 500e too
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,i have a 2023 mini cooper electric and i get between 125 and 150 of range in the la area the range depends on how much freeway or street driving i do
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,an offlease leaf could be had for 12k the last time i checked 35k i dont think so
2024-05-09,R-NFILq5hhA,rogermartinez78 ive been to la and the traffic jams there arent as bad as where i live here its almost always a very slow stop and go traffic which means little regen braking thats why most people only get around 114 miles out of full charge coupled with astronomical pricing its 70k here my leaf is 41k and the base model ioniq 5 is 47k and that is if i can find the base model
2024-05-09,R-NFILq5hhA,tinleadhammer in the us yes but in my country here its 41k and no rebates though we do get free home charger discounted electricity rates and 25 road tax per year
2024-05-09,R-NFILq5hhA,hnrichard stop and go traffic is where evs like the mini cooper electric do great because of the strong regeneration like i said i get about 125 do 70 or more miles per hour
2024-05-09,R-NFILq5hhA,rogermartinez78 the stop and go traffic i was referring to is the 2 hour trip for a measly 15 mile trip here thats how bad the stop and go traffic is right here much worse than la im averaging 45kmkwh in that traffic
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,did you say 34k wha for what range 149miles
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,range is overrated even on road trips charging speed and efficiency are equally important if not more so on the other hand if the volvo ex30 comes out at the promised price point it would be a no brainer
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,davidmenasco5743plus what price quality brand value etc the original 500 was useless for long trips as the engine was underpowered and the car is so small anyway so range really is less of an issue for a car this small as for efficiency disappointing
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,some people spend 74k for a car that gets 14 mpg mustand gt 500 its what you are willing to spend for a car that meets your needs right if you need more range its probably best to move along
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,pilot9412 too each his own this car fits its niche really well
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,fiat thinks theres enough of you gullible yanks to buy the highly profitable release before offering more affordable trim and 24kwh thats already in europe
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,they want to decrease co2 in the city before everywhere else there will be a longer range option either on this car or one of their new models
2024-05-09,R-NFILq5hhA,agreed thats more than a little pricey
2024-05-28,R-NFILq5hhA,im fine with the range but i agree regarding the price
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,part of me says this is where the sweet spot for the ev world should beat least for now a city car with many applications i recently saw a clever device that turns street lamps into level 2 chargers widespread avail of charging combined with an under 20k price could give life to this category
2024-05-17,R-NFILq5hhA,tell me more about the device that turns street lights into l2 chargers
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,question i am seeing the display is showing mpge does it have anywhere showing mikw why not my old 2016 500e has that mode available for mikw and a sunroof the dc fast charging is enticing i cant wait if they will come with the usa abarth love those scorpions sounds like the music is castelnuovotedescoheifetz figaro played it once for school great video
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,yeah its cute but a tad pricey at 34k especially so when you consider the huge inevitable depreciation hit
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,this car has a resting bitch face imo and i love it wish i were rich enough to own a second car
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,great review this really is the first ev ive ever found appealing one red light mention should have been the charging time 37 hours how does that compare to the industry average if honda brings their e car to the states that will be real competition
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,the 37 hours is using a 120v wall outlet from 5 and its actually a terrible metric more usefully is to think of it in terms of 4 miles of range for every hour on a wall outlet or 30 miles hour using a 240v wallbox charger
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,looks beautiful really nice design with vw canning the beetle it really helps the fiat 500 especially in europe seeing fiat 500s always reminds me of a friend who had one 15 years ago told me that while they were driving the drivers seat electric motors went crazy and started crushing her into the steering wheel no harm done but im wary of stellantis and electrics
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,she probably hit a button that caused the seat to go forward to allow people into the back and didnt realize it
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,nice little car but not at that price 28k would be good with tesla and ford dropping their ev prices its hard to lease or pay at msrp given the high depreciation of evs
2024-05-08,R-NFILq5hhA,a base tesla model 3 is 39k kia niro ev can be had for the same why on earth would anyone buy this thing
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,it definitely looks bad thats for sure cant believe that thing is the chargers distant cousin lmao
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,not even worth 30000 pesos or 30000 nickels
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,fiat has completely lost their minds someone actually had to approve this mess
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,thats like probably 15k car asking for double is a crime for humidity
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,you can buy a chevy trax for the same price better than this ugly fiat
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,one cup holder cause they deff single driving that lol
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,wow the new fiat pusse is amazing
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,bro could sell you a car in two minutes and regret laterüòÇüòÇ
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,i have a 2010 kia soul with no drivers visor mirror you can tell auto makers are cheaping out when they dont include things like that i understand that its a cheap car so its not that big of a deal but 34k for a vehicle with no drivers visor mirror thats taking it to far
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,34k for a car that cat hold 4 grown men no frunt trunk and can only go a quarter of what my 4runner can go thats some bs
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,fiat is crap
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,i remember about 10 years ago you could buy a vw polo for about 10k my goodness car manufacturers these days
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,for 19k 100hp and 140miles range and no mirror im sure it wont sell
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,34000 just buy a golf at that point if you want a small car üò≠a little bigger sure but much better all around
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,the car doesnt even seem worth 19k
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,whats the worst part about italian cars their electrics
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,you could buy a hyundai elantra n for this kind of money and thats a car thats actually fun to drive
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,im convince there trying to go bankrupt or something whos buying that car seriously
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,i cant believe im saying this but this car is actually worse than a tesla
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,yo bro can u review the abarth that has a scrpion logo
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,i worked in the service department at a chrysler dealer that serviced these they are the worst battery dies faster than expected when dead it locks up and essentially cant be moved and it falls apart with poor quality just for no parts to ever be available from italy
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,thats not a car it is a golf car
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,i like bitcoin over fiat to be honest
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,fiat is a cheaply made brand it will remain üòÇ decent looks but chocolate tray quality
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,uhh why is there a mopar logo in the front trunk
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,that company should just quit while they still have their dign never mind
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,the price is the kick in the teeth we actually really need a no frills ev like this but it needs to start at about 55 60 of the cost of this car
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,there is a second hand market full of good practical cars for less than 20k
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,italian electrics üòÖ
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,horrible quality who buys these cars
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,neither heat nor ventilated sounds like a cool feature when he says it üòÇ
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,when its electric all practicality is gone its trash
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,thats a weekend car here in saudi every time me and my friend go out he uses my leg as his armrest
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,even if it was 19k it wouldnt be worth it at that point just buy a much better 1020k gas car
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,carlo abarth is rolling in his grave
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,40k for a battery pack on wheels nahhh
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,same price as a hyundai venue yet worse
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,never buying a fiat
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,total waste of a car
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,these manufactures getting out of control consumers gotta take the power back one day
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,30k can also get me a list of cars that also cost that much someone help me name a few
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,117mph is tbh alot for a little car but im sorry over 30k on a car that is well kown for devaluing dramatically
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,for the price yes its very bad
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,this will be unreliable at the electrical level üòÇ
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,literally how is fiat still afloat as a company
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,for like 3k more you can get a corolla hybird a sedan that better than this in every possible way also not made by fca
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,ew that gear selector is disgusting the range is ugly and that price range is disgusting id be fine with it if it made that amount of power but had alot of range
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,fiat on crack
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,he roasted that car in every way possible as an indian i have always been jealous of us cars variety they got for much kesser price but this time i am relieved bcoz for 34k before taxes i can buy a xuv 700 topend luxury line suv with below feautures 1 heated ventilated nappa leather seats 2 7 seater with captain seats in the middle 3 petrol or diesel engine with almost 200hp power upto 480nm of torque 4 huge bmw like touchscreen with android auto carplay 5 level 2 adas with drive assist anti coalition breaking 6 8 airbags with 5 star global ncap 7 jbl sound system which is awesome
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,at 34 grand you can get a hyundai kona ev which has more range more space more amenities and a better design and it isnt a fiat
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,probably the dumbest car i have seen so far
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,thats not a car ya want to be in if you were in a crash
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,35000 dollars to drive around in a bloody tampon typicalüôÑüôÑüôÑ
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,this is officially the worst new car of 2024
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,34k for that little go cart lol üôâüôâüôâüôà
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,better off getting an ebike for 2000 then getting this car for 19000 considering only 149 miles of range
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,ah yes an electric car from a car company known for electrical issues what can go wrong
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,so smooth when he said cloth seats that are neither heated or ventilatedlol
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,but why tho the body looks like a repurposed regular fiat 500 body too its not like they created a whole new platfrom for the electric model for it to cost that much money
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,the funny part about this is that i think that this is the only fiat car forrest has reviewed so far and fiat aint leaving that much of a good impression
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,the fact this car exists exposes the possibility of a new auto industry bailoutwhy because the new government regulations are requiring car makers to phase out gasoline engines thus in the future when cost of maintenance and replacement of batteries catches up with the electric vehicle owners battery degradation ridiculous labor costs non selling vehicles rotting on the dealer floor the government will put together a bailout with our taxes to pay for the losses due to their bright idea
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,aw yes an ev from a company known for electrical problems genius
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,even 19k was high af
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,you can get a model 3 for that price
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,what a joke of a car 34k for a car that is slow only has 140 miles range with an interior that has more plastic than a kia soul
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,34k for this is beyond a joke fiatchrysler not learning from their mistakes hence being the bottom of the automotive industry for decades
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,good car except for that e part
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,34k for fiat in the middle
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i wouldnt buy it alone just because of that deranged christmas chime and no vanity mirror how dare you fiat
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,no heated seats and it reminds me its a fiat ill take 10
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,not even worth 15k
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,its absolutely bonkers that this car cost as much as my elantra n oh boy üòÇ
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,damn no mirror so you cant even reflect on your bad decision to purchase the car
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,if you buy this car your a freaking goober gooober üò§üò°
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,for that much i can get the new mini cooper se which has 200 hp and 300 miles of range and its the same price but it comes with a glass roof standard
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,thats a good and funny review of a car thats barely equipped
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,my friend won one of these to drive for a year for free he never drove it and just took his old vw
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i need help becoming a car reviewer could you help me become one
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,a red golf cart
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,its funny how fiat as a company owns ferrari a company that makes masterpieces but also makes this a horrid car that no one wants to buy
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,or an old lexus with 40k miles that youll get 400k out of
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,why does the fiat brand even exist anymore
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i thought they closed in the us there total junk and i dont think ive ever seen a dealership
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i can understand an msrp of 5k even still id be willing to pay 1k for it max take it or leave it
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,but then again the mitsubishi mirage only has 78 horsepower connected to a 12 liter turbocharged 3 cylinder
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,fiats over the top they stopped the 500x for that
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,if you live in a very busy city this car is for you
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,fiat really want to dissapear from american market
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,who the hell would buy a car for 34k yet it has absolutely little or no features and its just terrible
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,this new fiat is available since 2020üòÇ
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,its a fiat so despite being electric itll find a way to send piston 3 to the moon
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,sooo fiat continues to make gross and terrible cars just buy a mini cooper
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,this car doesnt make any sense
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,why would anyone buy a fiat 500 anyway
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,there are people that will buy that instead of tm3 because it has apple car play

2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,19 thousand dollars not even the most italian idiots would be buying that fiat rather stick to a very old combustion from the 60s
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,at least this car has more storage space than aventador üòÇüòÇ
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,as a die hard fiat fan this breaks my heart üò¢
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,bro yall in the us are getting scammed my family got the convertible version years ago and it is faster has more mileage and it is cheaper than this but i do live in italy so the importation isnt a concern
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,in texas this car will not even cover your commute nonsense chevy bolt has 250 mile range come on

2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,okay but wheres the fiat v8 muscle car
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,34k and only 149 miles of range not worth it all you can get you can het a hybrid accord and 500 miles of range for 34k smh
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,here where i live the fiat cost almost 45k
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,it aint even worth the 19k or 30k
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,since fiat didnt finish cooking this car you cooked them instead
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i cant even say what i actually want to say without youtube blocking me from commenting again 19hrs
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,unless you really love the new fiat 500 there are a good amount of used evs that can be found under 30k and there are also many that can be found under 25k to get that federal rebate as well just make sure electric fits your lifestyle of course but this fiat doesnt make any sense

2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,terrible car how does this company make any profit who is buying these are they just entirely subsidized by volkswagen at this point
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,in the uk we have the mg4 which is 10x better than this crap
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i so understood this car for 19k then the truth came out and it made no sense
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,oh hl naw 34000 for 117hp with under 150 mile range and its a base model can we say price gouging
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,this car was not designed for the american marketnot only that but there are better evs for the price
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,that car needs to stay on the dealership lot or never get delivered to the dealership period
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,forest i have a challenge car for you a 2009 mercury mariner
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,34k a nissan leaf or equinox ev is way better than

2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i mean it looks cool but the price should be more comparable to the nissan leaf
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,sounds like fiat needs a good wake up call with bankruptcy cause wtf even is this
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,this car is literally 10 years too late 100ish mile range expensive price tag no frunk no frills this is giving me first gen nissan leaf electric focus electric golf vibes
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,this was a compliance vehicle built to dominate the ev market circa 2017
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,just the fiat name is enough to ignore it
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,a cute runabout for the city fiat fans might like it at least it has android auto and apple car play a mini electric or kona electric are likely a lot better around the same price teslas model 3 isnt much more expensive too
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,what if im drunk driving and i go to change the radio station and accidentally put it in reverse at 30mph and crash
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,even 19k seems a bit much for this heap of junk
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,34k i bought a byd yuan plus in m√©xico for around 40k its a crossover suv that seats 5 has a range of over 400km and has self driving capabilities

2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,dang he really played us with the price üò≠
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,you can fucking keep it at that price fixitagaintoni
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,anybody who buys a fiat is a victim of scamming
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,34k for the bare minimum of an electric car no thanks
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,34k for this sht are they psychopaths i can buy a used luxury car in good shape for this price
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,hey i made a video on my car based off your video making style
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,we agree that its a bad car but i dont know why i see it on roads
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i pray a japanese manufacturer makes an electric compact car we need more small evs and less gargantuan evs which is like 90 of all evs on the market
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i love the critiques alongside the features ima pass
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,instant torque on a hatchback would be nuts also is this the first electric hatchback
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,comradebraixen leaf has no hp and is a eco car that can atleast be a fast hatch focus is also a eco car
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,just buy an old fiat panda from 2012 that will last more time than you on this earth
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,the only downside is price small cheap city cars without a ton of luxury features are very needed right now in the us
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,that price is a rather egregious and glaring downside we are moving in the other direction putting tariffs on chinese offerings
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,if they were needed they would exist the fact that manufacturers are killing their cheap city cars off left and right would seem to suggest that no one actually wants them
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,the whole car is a downside no range no speed no storage even at 19k would still be a rip off could get so much more üòä
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,you couldnt pay me to drive that lmao
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,why fiat as a company exists
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,even if its 19k its still more expensive than the chinese versions which are better
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,this was the most unbiased review ive ever seenüòÇ
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,this is the most base model base model electric car i jave ever seen
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,might just be the worse electric car i rather ride my ebike üòÇ
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,fiat prices are out the roof even in europe they sell cars for the same price in every country and make no deals
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,if forrest doesnt like a car it must be really really bad
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,30k for 100 hp and 140 miles of range üò≠ my v6 dodge challenger does better in every way
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,should have called it the fiat sike
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i could get a quality used car for 19k üòÇ
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i was in italy last month and they were pretty popular but in europe those small car are super popular but i am surprised about the price its too much
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,never have i seen a modern car without heated seats 30k is wild
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,34k for any fiat is too much
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,you have to be a certain type of special to buy that car üòÇ
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,you can get a 500 abarth that makes more power with a manual that gets about 33mpg out of a 105 gallon tank which is about 3465 miles of range for a quarter of the price
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,hysterical he didnt even mention that he wasnt sitting up straight because i think his man but wouldve hit the roof
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,for that money you can buy porsche carrera 20 years old that looks sounds and drives awesome
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i often wonder what drugs these car manufacturers are on when they make these braindead decisions
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,34k you could buy a korean hybrid with vastly better range power build and features
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i think the adjustable console rest is the worst thing to become standard in modern vehicles
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,if that was under 20k that would be the perfect city car
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,a hyundai tucson cost 40000 and it has way more than anything that excuses for a car offers
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,sooo basically just buy a model 3 or save some money and buy a nissan leaf which isnt much bigger and even that has better range
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i dont usually comment but bringing back the previews is a w
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,id wait for lets say 5 years for the fiat effect to kick in and buy it for 5k but the abarth exist
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,lol 30k might as well buy a used tesla do product owners not even consider competition when theyre building these cars
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,fiat asking to go under with this one
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,surprised america got this late but fiat has always asked alot for very little search up mg4xpower my dear yanks

2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,atleast fiat is written in the seats
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,yeah seat covers will solve that
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,even my grandma hates it thats a problem
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,this car should be considered a war crime
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,italy skated after ww2 now is time for the day of reckoning
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,a joke of a carstelantis just aint serious
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,149th comment just like its range that wont even take you to the neighboring stateüò≠
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,they make garbage gas vehicles so the electric vehicles will be worst
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,lol fiat trying to scam people at daylight in front of everyone üòÇ
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,id be embarrassed to say i work for fiat man wth is this 34k with a rebate i can get tesla üòÇ
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i would consider it if it started at 19k but at 34k id just get a ford maverick hybrid and id get all of the utility for less money while getting 40mpg city
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,the only demographic i could see them targeting with this vehicle is rich people with more money than they have in braincells üòÇ
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,and you not getting heat pump or battery thermal management
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,petrol engine coming in 2025 plus the abarth version is pretty cool
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,the leaf is better than this and it sells for like 22k starting and there are incentives on it makes more power than this same range and overall very reliable and proven platform why would you pay as much as a leaf plus w options for less than a base model leaf gives you
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,its not bad or is it this is the moment forrest auto reviews became vsauce auto reviews üòÇ
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,can you review a 2016 skoda octavia please

2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,fiat is like the nintendo of cars
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,that pause after the range üòÇ
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,fait has unfortunately become the cheap build and high price car so many great options besides them
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,tata nexon ev
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,this the cheapest build car ive ever seen straight out of made from china
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,why is jordan peele trying to sell me a car
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,so for like 1020k you can get a second hand honda civic or a toyota corolla that will have more features and get you wherever you need to go or you can spend 19k on car that barely has any features and is only meant for driving in city but it doesnt matter because its an ev so youre saving the environment
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,lol fiats have been like this for a long time89 years ago my gf wanted a fiat panda but the young trim which is the lowest end sold for 18000 for the same price she got a lancia ypsilon with custom paint and a proper infotainment system they are overpriced unreliable and do not fit a standard human being i cannot drive those tiny cars or ill press 2 pedals at once
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,no one should ever buy a fiat ever
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,thats a useless car
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,fiat lost their mind 30000
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,ugliest car ever made and its terrible üòÇ
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,nobody is buying that not when you can get a tesla model 3 that will blow that fiat out of the water
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,damn you could get a bolt for that price
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,hmmmm i prefer my hyundai getz especially first gen
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,yeah this car is a huge dub
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,2kg onion 5kg rice 3kg potato salt sugar i am writing this so everytime someone likes this i get reminded to buy this
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,its literally like 95 plastic and has only like 140 miles of range its terrible truly its worth it to spend just a bit more on a model three
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,if this was a attempt to keeping alive the fiat 500 name well they didnt try at all
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,a bad design for a gear selector
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,ya at 19 it screams cheap little run around town car that could be a big hit despite the lack of feature 34 is a hard pass
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,i saw someone mentioning the car is just to showcase the company is making ev and offset the bad fuel issue they have until they make a good ev
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,greattaiwanits really just the cost for me 99 of people wanting a car would never consider this
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,you cant just hit us with that absurdity so many times in a row we cant get a break
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,whenever this guy reviews a car it makes it seem fancy
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,man you should also review vans too there isnt really anyone who does it
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,the new fiat 500e isnt that bador is it vsauce theme starts playing
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,wouldnt buy this for 10k and lifetime free charging
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,the fiat executive team should spend a semester at the china state university
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,fiat enough said
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,dude said the car is not worth it a thousand nice ways
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,this car would be good if it retailed for 11k
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,not even bruh
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,evs are expensive they tried to make it as cheap as possible
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i could deal with the low hp because its enough for an economy car it probably has decent acceleration but the range is too low anything less than 200 miles makes this a car for local driving only
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,100 mile range and the price is more than 30k yeah no thank you
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,if being catfished was a car
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,just get an older fiat 500 cheap and the same hp
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,uzzie88 i agree even for 19k its still not worth it
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,tommasol9701 bullshit man üòÇ in india the owners of jag and lr tata motors is pumping out evs for less than 10k which look and are better than whatever the hell this car is
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,uzzie88whats even more insulting is the fact that its the base model and its that expensive with so little features so little as to not even having visor mirrors
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,its to expansive for that little power and range
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,sheawnv5724huh the video said 149 miles of range for 19000 where did you hear 100 miles of range for 30000
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,same problem as the now defunct honda e too expensive not enough range not enough room for america
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,at least that one looked really cool had honda quality and had a massive display with tons of features not the case here üò¢
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,forrestsautoreviewsofficial was really sad to see it go even if we never got it in america it was the spiritual successor to the honda city turbo ii dead before honda could make another motocompo to put in the trunk the 500e looks good at least to me and i love the color options but everything else
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,34k makes sense because fiat quality üòÇ
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,impressive that they managed to cram so much msrp into such a featureless package
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i owned a fiat 500 worst car i ever owned stuff would randomly break non stop things that would never break on much older american cars that i owned
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,webchamp930my best friend girlfriend owns a 500l she always says how much she hates that car its always at shop im telling her get a 24 trax and call it a day
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,webchamp930 the worst fun car ive owned only got it up to around 60k miles before it totally stopped working ive never spent so much time and money fixing a car in my life
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,officialcatdetector same here i owned till about 60k miles stuff would literally just fall off what a piece of junk it was known as fix it again tony i dont think that ever changed only good thing was i got a decent price on it when i traded it in from my tesla i will never ever get one again
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,34 grand for this is a joke who is the target audience its small slow no range and expensive as hell i am genuinly asking who would buy this if you have 34 grand for a base model you can just go with 40k and get something waaay better and electrical
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,rich quirky and single young people living in the city that need a car and have somewhere to charge it so basically 47 very insufferable people
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,tastethedifferencecheese why would i buy a jaaaaaaaaag i can just walk into the dealership ask for a test drive and take it home
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,gundam4president even those people would buy a corean eletric instead
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i bought my tesla model y for 36k this car is a joke at best smh
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i got a 2013 hyundai genesis coupe premium 2t no mods at the time üòõ with 37k miles for 12k and that thing is so fun to drive ive only bought used cars my girlfriend will only get brand new cars and paid like 30k for a brand new elentra bc she was convinced that used cars are bad but after she went with me to buy my genesis she changed her mind so im guessing they are marketing to the people that will only buy new cars no matter what
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,the secret is that there is no target audience its just a compliance car so stellantis can pretend its doing something to offset its horrendous fleet fuel economy figures until its actually decent evs arrive sometime next year
2024-06-04,OSvuSISisD8,devonsherwood not really a red flag she just wasnt educated on it ive been with her for 7 years and i just purchased my genesis so she saw how i did it and she changed her mind
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,its a fiat its garbage
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i wouldnt buy it even for 19k üòÇüòÇ
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,it was even fed up at the beginning just look at its face üòí
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,i wanna know who would spend 34k on this vehicle
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,rental car companies a fiat 500 only makes sense when it is cheaper to rent than take taxis or ride shares while on a low budget business trip
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,they are going to sit on the lot for several months and accumulate dust to the point where dealers are forced to lower the price
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,xeqtrm1 fiats are likely made to last in europe in the us they break easily ive seen them on the road like toyota camrys here in the states when i visited italy back in 2008
2024-06-03,OSvuSISisD8,joeygalileohotto oh i didnt know but ill never buy a fiat like ever
