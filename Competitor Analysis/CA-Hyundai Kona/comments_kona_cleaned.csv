2024-07-16,-GYjfh1gpkM,shifter is cheap looking and over sized so pus it turns the wrong way
2024-07-03,-GYjfh1gpkM,i think youll find its pronounced hyundai
2024-06-23,-GYjfh1gpkM,lol all these bts references were fun hahaha
2024-06-22,-GYjfh1gpkM,i work at hyundai and im not an ev fan at all but we use a kona electric as our service shuttle and holy hell theyre so fun to drive so smooth and comfortable drive too and so much torque
2024-06-01,-GYjfh1gpkM,is rear seat can contains 3 adults comfortably
2024-05-06,-GYjfh1gpkM,what happened to their design team looks like the same people who designed the ssangyon rodius bad bad bad people
2024-03-22,-GYjfh1gpkM,i dont get the price of this car top trim is 45k tesla 3 rwd is 39k with bigger battery more efficient matrix led headlights charges way faster has a panoramic sunroof bigger trunk its own charging network and a router ev planner with ev charging stops automatically calculated
2024-03-08,-GYjfh1gpkM,does anyone ordered the new long range kona recently is the  218hp electric motor with 654 kwh battery still available i ordered a new kona in romania and only the 204hp and 648kwh configuration is available
2024-02-11,-GYjfh1gpkM,its unfortunate that the exterior is so ugly as the drivetrain and interior are substantially improved
2024-02-10,-GYjfh1gpkM,cool review also  why does the reviewer look like jennifer aniston from the 90s
2024-02-08,-GYjfh1gpkM,does it support bi directional charging
2024-02-07,-GYjfh1gpkM,nothing said about the quality of the mechanicals the subframe the gearbox the electric motor the paint quality
2024-02-04,-GYjfh1gpkM,i went to view a kona yesterday and i really like it as a kia owner i was tempted by the niro ev but i like the kona much better both inside and out i am not currently an ev driver and still wondering if this is the way forward
2024-01-20,-GYjfh1gpkM,so you didnt actually answer the question in your title thats frustrating is it better than the niro ev or not
2024-01-18,-GYjfh1gpkM,hyundai havent made the traction control better  instead theyve just dropped torque from 395nm to only 255nm
2024-01-18,-GYjfh1gpkM,"i have a 2021 kona electric ultimate to buy it now its almost 4k more and the battery is no better and even then you need to add 3k worth of option packs to get a top spec
hyundais avarice means i wont be buying another kona its a shame as i love my kona and have gotten over 300 miles repeatedly"
2024-01-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,rental giants hertz and sixt have both dumped teslas  indeed all evs   citing cost of repairs being high enough that it significantly impacted earnings
2024-01-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,how come you did not talk about the 100 pounds of torque this new model lost 
2023-12-26,-GYjfh1gpkM,yes the heat pump costs 900 on the niro ev but the price of the top spec niro is about 800 less than the top spec kona so its not so much of a difference
2023-12-23,-GYjfh1gpkM,complaining that the steering wheel blocks the display but cant you just adjust the steering wheels tilt to be able to see the screen better
2024-02-11,-GYjfh1gpkM,yes but the visibility depends on driver height and many people may have no issues
2023-12-08,-GYjfh1gpkM,the interior design looks super nice and clean which is appealing and i think it spent money where you want it spent i dont care if that part of the door panel is cheap im resting my elbow on it  the screen set up looks great clear and easy to use on the move i am amazed some other model systems are even legal eg volvo xc30 where everything is done through a massive touch screen im not allowed to hold my mobile but its perfectly fine for me to play around on that while flying down the motorway for me it would have to be the longer range version but that pushes it into that high tax bracket an additional 390 pa for 5 years is crazy even for evs ive driven a petrol nline and really enjoyed it even that was quiet so i expect to hear my own heart beat it this one  i think how hyundai are designing their line up is very clever perfectly positioned to cover ice demand but establishing themselves as a clear midrange high quality ev manufacture
2023-12-06,-GYjfh1gpkM,955 high beam assist
2023-11-22,-GYjfh1gpkM,hyundai will find it difficult to sell the new kona the kia niro just looks so much better
2023-11-12,-GYjfh1gpkM,er 3rd generation
2023-11-11,-GYjfh1gpkM,this car has not spare tireif you got a flat tire you will be a big trouble am not recommending this car
2023-11-09,-GYjfh1gpkM,"ive firstly  ever  heard proper pronunciation of hyundai in english accent that means modern times d
godai  ancient times
jungdai medieval times"
2023-11-05,-GYjfh1gpkM,im a toyota worshiper but their full ev is a huge disappointment this just might be my next car job well done hyundai
2023-10-29,-GYjfh1gpkM,horrible omg
2023-10-28,-GYjfh1gpkM,ugh the rear window is still a dust magnet my biggest gripe with my ver1 2018  kona ev
2023-10-28,-GYjfh1gpkM,hope they sort the battery issues my 2023 dis 545 miles before needing replacement 9 months later waiting for replacement handed it back 
2023-10-26,-GYjfh1gpkM,you missed the real first edition of the kona
2023-10-13,-GYjfh1gpkM,looking forward to seeing this come to the us where there is a growing rival between new ev like the 2024 kona and tesla the big difference may be which ev is cheaper as tesla is made in america thus eligible for the full 7500 tax credit where hyundai is not as its made in s korea base tesla y models may actually turn out to be cheaper than the kona ev after tax credits are added into the price stay tuned
2023-12-08,-GYjfh1gpkM,that will be interesting in the uk incentives for purchasing evs are disappearing so now credit and 0 road tax will end in 2025  there will be some petrol vehicles that pay lower road tax than an ev if that tax credit goes the same way and has a deadline tesla are in trouble from rival manufacturers importing to us
2024-01-24,-GYjfh1gpkM,dont forget warranty tesla 4 year hyunday 5 year kia 7 year
2023-10-12,-GYjfh1gpkM,nice design and i love kpop     regards from greece
2023-10-10,-GYjfh1gpkM,i have no idea how to pronounce hyundai but i can guarantee its not like this 
2023-10-06,-GYjfh1gpkM,pity its so ugly
2023-10-04,-GYjfh1gpkM,a ba hair off 200cm
2023-10-04,-GYjfh1gpkM,40k thats 7k more than my present two year old kona ev 64kw cost from new and double what my car is now worth according to insurance company i think ill wait a few years once tesla has its reported 25k model on the road
2023-09-30,-GYjfh1gpkM,59ft please convert to the almighty metric system
2023-09-26,-GYjfh1gpkM,lol they hit their audience perfectly with the kpop reference all those fans years ago are getting old enough and getting enough economy to buy a car
2023-09-26,-GYjfh1gpkM,old one looks better
2023-09-24,-GYjfh1gpkM,us owner i loveit
2023-09-21,-GYjfh1gpkM,hyundais ioniq line of evs could seriously do with a more streamlined little less over futuristic design    the previous first generation now discontinued hyundai kona os 4wd  16 tgdi i4 5dr compact csuv rhd looks way better than the new one as showcased in this video   
2023-09-19,-GYjfh1gpkM,why no one tell a word about car multimedia what about car speakers
2023-09-19,-GYjfh1gpkM,any idea if it has the adaptive drivers display like the niro where is shows the weather etc
2023-09-18,-GYjfh1gpkM,where is this shot
2023-09-18,-GYjfh1gpkM,too busy design styling  ugly  to me
2023-09-18,-GYjfh1gpkM,"gear change is not traditionally placed on a steering wheel stalk so not sure why you claim that theres already wireless mobile phone charging in the previous version of the kona along with the space for water bottles and oh yeah a massive cubby bin too may want to go revisit the old version then redo this video  and this is me only 3 minutes into the video too 

disclaimer i drive the 2023 model kona"
2023-10-04,-GYjfh1gpkM,yeh thought that was a bit strange my kona ev has plenty space in the front and i particularly like the shelf under the console
2023-09-18,-GYjfh1gpkM,i think the exterior looks great interior looks horrific and dated imo like an old vcr style or something just looks plasticky and nasty looks several steps backwards from the ioniq 5
2023-09-17,-GYjfh1gpkM,its a kona and a last makes a cup of fresh coffee 
2023-09-17,-GYjfh1gpkM,the old kona was faster i had it for 2 years
2023-09-15,-GYjfh1gpkM,that central dash is horrific looks pre gen imo
2023-09-18,-GYjfh1gpkM,it really does i thought i was the only one that thought so everyone else seems to love it for some reason but its horrific enough to put me off and go with a niro instead even if this has more kit
2023-09-15,-GYjfh1gpkM,the bts book cracked me up 
2023-09-15,-GYjfh1gpkM,this was a french car i think the hybrid one i saw had a black headlining with cheaplooking black cloth upholstery not chic depressingwhy do manufacturers suddenly want uk drivers to drive in the dark renault and now peugeot 3008 please note
2023-09-15,-GYjfh1gpkM,10  80 in 40min is a no buy 
2023-09-15,-GYjfh1gpkM,aahh the old robocop 
2023-09-15,-GYjfh1gpkM,who is going to use these speeds what about safety visibility from a pedestrian aspect value for money
2023-09-15,-GYjfh1gpkM,lol the centre console i like what you did with the book
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,front looks ok the back end unfortunately is hideous and not keen on the interior looks cheap the outside lights are awful
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,lower it 30mm and id even live with the front charge port maybe
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,love the buttons on the inside the charge port on the front is a major fail they should hide the charge port
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,seems to be priced a bit on the high side for a compact car
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,"this question is like is drowning better than hanging

two ghastly milk floats"
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,traditional gear shift on the wheel yeah if you still live in the 50s
2023-09-26,-GYjfh1gpkM,yes exactly traditional
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,seems like a nice car probably a bit overpriced compare to rivals
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,have a car manufacturers stopped making ice cars i know its hard to believe but some of us cant own electric cars i have on street parking so no home charger and very little infrastructure in my town for charging electric cars it would be nice if we were catered for come on what car how about some nonplugin hybrids
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,but the front that is so ugly so wired must primaere be made for china they like that robotface
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,evsbatteries are too big too heavy too expensive and much of their energy is used lugging them around it appears we are 4 to 5 years away from solid state batteries which just might bring a reduction in weight increased range shorter charging times and maybe cheaper ev prices the sooner the better
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,hyundai have a knack for making cars which just look ugly and weird and this car is no exception those rear headlights look bizarre slung low on the sides like some kind of legally mandated afterthought the inconveniently asymmetric front charge port is bizarre the sharp lines combined with bulges looks odd its uncanny how they manage this almost every time the original ioniq and even the ioniq 5 look fugly too i was behind an ioniq 5 the other day and it looks so dated and trying too hard to be futurist and failing for a car which has only been out a couple of years
2023-09-18,-GYjfh1gpkM,i love the ioniq 5 personally but holy cow this is horrific despite having less kit i would get the niro over this simply because of the 90s dash in this monstrosity
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,"nice review

any detail on some of the functions that reset on shutting down the v1 car
i have to have a predrive routine of turning on the autohandbrake and turning off the lane departure  they always reset themselves

also any memory seats available now"
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,on the highest trim level you get the lounge seats with memory function now
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,i like the new presenter model i also think  why go with a niro now
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,cos its a better car 
2023-09-17,-GYjfh1gpkM,stepheng8779in what way this charges faster and has better range with pretty much the same passenger and luggage space and heat pump as standard its also going to be more efficient
2023-09-18,-GYjfh1gpkM,because the dash in this is absolutely horrific looks like a 90s dash also the wait times on this are probably going to be far far longer as its brand new some cars are still up to a year wait
2023-09-18,-GYjfh1gpkM,austin2planks interior of kia is way better is in all their cars always has been  is still true today had use of a kona recently whilst my niro was in for an insurance repair they are far from the same cars the kona just felt a poor relation still a good car but attention to detail lacking geared differently too no matter what they say in the garages or press 7 year warranty vs 5 is icing on the cake
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,still cant decide if i like the look of the car could be like the mg4 didnt look great on screen but is very nice in reality
2023-09-18,-GYjfh1gpkM,its definitely got the robocop visor look perhaps the going to be an ad campaign one way or another youre coming with me but how far depends on your driving style ambient temp and whether youre using the hvac
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,why dont you move the steering wheel so you can see the speedo
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,looks like the new e2008 is the winner here
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,said noone but you 
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,that center console and that center dash feels cheap just by looking at it
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,i have a 2020 kona and this looks like a great upgrade  hyundai have been listening to their customers
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,its nearly perfect me thinks waiting to get my order in when released in australia
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,i have the 2021 model and i love it my first electric car  this summer i was averaging 65 miles per klw even in eco mode its fast love it
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,i really dislike this trend that manufacturers are using to describe faux leather  vegan leather eco leather etc  in most cases its plastic so lets call it what it is and not make out that its a green alternative in any form
2023-09-16,-GYjfh1gpkM,i also find it puzzling that vegan leather is described as sustainable isnt leather sustainable and biodegradable
2023-09-16,-GYjfh1gpkM,charlesbridgford254its made of recycled greens the kind of leftovers that used to go on the compost heap
2023-09-18,-GYjfh1gpkM,"charlesbridgford254 leather comes from cattle cattle are not ecofriendly raising cattle pollutes water ways and their methane emissions are contradictory to owning an ev 

faux leather can also be much softer and easier to clean than real leather

i own a car with real leather and i hate the leather seats too firm for driving for hours a day for my job faux leather can be made just as firm or softer than real leather because its a mix of vinyl and other recycled rubber materials its not just a sustainability thing its also a comfort thing

my friend has an ioniq 5 limited and his seats arent real leather either but they feel a helluva lot better than my real leather ones do"
2023-09-18,-GYjfh1gpkM,ncxdesigns cattle are not eco friendly far more eco friendly than plastic
2023-09-21,-GYjfh1gpkM,"but theyre not they use recycled materials so they are eco friendly 

hyundai doesnt list it as vegan or biodegrable just eco friendly the journalist words not theres"
2023-10-03,-GYjfh1gpkM,its cheaper than leather so vegan is how theyre trying to sell the idea to consumers without admitting its purely a cost decision
2023-10-12,-GYjfh1gpkM,drewzerniit also lasts longer and does not need as much maintenance it also feels better in every way its better then leather
2023-11-20,-GYjfh1gpkM,ncxdesignsyou missed the part that leather is biodegradable and natural and a by product of feeding billions of people  until you change billions of humans nutritional habits leather is an absolute superior product hands down
2023-11-24,-GYjfh1gpkM,"yes leather biodegrades in landfill takes about 50 years or so

plastic based leather obviously is 500 years 

funnily enough the co2 footprint is about the same if cattle is being raised as food and the leather is a by product it can be viewed somewhat differently i guess

but cattle are horrendous for the planet they use exponentially more water than humans or crops per acre plus all the co2 and methane they produce

neither are particularly great but had to say real leather if you look after it can last a very very long time most dont realise it needs moisturising and feeding etc to keep to going if you do that it can last so long you wont care

must say having had both you cant beat real leather it just feels nicer as a meat eater i dont think im in a position to lecture one way or the other tbh

until the destruction of vegan leather doesnt release micro plastics they shouldnt be used imho tho"
2023-12-07,-GYjfh1gpkM,pretty sure cows are more eco friendly than humans
2023-12-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,in america we have a faux politician we call it aoc
2024-01-16,-GYjfh1gpkM,we really do live in a dystopian society
2024-04-26,-GYjfh1gpkM,for the small amount of us who are ethical vegetarians and avoid leather for that reason a vegan leather option is very much a plus thats what im looking for and now the market can actually sell it to me
2024-05-06,-GYjfh1gpkM,it means its suitable for vegans vegans would object to actual leather
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,that looks like just another bland suv with no soul
2023-09-15,-GYjfh1gpkM,which suvs do you feel have soul
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,i get some people will hate it im fine with the design myself and it ticks most of the boxes i need a lot of evs are massive this a good size compromise with ok range for me
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,"ok range 
there arent too many evs today with over 300 miles as a range"
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,mikeiow2 well im very likely to buy one so ok decent range especially for the size of the vehicle i stand corrected
2023-10-26,-GYjfh1gpkM,update i did purchase the kona had it 2 weeks now and im very happy with it does what i want it to and not too big
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,multipla successor
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,korean cars are excellent k pop on the other hand is objectively awful unless youre a 12 year old girl
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,wow retro pixel graphics whatever next  even more guff
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,charging port at the front ruins the look
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,a bit marmite on the looks especially side on
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,well balanced review
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,fine bit of woollarding there
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,i think using simple plastic on areas that are not toched often if durable is actually pretty clever it lets u get more features for your money and as u said they did make important parts like the steering wheel and the silver colored buttons feel good so no real complaints
2023-09-18,-GYjfh1gpkM,i 100 agree hard plastic on the top of the door is a no go though as its somewhere many people rest their arms
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,although that charging point at the front looks very handy i am wondering if it could also be an issue a small front end shunt could turn into a very expensive repair and mean the car wont charge until it is fixed
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,i reckon not charging would be the least of worries as theres a trend in the auto insurance companies that heads toward claim adjusters not knowing if the battery pack and or high voltage system is damaged then not willing to accept any risk and writingoff evs with minor damage
2023-09-18,-GYjfh1gpkM,home insurance for the owner and the owers neighbors are about to sky rocket as these cars are a fire hazzard world wide these batteries are exploding causing immense damage i think the ev scam is going to be short lived long live ice
2023-09-24,-GYjfh1gpkM,dont tailgate and pay attention  also they have sensors that mean one gets a warning about being to close
2023-09-26,-GYjfh1gpkM,i have a new mg zs and someone reversed into my car it damaged the charge port and pushed in the flap and i had to get a mechanic to get it out
2023-10-15,-GYjfh1gpkM,100 agree putting charging port in front is a doa on my book
2023-11-18,-GYjfh1gpkM,not to mention that it ruins the look of the front end looks like it was put there as an afterthought
2024-01-24,-GYjfh1gpkM,"medroastt9888 it is the least of your worries the charging point is only a socket easy and low cost to repair the expensive things are things like cameras sensors and radar all that stuff is on the front of any ev inclusing tesla

personally a charging port on the left side of the car like on the tesla is a doa in my book most roadside chargers are on the pavement on the right side of the car unless you park against the flow which is forbidden in most countries this means your charging cableconnector is sticking out on the side where carsbikesetc can easily hit it  accidentally or on purpose"
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,the position of the large  light clusters on corners of the bumpers is going to make parking scrapes expensive someone needs to tell hyundai designers what bumpers are supposed to do namely prevent expensive damage from small impacts
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,its a fair point although i reckon they might be tougher than they look
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,park more carefully please and what about sensors
2023-09-18,-GYjfh1gpkM,sensors are there for a reason if you scrape the bumper even with front sensors you deserve the bill tbh
2023-09-24,-GYjfh1gpkM,stop being negative please
2023-09-24,-GYjfh1gpkM,not to mention how dirty they will get during winter
2024-01-20,-GYjfh1gpkM,you can be the best in the world at parking your car but sometimes other drivers will scrape you getting in and out of parking spaces
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,"k what bt who still never heard of either of them but im very much ok with that   8
as for the car itself it looks _interesting_ to say the least i dont dislike it but im not sure if i do like it"
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,"looks like a 90s hyundai thats not a good thing
and i own an i30 fastback meaning i have sympathy for the brand"
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,looks sharp wish the charging port was centred cant stand the nasty low grade plasticy materials  buttons still much prefer my kia niro ev4 for its plusher interior
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,i like them both the kona has the advantage that the heat pump is standard where as you have to pay extra for it in the niro ev i prefer the smaller 17 inch wheels in the niro ev bigger wheels in the higher spec konas means less comfortable ride and less range the basic spec kona does have the 17 inch wheels i still havent decided which one i prefer
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,looks are subjective i like it
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,yes i think it is ugly as well but at least the charging port is at the front were all evs should be
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,should never on the front
2024-01-13,-GYjfh1gpkM,front best how often are you crashing
2023-09-14,-GYjfh1gpkM,its a shame its so ugly 
2024-06-21,VhHwZub5-bY,love it really nice car smooth drive decent milage my one in white colour
2024-05-26,VhHwZub5-bY,will that rear plug do that toaster i mean hyundai say 15v but dont say how much it can pull
2024-03-08,VhHwZub5-bY,does anyone ordered the new long range kona recently is the  218hp electric motor with 654 kwh battery still available i ordered a new kona in romania and only the 204hp and 648kwh configuration is available
2024-03-02,VhHwZub5-bY,possibly the worst presenter ive ever seen on a channel regardless of one so big
2024-02-24,VhHwZub5-bY,bravo very nice clear presentation i live in turkey your explanation was very useful i have been using renault zoe for 2 years after watching your video i made an appointment for a test drive next week unfortunately the battery of the model arriving in our country is low thank you for your explanations best regards
2024-02-13,VhHwZub5-bY,thank you for addressing the frunk been saying that all a long who in their right mind will open the bonnet on a bidaily basis to access the cable100 not me
2024-04-14,VhHwZub5-bY,you are right no one would keep the cable there if they were using it every 2 days but i have a cable i use rarely if ever and would keep it there rather than have it kicking about in the boot
2024-02-12,VhHwZub5-bY,can hyundai service repair the battery answer is no they can only replace it which could cost the customer big bucks  they shouldve built it on the egmp platform to reduce costs further   but no that wasnt done why develop a new platform and not use it why hyundai loses money on each ev they build
2024-02-10,VhHwZub5-bY,i have a choice between this and the mg zs ev    im torn but this look good
2024-01-21,VhHwZub5-bY,daftjob done
2024-01-16,VhHwZub5-bY,the hate isnt as bad as its made out however over doing it a bit on the prequels
2024-01-15,VhHwZub5-bY,similar kind of presentation as with the ioniq 5 only much later one has to find out that only a slight dent in the under carriage near the batteries would write off the car no mention by alex of the fire danger the enormous repair costs skyrocketing insurance range anxiety high charging costs and extreme depreciation it would be much appreciated if alex could be more honest in her presentations and give us the full picture instead of just the rosy fluff
2024-01-10,VhHwZub5-bY,currently have an ioniq 5 but the  lease up this year so looking at the new kona electric as i dont need ioniq 5 size and i prefer normal buttons ioniq 5 has been a lovely car thou
2024-01-10,VhHwZub5-bY,1 its a froot as in a front boot as we have boots in the uk not trunks and 2 its designed to put the cables in so you dont have to go to the other end of the vehicle and open the boot and then get the cable out from under the false floor of the boot where you just put them
2024-01-09,VhHwZub5-bY,am i the only one seeing a kia sportage
2024-01-08,VhHwZub5-bY,good to see the korean ev manufacturers going for a blend of traditional switchgear climate controls indicator stalks etc and tech large screens mobile phone entry bidirectional charging etc
2024-01-06,VhHwZub5-bY,not putting my kid in an ev fire trap evs are not for families
2024-01-03,VhHwZub5-bY,weak argument about the number of actions needed to access the frunk
2024-01-15,VhHwZub5-bY,hahaha too much realism for ya describing the factual situation is for you a weak argument
2023-12-31,VhHwZub5-bY,when are they just gonna make  a hyundai pixel i mean they have enough of them on these cars
2023-12-28,VhHwZub5-bY,we like kona here in portugal
2023-12-26,VhHwZub5-bY,charging port in the front what a weird choice but for that price its not the end of the world great review overall it looks quite roomy and has a spacious trunk i dig it
2023-12-23,VhHwZub5-bY,it the battery is as poorly protected as the one in the ionic 5 i wont be buying one
2023-12-22,VhHwZub5-bY,i wonder how much hyundai paid her for this all positive no negative where are the cons
2024-01-15,VhHwZub5-bY,alex keeps her contacts happy if she would tell us also the negatives she would be out of a job
2023-12-21,VhHwZub5-bY,that laptop idea is dumb
2023-12-17,VhHwZub5-bY,finally physical buttons much safer while driving coz you dont have to take your eyes off the road while driving
2023-12-16,VhHwZub5-bY,155 i think its probably 15m high and 18m wide unless you are 66 
2023-12-14,VhHwZub5-bY,imagine if they stuck a 77kw battery in this 319 on the 66kw is insane youd be looking at around 370 miles
2023-12-13,VhHwZub5-bY,i would define this car ugly  what a shame
2023-12-13,VhHwZub5-bY,it looks much better than its predecessor
2023-12-11,VhHwZub5-bY,my 2023 kia soul ev here in canada has the charge port in the same location as this car and i can tell you it freezes shut in our cold winter despite having the same flap apparatus shown here so no it will still freeze and you should carry some deicing spray just in case
2023-12-20,VhHwZub5-bY,its heated
2023-12-20,VhHwZub5-bY,michaeldecsi1698 might be but its weak as hell couldnt get mine opened after we had freezing rain over night two weeks ago and i had to use deicer to get it to finally open
2023-12-11,VhHwZub5-bY,reminds me of robocops helmet
2023-12-11,VhHwZub5-bY,we want our man there the description tone is going too soft sounds less of review  more of flattery
2023-12-10,VhHwZub5-bY,shame its so ugly 
2023-12-06,VhHwZub5-bY,interesting video which brings the kona back onto the radar  ammusing that every shot of the car had it bouncing around like a kid on a pogo stick though 
2023-12-06,VhHwZub5-bY,250 the frunk is not useless at all imagine that you are on vacation with the trunk full of luggage and the charging cable is under the false floor in the trunk what are you doing  put down the luggage to get the cable isnt it better to have the cable in front in frunk
2023-12-06,VhHwZub5-bY,i buying this auto i hope so soon i dont know just thesewhen is fully charged how many km can drive
2023-12-05,VhHwZub5-bY,i was in the market for an ev and this ticked all practical boxes but the looks no
2023-12-02,VhHwZub5-bY,car would look so much better without these bottom lights from a different car or a bus d
2023-12-02,VhHwZub5-bY,has some features that i wish my ioniq 5 had  rear wiper blade plenty of physical buttons a better screen layout with a more analog feel slightly smaller will be a plus on uk roads pity they decided to go 400v rather than 800v though
2023-12-02,VhHwZub5-bY,"they should have put the charging port in the centre at the front and then had the hyundai badge on it
its great that they have physical buttons for heating etc though that isnt always a given anymore unfortunately"
2023-11-29,VhHwZub5-bY,aud price

2023-11-28,VhHwZub5-bY,hello nice little carbut a very ugly set of headlights the previous generation looked much more appealing
2023-11-28,VhHwZub5-bY,lets start with the look love it
2023-11-26,VhHwZub5-bY,point of information  4 dots in morse code represents the letter h hyundai
2023-11-25,VhHwZub5-bY,with alex and rory on great form theres no need to regret the pausing of tg informative and entertaining content of real cars with the occasional lunatic trackmuncher thrown in
2023-12-03,VhHwZub5-bY,yeah this very much had a tg review feel to it not bad or derivative but the general flow felt very similar perhaps not quite as many overt silly references or elaborate cinematography but it definitely feels like it has the same presenter dna as it were
2023-11-24,VhHwZub5-bY,this is a bold af design
2023-11-23,VhHwZub5-bY,mmm pressable buttons i do really love those
2023-11-23,VhHwZub5-bY,awful looking car
2023-11-22,VhHwZub5-bY,allready got one gorgeaous
2023-11-22,VhHwZub5-bY,why make it look so bloody awful
2023-11-21,VhHwZub5-bY,my question would be does the kona build still feel cheaper than the niro ev thats its competition id say at least in the usa where our cheaper ev offerings are nonexistent
2023-12-01,VhHwZub5-bY,the niro is a bigger bigger car
2023-12-03,VhHwZub5-bY,bernardhilton3527 thats what i was wondering back in the day the niro had a bigger boot space and now that the kona has gotten an upgrade on that front are they about on par
2023-11-21,VhHwZub5-bY,yikes that cars surfaces were overdrawn by 2x wth hyundai do you pay your designers by the line
2023-11-20,VhHwZub5-bY,alex is a great rewiver
2023-11-20,VhHwZub5-bY,costs too much why would anyone buy this over a model 3 for the same money
2023-11-19,VhHwZub5-bY,there goes the fog light when adding a tow bar
2023-11-19,VhHwZub5-bY,that front charging port is hideous if you have a front charge point locate centrally and it the kona or hyundai insignia
2023-11-19,VhHwZub5-bY,is it me or is the car bouncing around that long curve
2023-11-19,VhHwZub5-bY,"alexandra is sublime

2023-11-18,VhHwZub5-bY,great review alex  as ussual  im not jet convinced about full electric cars but im getting there  some look very nice so i might drive some full electric car one day
2023-11-18,VhHwZub5-bY,is it just me or does the interior look outdated already
2023-11-18,VhHwZub5-bY,where do you store your charging cables type 2 then if not in the frunk  you really want to take all your luggage out so you can get your charging cables out no thanks ill put mine in the frunk and 27l is a good size for a type2 cable
2023-11-18,VhHwZub5-bY,do you mean 18m wide 15m high 
2023-11-18,VhHwZub5-bY,frunks can be used to keep a freaking spare tire but no they prefer to include a useless tire inflation kit cause is cheaper 
2023-12-13,VhHwZub5-bY,i saw the demo model in australia and it actually had a space saver tyre havent seen the production model as yet as we have had none delivered over here
2023-11-17,VhHwZub5-bY,too many creases and charger at the front spoils it for me
2023-11-17,VhHwZub5-bY,add chapters
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,"in the footage through the trees where the road surface was a mini rollercoaster the car looked to be way under damped
if you regularly carry kids in the back and you let them use their devices it could be a good idea to invest in some of those paper bags the airlines provide     "
2023-11-17,VhHwZub5-bY,it will be a pig in a wallow
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,i cannot get my head around the chargingport door  the kia niro ev sibling car has a rectangular ish door front deadcentre for some quirk of the human brain this does not seem to be nearly as noticeable or in your face
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,"dont knock the frunk  the charge port is in the front so it is the perfect size and location to store the charging cables  so many reviews tell us that the space below the luggage compartment floor is where you put your cables the only time you are guaranteed to need them is on a trip when the luggage compartment is full of  wait for it  luggage
do i really want to empty all my matching louis vuitton calfskin portmanteaus onto the wet greasy tarmac in a downpour just to get to my cables     nnooo       "
2023-12-23,VhHwZub5-bY,having owned an eniro since march 2019 i can tell you that when youre on a long trip and are loaded up with luggage you dont need your charge cable this is because you are only interested in dc rapid chargers en route and of course they have their own cables we live in south west france and have done many long haul trips within france to uk switzerland and germany and the only reason to access the type 2 cable is when staying in hotels that offer free overnight charging by which time you have unloaded your cases and freed up the underfloor storage for the cablesjust thought i would throw in some real world experience there 
2023-12-23,VhHwZub5-bY,"kiaenirodiariesencore4270   interesting how we each do our own individual thing  i have a one year old niro ev  i live in the centre of the north island of new zealand and am unlikely to drive for more than five hours in a day  you run into the ocean after that  this greatly reduces the need to use public chargers
our most recent real world experience from a very different part of the world went like this
hastings  wellington  stayed with our son charged overnight from his 10amp power point using our cable
caught cook strait ferry and drove picton  christchurch  stayed one week with motherinlaw  charged from her 10amp power point using our cable
drove christchurch  picton  stayed at jasmine court motel and charged with their complimentary 7kw charger using our cable  great service try to find accommodation that will give you a complimentary gastank top up  some new zealand retail shops are also offering free 7kw charging with your own cables
caught cook strait ferry and drove wellington  hastings  stopped for a meal and decided to add a bit of charge from a chargenet charger the only time we did not use our own cables
while we were travelling the back of the car was full to the brim  luggage computer printer bedding box of plant cuttings and an ebike
every time i charged with one of our own cables i said a quiet thankyou to the frunk  i cant think of anything else i would use it for  the charge port is right there
final bit of info for those pondering an ev  before this trip we have done 5500km 3400 miles in 5 months  our power plan supplies free electricity to our home daily from 9pm to midnight so we have spent a total of nzd1274 usd800 on fuel   whats not to like"
2023-12-28,VhHwZub5-bY,ours experience on the same type of trips with our niro ev which is very similar to the new kona with a boot full of mountain bike gear which we dont empty into the hotel room having the cable in the frunk right next to the charging port is really useful and it saves seconds not having to walk from one of the car and back again 
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,it seems to be based on hyundai creta car
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,omg a company that listens to its customers  actual buttons wow
2023-11-19,VhHwZub5-bY,they made a comeback
2023-11-19,VhHwZub5-bY,pity they didnt listen to the uk customers when it comes to the i30n fastback or kona n 
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,great review alex  very honest and actually a very nice car for families
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,the daft punk references are fantastic the game has changed made me smile especially love the tron soundtrack
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,"really like this actually evs make for really good family cars besides the potential charging worries theyre so nice and quiet and a car that isnt trying to be both comfortable and sporty all in one just makes sense 

just keep all the fun cars ice then everybody is happy "
2023-11-19,VhHwZub5-bY,dead right we have four ice performance cars in the garage and just ordered a kona ev for the family runabout on the company car scheme the bik is negligibleso its essentially a free car
2023-12-24,VhHwZub5-bY,test drove the mg4 xpower recently that thing smashes most smaller ice performance cars even some super cars cant keep up with its sub 4 second 0 to 60 time plus it has two motors that power all 4 wheels give me that absolute beast over any ice car for fun and raw acceleration almost 430 horse power too you wont find that kind of power in a brand new petrol car for 36000
2023-12-24,VhHwZub5-bY,"nomanspiethe mg4 xpower is on our company car list and i have one as a loaner at the moment once you get over the quick acceleration its not a very well rounded car handling is not great and apart from the fun of a rapid 060mph sprint the thrill of which wears off after a few runs its not a fun car to drive also the interior isnt great the screen is laggy the range isnt up to much in the cold it has loads of overly intrusive driver aids which you cannot permanently disable its definitely not something id want longterm 

there are a few evs that can match petrol for fun eg my friends taycan is a match for my 911 turbo but most evs have rapid acceleration but none of the poise weve come to expect from well engineered ice cars this will change in time but for now most evs are good for the family runabout but not proper performance motoring as weve come to love

060 figures do not make a fun car in fact my most fun car is my slowest at a humble 060mph in 6s"
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,shes by far the best road tester around
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,is it kona or konar
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,to me hyundai entire design philosophy is  take every other car design going  and then blend each element into our design  im sorry thats fugly  if a car could be designed for radio then thats it
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,thumbs up alexyy
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,not my type of car but very much enjoyed the review much more relaxed and natural i cant believe i actually watched a full review video of kona ev though did make me wince when that awful frunk word was mentioned beetles 911s and all manner of other midengined cars have managed to survive for decades with having a boot in the front  why do we have to give it a new name just because musk decides to give it one in his teslas 
2023-12-23,VhHwZub5-bY,oohhh dear i just used the hated word in my comment above ill give myself forty lashes    
2024-01-19,VhHwZub5-bY,i agree  at least call it a froot if you want to rename it
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,expensive go for a tesla model 3 long range by adding a little more and get a better car
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,this car is way too ugly for my taste
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,the frunk is totally practical for storing things you dont access often like tools and emergency gear
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,"nice review 
not a fan of the vehicle"
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,id buy one i just need a job and a home first 
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,this monstrosity will be one of the ugliest vehicles on the road
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,nice hyundai kona ev
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,loved all the references to daft punk
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,that charging port is hideous 
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,from the side it looks like a car sitting on top of a car 
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,you know when a sculpture chisels out a design from a tree trunk or a slate of rock its like someone wanted to make a car but stopped halfway through
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,more bounce than pamela anderson 
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,love your personality alex
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,that lass is massively tall if the height of the car is 18m and width is 15m
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,its ugly
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,alex will always be one of my favourite car reviewer
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,appreciate the daft punk song referencesnice touch 
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,your performance is always excellent and your voice is very pleasant thank you
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,very good love the daft punk stuff
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,saw one yesterday those lights on front and back corners makes it look weird ssangyong vibes
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,take away the front the sides and the back it looks really nice whos idea was it to drop the lights down there  and the camera jumping up and down makes it look like youre sitting in a bouncy castle
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,frunks are useful for one thing  somewhere to put charging cables that wont be covered up when you load the car with luggage
2023-11-21,VhHwZub5-bY,its literally the most sensible use for them
2023-11-27,VhHwZub5-bY,agreed also a good spot for emergencyfirst aid kits and fire extinguisher to keep them handy and accessible
2024-01-27,VhHwZub5-bY,i installed one in my 2019 version  the most useful thing  especially to carry items that have strong smells like fresh sea food wet clothes shoes etc that you dont want in the cabin  ofcourse the extension cables and charger cables
2024-01-31,VhHwZub5-bY,i put ice in my frunk and put some coors light in there so i can drive and drink when i reach my destination
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,no thanks not touching evs
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,mine is due january 24 i didnt even see it in the flesh but its fully loaded for a company car
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,damn that is an ugly car how is it possible to come up with something so wrong after the rather aesthetically pleasing ioniq 5 and 6 
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,enter budget for replacement headlights as perfectly positioned for corner scrapes
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,you should probably learn to drive never hit the corner of any of my cars in 25 years
2023-11-19,VhHwZub5-bY,maybe dont hit things
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,heeundie
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,"why on earth did they put the charging port in that front offset position
why not place it in the centre and make the opening symmetrical in shape and not odd shaped and if they were to leave it where it is then design something to match for the other side of the car to give it some balance
as it stands it looks horrid and whoever passed it off as a great front end design obviously didnt have their contact lenses in that day   8"
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,came here to say the same absolutely gopping
2023-12-01,VhHwZub5-bY,just buy a black car you wont see it then
2023-12-06,VhHwZub5-bY,its convenient especially in north american charging spaces
2023-12-07,VhHwZub5-bY,"chemicalhap convenient agreed
but at least they could do something to make it look symmetrical   8"
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,looks like theres a couple of contrasting design languages going on here  the big triangle crease looks great on the ionic5 but looks crowbarred in on this more rounded aesthetic
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,spot on this one looks closer to crumpled paper whilst the ionic 5 looks like origami
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,sports2hedz542 yeah i love how consistent the ionic5 is uncompromising like one persons vision
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,hyundai really had a glow up
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,"alexandra is great for previewes of new cars but also for daily driver affordable car reviews like this and rory for all the high end cars 

i like how affordable this car is as your drive to the city or grocery boring cheap car"
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,18 metres high 150 gosh this woman is about 6ft 6 then 
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,poor charging speed small battery slow and meh looks not for me
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,slowreally
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,i think kensladen meant slow charging speed to which i agree 102kw max charging speed for a 65kwh battery is really slow nowadays
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,hyundai made a huge marketing research name mistake since kona means de c word in portuguese and it is electric  i dont think hyundai kona electrics will sell any cars in portuguese spoken countries
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,they sell as hyundai kauai over here
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,impressive for a midrage  car branda good wife car
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,alex great review as always even your review balanced  and correct however hyundai are trying to out pig ugly tesla as to how stupid and cartoon like a car can actually look god awful lets be honest  dreadful i cannot imagine what the n version will look like heres a thing the brake lights on hyundai cars surely illegal so low down as to be barely visible follow one down  mucky country lane on a autumn day and its guess if the snug hyundai driver is going to brake dreadful as i have said before just make it stop
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,the buyer of these will not afford them and only rent them
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,lovely review but my god electric cars are ugly
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,i think everyone should consider any electric cars daft given their horrendous residuals
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY, more electric crap
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,one thing youre wrong about  side profile  tucson influences not ionic 5
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,yup its a tucson with different light design basically and with battery of course
2023-11-27,VhHwZub5-bY,shes not wrong the diagonal slash is reminiscent of ioniq 5
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,great review alex
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,i really struggle with the starting price of 35000 for that money you can get a top specification full leather citroën ec4  or ec4 x with same range and power i also can not get past the rear lights on the wheel arches like they forgot them and put them on afterwards the front just looks like any chinese car
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,same price as a volvo xe30 
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,rajuk4625 indeed you are correct  the volvo slipped my mind i havent seen the volvo ex30 in the flesh yet my guess is it is smaller vauxhall mokka  fiat 600 sized
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,mikadavies660  it does 060 in sub 4 secs too 
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,rajuk4625  you mean the volvo ex30 does yes but i would be interested to try the ex30 and the smart 1 brabus the testers have all prefered the smart brabus for handling we shall see as i have just yesterday booked a test drive for the smart
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,rajuk4625not at 35000 it doesnt
2024-04-16,VhHwZub5-bY,rajuk4625 i think the ex30 is a bit smaller than the kona
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,yet another ugly car of 2023 or should i say ev
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,what makes it ugly and why does it matter if its an ev
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,janhenkins first of all its yet another crossover which is the equivalent of a normal sized person who got really fat and started wearing high heals at the same time the square like front and back wing looks like something a diy person did themselves and stock on to the chassis in their home garage the pentagonal back lights are stock on to the back wings and does not fit the design of the light strip i could go on and on this is a design a 10 year old or a chinese person would really like to point out its an ev matters to some especially since they are being forced on to consumers as being more environment friendly by pointing the finger at the consumer it gives the politicians a free pass from doing something about the things that really matter to the environment
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,"jwester7009 fair enough on the looks of the car i can see why it doesnt appeal i like your anology about a portly person in high heels  with regards it being an ev i still dont see why that should be a negative i dont agree that they are being forced onto consumers and they are truly more environmentaly friendly i decided without being forced by anybody to buy a secondhand nissan leaf as an experiment it has obvious flaws ugly small battery etc but as a car it is the best vehicle i have ever owned it drives better costs less i pay less than 10 per month charging it where my previous car cost me approx 115 per month on diesel and does not blow co1 nox and particulants into the atmosphere my energy provider octopus energy gets 100 of their energy from renewable sources so it is good to know that my car is as green as i can make it but apart from it being green having this ev is a far more practical thing it performs extremely well even with modest power i can outaccellerate most gaspowered cars up to 30mph and costs almost nothing to run and maintain why would i go back to a gas car it simply does not make any financial sense

i also dont see why politics should be mentioned in a youtube videos comment section but since it was brought up we are at the start of a climate emergency largely caused by us this is not a fib lie fabrication or old wives tale the impersonal science shows it clearly to all who wish to see electric cars are only a small part of the solution although it is a very good start we have an enourmous amount of work to do in order to try and fight this monster we have created the only politics at play here would be the petroleum companies and their lobbyists buying off politicians to keep us in our place  a captive audience burning the stuff they sell us at a price that they control take note of any politician or journalist telling you that evs are bad and are being forced on people find out who they are and look into their background more often than not with a little bit of googling you might just find that they have ties to those monstrously rich petroleum companies that makes megatons of cash while people like us have problems affording the basics in life

so back to the car  yes its supremely ugly  although i think my old leaf could just be uglier than that and yet i find myself not caring at all and its an ev one tick in its favour but dang im now going to see that car on stilletos in my minds eye and i just cannot unsee it not hyundais finest work to be sure"
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,alex has really gotten into the flow of her presentation style since she first appeared with cory all that time ago what a lovely addition to the channel
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,rory  
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,agree well done alex
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,thanks buddy 
2023-11-17,VhHwZub5-bY,mrsandchess ill commit sudoku for my transgression to honor my family 
2023-11-17,VhHwZub5-bY,legouix bruh i just come to watch the channel youre doing the heavy lifting but youre welcome
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,"a vehicle is more likely to have a front or rear collision than a side impact so putting the charging socketflap on the front bumper is a big no
mg made the same mistake"
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,"front impact none drivable
side impact none drivable 
makes absolutely no difference"
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,phuketexplorer so a dented door means none drivable no it doesnt but a dented bumper including the charge port area does when your unable to charge the car
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,phuketexplorer think at the percentage of front crashes well rearend crashes from the other perspective vs side crashes and reformulate
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,wolvoman1if a front impact means no front charging then why do you think a side impact of comparable impact wouldnt mean no side charging
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,wolvoman1and your logic doesnt apply to ice vehicles with radiators at the front theyre the first thing to be broken in a front end shunt but it hasnt stopped manufacturers putting them there for the past 120 years 
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,phuketexplorer your replies are completely ott i am talking about minor collisions that could damage the charging socket not complete write offs or heavy damage
2023-11-16,VhHwZub5-bY,wolvoman1if it were just a minor shunt the charging port door would still be able to be prised open or removed completely in the highly unlikely event of having the accident when the battery was completely dead the engineers that design these parts arent stupid
2023-11-25,VhHwZub5-bY,ive seen 3 people have their cables smashed out at chargers with side  mounted charge flaps  the front is the right place
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,the asymetric chargeport at the front why just why1
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,its always been like that on the kona and it makes charging a breeze thats why
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,userdb5vw9we2m  so asymmetricity makes charging a breeze huh you learn something everyday
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,afternoon alex
2023-11-15,VhHwZub5-bY,im probably the only one but i think it looks amazing just wish they hadnt killed the n

2024-03-22,0rrUKDCWnBU,who taught it was a good idea to put the head and rear lights in there the place where most vehicles get scratches of course they are gonna be selling replacements parts like bread
2024-03-17,0rrUKDCWnBU,bit of a useless review too much time wasted talking about alternatives and really poorly presented nothing about the continuously annoying driver warning bongs and warnings probably the worst review of this car skimpy and pathetic
2024-03-11,0rrUKDCWnBU,under 30 on the used market already
2024-03-10,0rrUKDCWnBU,i love our new kona electric sel bought it here in kona hawaii usa list price us40k but was on sale for us33k which is an excellent deal i dont know why people are complaining about the daw my kona doesnt beep at me if i exceed the speed limit there is a small red notice on the display but nothing audible or distracting
2024-05-22,0rrUKDCWnBU,it seems that models in canada and usa do not have this feature  the hardware is mounted on the steering wheel and is absent in konas for sale in canusa   in the uk and australia it appears to be legally  required
2024-03-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,does anyone ordered the new long range kona recently is the  218hp electric motor with 654 kwh battery still available i ordered a new kona in romania and only the 204hp and 648kwh configuration is available
2024-04-09,0rrUKDCWnBU,thats the old model
2024-04-09,0rrUKDCWnBU,jonathonblacker299 no its the new one it was downgraded to the exact specs like the new kia niro ev
2024-03-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,but whatever your income allows  life is too short 
2024-03-03,0rrUKDCWnBU,"here i am in nyc working in a hotel immigrated in 1993 obsessed with electric cars suddenly you post a video of my home
i lived on the edge of the park until i was 19 kinda brought a tear to my eye"
2024-04-18,0rrUKDCWnBU,crystal palace 
2024-03-01,0rrUKDCWnBU,good lord thats fugly looks like an already crashed ssanyong rhodius
2024-02-29,0rrUKDCWnBU,speak slower if you want a foreign audience  in fact just speak slower
2024-02-29,0rrUKDCWnBU,he talks normally lol just put it in 075 speed
2024-02-21,0rrUKDCWnBU,nice car only thing i dont like is that you have to disable the warning noises every time you get in the car the speed warning start to beep when you drive 1 kmt over the speed limit witch is just silly even the cruise control cant manage to be that precise 45 kmt over would be fine when your speedometer shows 70 kmt you are more likely driving at 65 cause there is 45 kmt error added to the speedometer on all cars
2024-03-10,0rrUKDCWnBU,"everytime you get in the car really thats a bummer 

my wife will get one in a couple of weeks and i am gathering info about it now thanks for this 

i hope they can make an update that lets the driver choose to disable it premanently 
all those silly features makes me sick its like we are all dumb
especially when someone have driven cars since mid 1990s when all those features did not exist and we are used to think with our own brain when driving no need to have all those alarms its just too much"
2024-07-14,0rrUKDCWnBU,they actually dont bother me much by the way when we were buying kona i had some worries about this beebs
2024-02-19,0rrUKDCWnBU,the daw driver attention warning system is horrible irritating and actively distracting often when you can least afford to be distracted and it cannot be turned off yes i have gone to the dealer and they confirmed that it cannot be turned off and that it is working as designed on winding roads or in fog or a snowstorm it will beep loudly at you every 4 minutes other than this antifeature it is a fantastic vehicle
2024-02-23,0rrUKDCWnBU,pull the fuse 
2024-03-09,0rrUKDCWnBU,it can be turned off but you need to do it every time the car is restarted
2024-03-10,0rrUKDCWnBU,essahlinwhich one which one 
2024-03-10,0rrUKDCWnBU,for the record i did it this morning again
2024-02-17,0rrUKDCWnBU,evs just arent selling so this is gonna struggle the garages are full of them they just cant sell i stick with diesel or maybe a plugin and this is way too expensive
2024-02-15,0rrUKDCWnBU,how can a car be car of the year even though an excellent vehicle when its ncap score is only 4 stars  auto express need to refine pluses and minuses when coming to cars of the year to look less silly
2024-04-09,0rrUKDCWnBU,you do know part of the ncap test includes how pedestrians fair in collisions as all compact and full fat suvs they loss points due to the higher impact points when hitting someone
2024-02-14,0rrUKDCWnBU,like your style  excellent presentation
2024-02-13,0rrUKDCWnBU,you would be mad to chose this over the smart 1 or ex30 looks ugly slow and overpriced
2024-02-20,0rrUKDCWnBU,the ex30 is more expensive so not sure of your reasoning there well i say that its more expensive on my companys lease car scheme
2024-03-28,0rrUKDCWnBU,ex30 actual range is horrible
2024-03-28,0rrUKDCWnBU,richardjones73 actually if you do some research it is actually cheaper depending on the spec 
2024-02-11,0rrUKDCWnBU,"i dont understand how your car of the year is beyond most people in costs and a car that nobody will want in 3 years time 
evs are losing value very quickly and insurance is becoming a joke 
so how can you recommend this"
2024-03-04,0rrUKDCWnBU,ev model and the mid trip is for schmucks essential model its where its at paid it in full first car i ever bought new and i absolutely love it but i always hated ev cause i hate china and am not a sucker nor useful idiot for their rare earth minerals leftists will sell their children future for virtue signaling so fuckem
2024-02-11,0rrUKDCWnBU,funny how tesla is the number 1 selling car but auto express never gives them an award pure corruption
2024-02-14,0rrUKDCWnBU,funny you dictate the best being the item that sells the most
2024-03-14,0rrUKDCWnBU,lots of folks just avoid elon musk
2024-02-11,0rrUKDCWnBU,you voted a milk float car of the year  you obviously are in the wrong business
2024-02-10,0rrUKDCWnBU,can you talk a bit faster
2024-02-10,0rrUKDCWnBU,nice car prices need to come down significantly though
2024-02-21,0rrUKDCWnBU,get a job the price on the car is pretty good it is not a lada

2024-02-10,0rrUKDCWnBU,pure glamour
2024-02-09,0rrUKDCWnBU,i could never afford one of these i go to work but my neighbour has one hes on disability but he cant speak english so i cant ask him about it thats why im here
2024-02-09,0rrUKDCWnBU,this chap sounds like his talking through his nose
2024-02-09,0rrUKDCWnBU,4 encapnot qualifyed as familly carbye bye kona
2024-02-09,0rrUKDCWnBU,presenter needs to slow down talking much too quickly to be able to take in what appears to be a good car
2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,headlamps placed at the extreme outer side of the front and back bumper looks very futuristic that is until you bump those pesky concrete walls 
2024-02-25,0rrUKDCWnBU,perhaps people should take more care driving and not blame the manufacturer when they crash 
2024-02-29,0rrUKDCWnBU,evindecisionwell said
2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,looks like someone tumble dried their trousers by mistake
2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,just dont scrape the bottom of the car or youll be in for an expensive fix
2024-02-18,0rrUKDCWnBU,maybe ignorant question but can i ask why
2024-02-20,0rrUKDCWnBU,pipahlalah8711 there are other videos on yt that particularly in canada if you damage the battery protection tray underneath the car even just a scratch hyundai invalidate the warranty and write the whole car off
2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,heres the thing its a nice car too look at but your final statement of its 40000 but thats just what evs are these days still doesnt make it right or justifiable plus itll cost a fortune to insure so how can an expensive ev be anywhere close to being recommendable as a car of year
2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,indeed and paying for it on monthlys makes no difference  its still 40k
2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,pallettowngangster9297 exactly
2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,so now i have to look at the bumper to see if they are indicating seems a backward step for safety
2024-02-10,0rrUKDCWnBU,really thats a poor excuse all cars have different indicators why moan about these ones 
2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,why do they have to put the charge port at the front of the car 
2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,so you can charge it
2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,i wouldnt buy one with the port on the front i charge at home so need the rear charging port like my present hyundai 
2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,patrickh7368 id argue that front port charging is better i have to park against a wall and my charger is on that wall if the port is on the back left side i cant reach the port with my cable without pulling it right around the car each time to charge if the port is on the right i cant get out my car unless i park it the other way round which will mean the cable is in the road front charging is perfect for me
2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,mrneeds each to their own of course but for me charge cable would need to be twice as long and stick out in the direction of the public walkway  that rear passenger side suits me as i can still access the boot whilst charging  6 of 1 and half a dozen of the other i guess 
2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,patrickh7368 indeed i like the flexibility of most cars nowadays theres an option for everyone
2024-02-10,0rrUKDCWnBU,much better at the front
2024-02-10,0rrUKDCWnBU,alantov lol  as mentioned its to suit but i wouldnt buy an ev with front charging port but not an issue at the mo with inflated prices on evs  mine never falters and 5 years old now at the time just same price as an ice car
2024-04-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,patrickh7368 ive had a kia eniro since 2019 charge port is where it should be at the front for me to charge at home
2024-04-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,kiaenirodiariesencore4270 lol and my hyundai is where it should be at the rear for me to charge at home   as mentioned its each to their ownnot for me on the front 
2024-05-28,0rrUKDCWnBU,why not
2024-02-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,good car but way too expensive i mean idk about gb prices but in eu  kona electric and model y are similarly priced  ofc kona got cooled seats head up and electric sunroof but space charging speed and range are on a different level
2024-02-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,hate evs any ev lover replying to my comment can foff 
2024-02-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,common sense has forwards for drive and backwards for reverse i have ruled out the manufacturers that ludicrously have forwards for backwards and back is forwards  crazy idea
2024-03-15,0rrUKDCWnBU,i know its annoying and counterintuitive i understand why several manufacturers early on did it to keep it the same as ice automatics but by this time especially as its all electronically done and gear changing controls can be placed anywhere forwards for forwards back for back is obviously the sensible way its especially annoying if youve never driven an automatic before you switch to an ev as it makes absolutely no sense to have the directions reversed
2024-03-15,0rrUKDCWnBU,markparker5585 my thoughts especially after boat driving always the correct way round driving boats
2024-02-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,new staff is terrible unsub

2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,did you hear about the bull being spread around the internet via bot based comments just like this one do a search on yt
2024-02-10,0rrUKDCWnBU,bs
2024-02-10,0rrUKDCWnBU,"alantov

2024-02-21,0rrUKDCWnBU,it has 8 years battery warranty you nitwit
2024-02-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,love your videos you are my comfort youtuber 
2024-02-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,"way too expensive for what it is 

pay 35k for that car today it will be worth 15k this time next year"
2024-02-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,buy a 12month old one
2024-02-09,0rrUKDCWnBU,that makes no sense given the previous model is worth more than that at a year old
2024-02-10,0rrUKDCWnBU,bs
2024-02-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,bots are strong today
2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,im surprised comments sections even exist nowadays with the amount of negativity being spread in them youd think all comments sections would be disabled with the amount of bad takes peoplebots have
2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,mrneedsto be fair the bots are normally really positive
2024-02-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,i realise you have to say you like these evs  after all its your job but would you really buy one yourself using your hardearner salary 
2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,yes  many people do buy evs with their hard earned salary
2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,homertrix thats good to hear
2024-02-08,0rrUKDCWnBU,yes and live to regret  it  and lose a fortune  trading  in to get a car that works in the real world
2024-02-10,0rrUKDCWnBU,michaelkilbride2927strange ive been using evs for 3 years in the real world and theyre fantastic
2024-03-01,0rrUKDCWnBU,michaelkilbride2927 do you read the daily mail by any chance
2024-02-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,where to charge
2024-02-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,anywhere that has electricity
2024-04-22,0rrUKDCWnBU,most people charge at home
2024-02-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,this makes fiat multipla looks like lambo
2024-02-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,a electric shirbox car of the year   when it runs out of charge in summer  because you used the air con you can nip down the the road for a bucket  of sparks to top it up
2024-02-10,0rrUKDCWnBU,aircon uses very little juice it would run of charge after about 300 miles in the summer with aircon on
2024-02-18,0rrUKDCWnBU,i recently had to drive a courtesy petrol car its like going back in time they stink they rattle they drive terribly unless youre in a high end sports model pretty much any ev is a massive step up from a standard petrol or diesel car
2024-02-18,0rrUKDCWnBU,cubeforc3 there is a mechanic  on every corner that can fix a  ice car  a parts store nearby  good luck getting that kind of back up with your ev government  pushing ev cars when has government  done anything good for you wa
2024-02-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,you are so out of touch
2024-02-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,far too expensive
2024-02-07,0rrUKDCWnBU,used prices of evs have fallen extremely fast recently definitely better value than new list prices
2024-04-24,0rrUKDCWnBU,how is this expensive its 30k
2024-07-17,0rrUKDCWnBU,what do you compare with
2024-07-05,SNFCtFiLhYQ,the petrol is not more agressive its the n line styling that is more agressive available on all types please do your homework properly
2024-07-05,SNFCtFiLhYQ,havenrail it seems we are having a battle of opinions which are very subjective when it comes to styling however the electric and combustion models have styling differences the nline electric has a much simpler grille design featuring the brands more futuristic pixel elements whereas the combustion model features a sportier honeycomb grille and more dynamic styling could i possibly suggest you please do your homework properly before commenting thank you 
2024-07-06,SNFCtFiLhYQ,autosocialuk i just bought one and spent weeks looking at the different models before deciding so i have done my homework
2024-04-11,SNFCtFiLhYQ,mine is arriving soo looked at loads niro too and kona was one for me
2024-03-15,SNFCtFiLhYQ,my daughter is thinking about purchasing one of these so your review was very timely the other vehicle she is considering is the kia nero any thoughts as to which would make the better purchase i see the koan has a heat pump as standard whereas this is a cost option on the niro im not familiar enough with evs to know how much of a benefit the heat pump is
2024-03-16,SNFCtFiLhYQ,the kona is a much better car from the specs as you mention heat pump as standard for heating cabin in very cold weathernot essential in our climate but will pay for itself if you keep the car for 5 years id say better range nicer interior however the niro is bigger and has a longer warranty it kind of depends on her priorities such as whether size price how shell fund itwhat deals are available for each availability and possibly other stuff is important lots of things to consider in this sort of major purchasing decision which is difficult to answer in a short reply also i would suggest you get her to look at the following video from another uk ev channel which is a very interesting take on the uk ev market presently httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuzj88bs1dje
2024-02-27,SNFCtFiLhYQ,is this kona ev advance
2024-01-29,SNFCtFiLhYQ,great review tish
2024-01-27,SNFCtFiLhYQ,the outgoing variant looks way better than the new one as shown in this video   
2024-01-19,SNFCtFiLhYQ,hello dear lady you look great today with such cool bright red lipstick you seem to have perfect lips you are such a cool and hot lady driver i like you in general i want you
2024-01-16,SNFCtFiLhYQ,maybe more of a personal preference but im not sure how anyone can prefer the kia niro interior design to the 24 kona the screens are much better with no random curve and thinner bezels theres no ugly logo on the steering wheel theres a good array of buttons theres no fingerprint hogging gloss black there is nothing i can think of that the niro does better when it comes to that interior cockpit area of the car
2024-01-16,SNFCtFiLhYQ,i think retroic appearance at front console is gorgeous i love it by the way will you review togg t10x 
2024-01-16,SNFCtFiLhYQ,this is so awkward to be so elegant while reviewing a dirty car i am sorry but as a parisian you must be classy and glam and your car should meet your style
2024-01-16,SNFCtFiLhYQ,have you ever driven with grit on the roads  i got dirty just driving to the location
2024-01-15,SNFCtFiLhYQ,sorry what a load of rubbish im 6 foot seat right back no space behind and why would you need to do your hair in a electric car wasting power lol 
2024-01-15,SNFCtFiLhYQ,value for money car 
2024-01-15,SNFCtFiLhYQ,what are you conflicted about with regards to the interior i love the fact it has buttons as i really dislike everything being controlled through the screens andor haptic buttons which dont give that sense of confirmation as with traditional buttons i really like the interior
2024-01-15,SNFCtFiLhYQ,i think the centre console is ugly it looks like a radio from the 90s i prefer the angular kia but its all personal preference
2024-05-16,SNFCtFiLhYQ,autosocialuk i dont want to agree but i do  but then again the exterior seems to be a nod to the original robocop and that was 1987  so they went with a 1987 interior
2024-01-15,SNFCtFiLhYQ,kona will always be second best having being built from a combustion platform i do like what theyve done but a ground up ev wont be that much more especially used
2024-01-15,SNFCtFiLhYQ,this generation was built as an ev first and then a combustion second this time around 
2024-01-15,SNFCtFiLhYQ,good review tish but sorry the only good thing is they have kept the buttons on the facia outside the car is awful looking and that back end is horrid looking sorry but i am not a fan of any of this brands models now and its all to do with the styling
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,its an alright car cheers love
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,"is the new kia niro ev as good as the old e niro   4k

petrol ped"
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,buttons 
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,evening tish
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,wow what a good suv
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,1257 its an excellent job by hyundai interior and all the front exterior design is much to plain and could have been better and whats up with those hidious rims something more attractive could have been put on
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,great review tish and so smartly dressed  very sophisticated and professional  just one question thoughare you still holding that little plastic container from underneath the armrest
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,great video and a lovely car thanks
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,glad you enjoyed it
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,good review but omg i cannot think of anything more bland and boring than an electric suv ok the exception these days is any car made by vw
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,i understand that i like the ioniq 5 a lot more than this as that feels futuristic
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,with the heavy deprecation electric cars are not the way forward and no cheaper to run unless you can charge at home
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,and dont forget youll need to pony up around 1k for a home charger
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,i think the pendulum will swing again but i understand your concerns they makes sense for motability customers at the moment as big discounts and free home chargers
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,hyundai makes interesting machines somehow my taste finds their cars ugly only nissan makes uglier cars
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,i really love the look of the 5  6 what do you think of the new santa fe
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,autosocialuk i have seen a photo of the new santa fe looks boring and uninspired as if they didint know how to design a car and opted to copy the design of an old range rover and stick the hyundai logo on it seriously when you see the new santa fe doesnt it remind you of a range rover
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,"right off the bat the design it definitely has that sleek sporty appearance and it also retains some of those familiar
features that you would find in other hyundai vehicles now the kona ev had several issues in the past mainly with the battery not enough range as it proclaims and when it sparks things go boom but the konas biggest problem is the competition aside from the kia niro ev theres also uks very own mg product as in the mg zs ev trust me that is a worthy alternative because its more reliable the price is reasonable and mgs are all over the place so lets see if the kona can remove its bad reputation and be the best selling subcompact electric suv in its lineup great review as always tish"
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,ive never heard any concerns surrounding the range in fact ive always heard the opposite that theyre some at the best at achieving the predictions mgzs is definitely an opinion but there isnt as much space
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,autosocialuk  fair enough and yes the mg is lacking in space but its selling like hot cakes here in the caribbean
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,the gear shift and regen shift behind the steering wheels are almost identical to the ones on kia ev5 which is only available in china at the moment
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,many cars are now opting for this set up
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,typical hyundai over styled and over designed which always seems to make them age badly every hyundai thats a previous model always looks so dated and cheap indesign also shame about still being fwd i drive the old one and one of the things that put me off was the lack grip
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,"thats utterly rubbish and you know it if that were the case they would not be popular and there resale would be rubbish which it is not 
on fact if you look at the current i30 its actually quiet a bland car compared to the last one and this new kona is quiet bland yo compared to the last model do your whole overstyled statement us rubbish"
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,i think styling is totally subject to personal taste they have addressed the lack of grip with a smoother power deliver but its still not perfect
2024-01-15,SNFCtFiLhYQ,lol go away then thanks for telling us you know nothing about cars 
2024-01-15,SNFCtFiLhYQ,ccjh0806 as mentioned styling is subjective thats why we dont all buy the same cars there is plenty of cars on the road that one person will love the look of and another will hate
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,atto 3 has 440 l boot space
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,did i say 340
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,autosocialuk were all human just didnt want byd jumping on you
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,theres a kona hybrid now but we sadly wont get that in the us
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,this car spammed 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 videosits like as if it debuted 10000000000000000 times
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,great video tish you look amazing in this total black outfit
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,thank you for watching
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,normal spongebob
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,it was a good review tish the car has some nice featuresbut i find the current ev vehicles very bland colours not exciting just boring 
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,i know what happened with the funky lime green i saw pictures of
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,i enjoyed watching the video review one of my favourite electric cars 
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,glad you enjoyed it
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,sorry tish  that is one ugly  miss shaped  ill proportioned son of a gun  thanks for the review though 
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,tish you are going to get lost in the dark
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,"love your channel l did
have a kia nero evloved it but let down   
by the charging on a longer journey just unfortunatelyi have 
changed to a nero plug in hybridwhen are you going to some 
more car reviews with 
your friend that does car reviewsall the best 
for the new year"
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,good choice which friend 
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,great review as usual tish  love your perspective
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,thanks so much
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,not a very good car sorry to say because of one thing they dont tell is the battery cost more the the car to replace
2024-01-14,SNFCtFiLhYQ,why do you need to replace the battery
2024-07-03,yXiUrmQWCsQ,just ordered the n line s today in all black  novemberdecember time i get it 
2024-03-30,yXiUrmQWCsQ,does anyone know the length of the rear space when the seats are folded
2023-11-18,yXiUrmQWCsQ,i like the real buttons and knobs easier to use than touch controls especially when the car is moving will the 17 inch wheel also be available in the n line i prefer more range to bigger wheels
2024-02-27,yXiUrmQWCsQ,i think you can specify 17 or 19 inch wheels as a no cost option on the n line and top spec model
2023-11-18,yXiUrmQWCsQ,does new kona ev have a dash cam
2023-10-31,yXiUrmQWCsQ,waiting for release details and pricing here in australia
2023-10-27,yXiUrmQWCsQ,10 to 80 is definitely not 15 mins
2023-11-03,yXiUrmQWCsQ, more like 40 mins its not an ioniq
2023-10-26,yXiUrmQWCsQ,cant find anything on line about the new kona n or if there will even be onereally like the new interior
2023-10-26,yXiUrmQWCsQ,so there is a kona nline in the hybrid model the kona nline for the ev comes in january
2023-12-16,yXiUrmQWCsQ,the n line interior is really nice  think itd be the sweet spot of the ev range great vid guys  you do a solid job
2024-07-22,JejTMsqcLaY,so there actually is a digital speedometer  its just a setting in the instrument cluster your video just shows the classic appearance option
2024-06-17,JejTMsqcLaY,our first new car was a kona 2020  a real lemon  used a lot of oil and the car dealer said it was within limits and did nothing we will never buy a hyundai again
2024-06-15,JejTMsqcLaY,trunk opens when you stand behind it
2024-06-23,JejTMsqcLaY,dealership said my new kona sel awd does not offer ability to autoopen although i like it as it is an autoopening trunk would make it all the more likeable
2024-06-08,JejTMsqcLaY,put the key in your pocket stand directly behind the tailgate for a couple of seconds and it should open automatically i t does have  a digital speedometer
2024-05-15,JejTMsqcLaY,we bought a ltd a month ago and we really like it but with no spare available we are concerned what happens with a blowout that air compressor is going to be useless they should at least make one available very disappointed  with hyundai for that
2024-05-06,JejTMsqcLaY,the nliner trim is fcking gorgeous
2024-04-28,JejTMsqcLaY,the cameravideo images presented in this great youtube post show angles of the kona that really are appealing i am warming up to this vehicle as a result
2024-04-23,JejTMsqcLaY,mmmmkkaaayyyyylame ass place to put the gear shifter  what the actual hell  whyyy in gods name do people think up stupid shit like putting a blinker intermittent style gear shifter by the blinker  dumbest damn thing ever
2024-04-16,JejTMsqcLaY,im cross shopping this and the cx30 na i still lean towards the na cx30 lol
2024-04-14,JejTMsqcLaY,im currently driving a 2022 kona limited fwd ice and im not sure if id lease another after driving two models 2019 and 2022 instead im seriously considering the 2024 kia niro phev sx touring which uses the same 16 l engine as kona  without the turbo  but with the electric motor attached i would get 33 miles of pure ev before the gas engine kicks in i dont drive 33 miles in one day more like 10 miles a day usually that would save me a lot of money at the gas pump meanwhile the niro is about the same size but doesnt look like an armored tank like the kona plus the kia and hyundai small suv share similar interior layouts
2024-04-09,JejTMsqcLaY,the humming sound is probably the air purifier working under the drivers seat
2024-04-08,JejTMsqcLaY,hands free tailgate on the kona is not one you wave your foot under the bumper stand behind the car and stay in place for around 3 seconds lights will flash and it will open provided its activated in the infotainment system  it can be turned off
2024-04-07,JejTMsqcLaY,just bought a 2024 kona nline love her already
2024-04-04,JejTMsqcLaY,i am tired of all the reviews on just the upper trims what about the lower trims
2024-04-14,JejTMsqcLaY,keep in mind that 99 of the youtube reviews are with vehicles provided by hyundai so of course they will promote the top trims
2024-06-02,JejTMsqcLaY,agree hank drives me nuts
2024-04-02,JejTMsqcLaY,i own one of these it most certainly does have a digital speedometer you can configure from analog to digital gauges the tach even becomes digital
2024-04-07,JejTMsqcLaY,i also own one and while it does have one its not configurable to be in the middle of the gauge which is something a lot of people are used to
2024-04-07,JejTMsqcLaY,"mokurt2529 i understand ive had lots of cars where the digital speedometer is not right in the middle 
i also have a 2023 lincoln nautilus where the digital speed is on the middle but if you configured the drivers display to show other features it moves off to the side i can live with it its not a deal breaker with my hyundai or lincoln"
2024-04-09,JejTMsqcLaY,jimmoritz553 about how much to fill it up im considering a kona im looking for a primary vehicle 
2024-04-28,JejTMsqcLaY,mine projects the data onto the passenger side inner windshield
2024-04-29,JejTMsqcLaY,how are you finding your kona were thinking of picking one up next year we want the electric
2024-04-29,JejTMsqcLaY,marykay8587 i love the car i have no desire to own an ev though we drive 5000 a year so an ev is not cost effective for us and we like all wheel drive im very satisfied with the fuel economy considerably higher than rated
2024-05-04,JejTMsqcLaY,jimmoritz553 hows that ambiant lighting at night my guess is pretty sharp
2024-05-06,JejTMsqcLaY,same here about 5000 miles a year so far we really like the car and youre right the fuel economy is considerably better than what it is rated at
2024-03-31,JejTMsqcLaY,that single bar in the center of the steering wheel actually has 4 dots which is morse code for h  thats instead of having a hyundai logo
2024-04-28,JejTMsqcLaY,it actually is meant to be five dots the designers simply omit the fifth one in the north american markets
2024-03-27,JejTMsqcLaY,"we just got the awd kona limited for 31k which feels like a bargain i love everything about this suv except that the gas tank is a little small drives are very quiet and relaxing in the city but more noisy on the interstate with loud wind sounds a quiet smooth drive coupled with a very well thought out interior and cooled seats in florida makes all the difference i love this car so much that im searching for videos like this to see if im missing any of the features 

from my understanding hyundai pay allows you to pay automatically at certain parking garages

love the wireless car play and pleasantly surprised by hyundais navigation capabilities to view turn by turn directions straight ahead without having to look at the map"
2024-04-28,JejTMsqcLaY,can i ask what was the otd price i have the old version and thinking of upgrading
2024-05-02,JejTMsqcLaY,silver33we spent 31k and it was originally 38k my better half is just good at negotiating
2024-05-02,JejTMsqcLaY,shannonkharper4606 thats awesome 38k is ridiculous thank you
2024-03-19,JejTMsqcLaY,both screens are 123inch displays on the limitednline not sure about the sesel
2024-03-25,JejTMsqcLaY,123on my sel also just doesnt have navigation no matter because i use apple  carplay
2024-04-08,JejTMsqcLaY,ndi5670 im guessing you have the sel with convenience sel without convenience and se only have 123 for the infotainment from what i have seen
2024-03-14,JejTMsqcLaY,it also has a recall on it for a poorly manfactured idle stop and go feature its subject to start fires dont believe me look it up piece of crap
2024-03-22,JejTMsqcLaY,your point being
2024-04-02,JejTMsqcLaY,mine does not have idle stop start i have the limited 16 turbo
2024-04-16,JejTMsqcLaY,nice job on the review  i purchased my kona limited back in november of 2023 i chose the fwd instead knowing the back suspension would not be as good  the one thing i wish i had known was that hyundai does not include a spare tire unless its the awd  huge disappointment given that you cant even get it via 3rd party vendors otherwise after getting the ota update for wireless android auto im very happy w the car
2024-04-16,JejTMsqcLaY,what ymm do you have i have no recall nor does nhtsa list one for my 2024 kona limited 16l turbo htrac probably because it doesnt have idle startstop lol
2024-04-28,JejTMsqcLaY,patrickkenny450 we just bought one and like it but with no spare in the event of a blowout the air inflator is going to be useless
2024-06-03,JejTMsqcLaY,masterofx32 recall announcement august 2023  involving 93000 vehicles prone to fire while vehicle is parked source goggle search
2024-03-11,JejTMsqcLaY,the venue is a cuvfront drive only basically a raised hatch  the kona with awd is considered a small suvtho not really small anymorei preferred the size of the former kona and the design as well  as well in this day and age hyuandi missed the boat not offering a hybridnot all want an ev  also no body color shark fin antenna at this price point  really
2024-04-08,JejTMsqcLaY,"they offer hybrid in australia and europe

worth noting that australia doesnt get the hybrid tucson or the hybrid kia sprotage"
2024-03-11,JejTMsqcLaY,the hands free tailgate is a proximity sensor that only works if the car has been locked for at least a few minutes but if youre coming back with groceries it will know that youre standing near the trunk and open it
2024-04-08,JejTMsqcLaY,you need to stand there a moment around 3 seconds if you step away before turn signals flash it wont open
2024-04-28,JejTMsqcLaY,you are wrong the system is not designed to work that way
2024-04-28,JejTMsqcLaY,cgmiddle i literally bought this car i know how the auto tailgate works
2024-03-10,JejTMsqcLaY,im seeing a ton of this vehicles on the road im debating trading in my honda for this
2024-03-10,JejTMsqcLaY,
2024-04-29,JejTMsqcLaY,me and my husband want to pick up one next year 
2024-03-10,JejTMsqcLaY,i really love this design but i hate the mismatched irregular shape fender flairs i lean a little more toward liking the kia seltos the cousin to this kona the styling is less objectionable and its priced a few hundred dollars lower when comparably equipped given the wild styling of this vehicle i think it was a missed opportunity that hyundai didnt put some wild patterned and colored cloth upholstery in the lower trims the outside is wild and the interior is so monochromatic a strange juxtaposition the twist shifter is super cool it seems logical to use and frees up console space i wish it was a standard feature and yeah the kona has gotten awfully expensive now the kona is definitely not the value leader for the segment that honor goes to the chevy trax with a price range of about 21k27k hyundai has historically always been the value leader even undercutting domestic brands but they seem to be aiming upmarket nowadays
2024-03-23,JejTMsqcLaY,if you get the dark gray color you dont really see the fender flares
2024-03-23,JejTMsqcLaY,richdc7654 unfortunately i love the neoteric yellow which makes the black plastic fenders stand out
2024-03-10,JejTMsqcLaY,the hands free is close proximity to the tailgate with key in pocket without the need to kick
2024-03-10,JejTMsqcLaY,right  you just have to stand behind for a few seconds
2024-04-08,JejTMsqcLaY,the proximity hands free can also be disabled in the infotainment settings
2024-04-16,JejTMsqcLaY,shuikuentam1755 in addition the vehicle has to be locked
2024-03-10,JejTMsqcLaY,awesome review  i normally would have never even considered a car like this but really eyeing the ev kona
2024-03-10,JejTMsqcLaY,go for it
2024-03-10,JejTMsqcLaY,special thanks to our patrons for their support of the channel kona or crosstrek
