2024-05-23,B4pWH-80vRw,you spent more time praising the car like you were paid to than telling us the honesty depth details of the car itself
2024-05-18,B4pWH-80vRw,no one talks about how you move the seat whether its manual or electrical the stereo and whether you can rewind songs still a great video but no one goes really in depth
2024-07-02,B4pWH-80vRw,its manualand another review states the stereo is just adequate nothing special
2024-03-27,B4pWH-80vRw,where is the rails for bars 
2024-03-18,B4pWH-80vRw,im thinking about buying petrol version of jeep avenger not full electric cuz its much cheaper and affordable for me but have the same features as electric one dunno what others things  atm electric is 40k euros in my country and petrol one is around 2324k
2024-03-20,B4pWH-80vRw,i bought petrol
2024-05-23,B4pWH-80vRw,go for petrol  youll be missing nothing in terms of car comparison apart from cable charging which is pretty much a headache when you are a busy person
2024-03-09,B4pWH-80vRw,its a mokka stop talking crap
2023-12-01,B4pWH-80vRw,great design  utterly ridiculous pricing vehicle manufacturers continue to take the michael with over inflated prices
2023-11-06,B4pWH-80vRw,to me it looks like a vw tcross shape with a dacia duster front headlights not that impressive
2023-10-28,B4pWH-80vRw,good review good explanations but price is too high the touchscreen looks like someone bolted a tv to the dash funny windscreen decals dont sell the car
2023-10-23,B4pWH-80vRw,it needs to be at least 350 miles and a little bit bigger for rear passengers
2023-10-06,B4pWH-80vRw,picking ours up in the next couple of weeks its a great car full of personality
2024-02-09,B4pWH-80vRw,hey there please give me your feedback on the car i am interested in it
2024-07-05,B4pWH-80vRw,how is the car
2024-07-05,B4pWH-80vRw,msjranger no problems with it so far great little car range is around 220 summer 160170 winter motorway driving at 70mph youll get 170miles
2024-07-05,B4pWH-80vRw,kalelgreece no problems with it so far great little car range is around 220 summer 160170 winter motorway driving at 70mph youll get 170miles
2024-07-06,B4pWH-80vRw,gilestaylor8639 thank you
2023-09-21,B4pWH-80vRw,what a great looking car exciting times ahead for jeep no doubt i really like the motors that stellantis seem to be designing peugeot for one have come on leaps and bounds 
2024-02-29,B4pWH-80vRw,the sentiment is completely the opposite in north america stellantis is doing a lot of things that people are not happy with
2023-09-21,B4pWH-80vRw,"for a honest review watch matt watsons carwow review  oh wait you cant cause it was mysteriously taken down a mere few hours after it went live i saw it though it wasnt glowing 
tell me is this press review car doing the rounds the same as carwows a few weeks back
 the one that broke down 4 times with brakeelectrical issues each time matt had to sit outside the car for 520 minutes by the roadside till the car reset itself before he could drive it again
having bought a brand new picasso car of the year winner same as this in 2015 and having nothing but issues with it for 7 years straight  usually electricalengine with no customer support whatsoever i wouldnt trust any stellantis junk cars
you have been warned"
2023-09-22,B4pWH-80vRw,thanks for summarising the review for us that didnt get a chance to watch it
2023-09-22,B4pWH-80vRw,mercslrfan it is reviewed on their website  but no mention of the video review and even not a mention under the reliability section they even give it 810 
2023-09-22,B4pWH-80vRw,danielsimpson8371 thats hella fishy
2023-09-20,B4pWH-80vRw,wltp range of 250 miles a real world range of just over 200 miles maybe squeeze a few more out of it if you never leave the 30mph around town then take around 20 off those figures for winter driving and you have another ev to avoid
2023-09-20,B4pWH-80vRw,did it break down 10 times during the review just asking carwow
2023-09-20,B4pWH-80vRw,they have done an excellent job with the avenger great blend of price design and function  not an easy trick to pull off and i can see this being a very appealing car to a wide range of buyers interesting section about the cool model names as well i have a theory its actually the jeep part that makes them cool though  hillman avenger  sadness and disappointment jeep avenger  coolness and desirability see o
2023-09-20,B4pWH-80vRw,its to small for america lol
2024-02-29,B4pWH-80vRw,yep its smaller than the renegade and that was too small to sell many units
2023-09-20,B4pWH-80vRw,a mokka dressed in a jeep suita peugeot 3008 with a different dress code  ev suvs muppets will be happy
2023-09-22,B4pWH-80vRw,you are right but rather a peugeot 2008 i think considering the size  and a citroën c3 cactus etc   it basically the same junk in various designs and settings  french cars have always been great designed  nice and comfortable but they have never ever made a car without electricalelectronical faults
2023-09-20,B4pWH-80vRw,coloured dash will become a 90day car soon it will date quickly love the car but jeep still hasnt got over dismal quality i want to get to my destination
2023-09-20,B4pWH-80vRw,this car imho is overpriced overhyped and under performs on every level
2024-03-20,B4pWH-80vRw,its fun to drive
2023-09-20,B4pWH-80vRw,this praising advertising test is sure not to be removed by stellantis as the real carwow test did   i wonder what the story behind that was 
2023-09-22,B4pWH-80vRw,so weird i remember adding that to watch later then it was gone i recall the thumbnail said something like this car broke 4 times during testing its a shit suv either way
2024-07-06,vqJX4FuVB2g,and the old american petrol cans usually called gerry cans were copies of the german ww2  petrol cans hence the name gerry can
2024-06-27,vqJX4FuVB2g,i really enjoyed the journalist reasonable opinion not positive or negative just as it is i was in love with the avenger but now i doubt i will look further maybe a duster
2024-06-26,vqJX4FuVB2g,i drove a compass once before it was the worst car i ever drove felt cheap felt like a tin can the wheel fucked up the brakes made weird noises it had zero power or pull literally just a car for if you dont know any better
2024-06-25,vqJX4FuVB2g,who here from gta five update
2024-06-25,vqJX4FuVB2g,broke down four times with matt and the video is no longer available
2024-06-18,vqJX4FuVB2g,is he really tall or is it really small  i thought jeeps were huge 
2024-06-17,vqJX4FuVB2g,thats for wrangler owners
2024-06-08,vqJX4FuVB2g,the jeep wave is for real jeeps wranglers the 4 door wranglers may not even get a wave
2024-06-05,vqJX4FuVB2g,basically just an electric vauxhall mokka
2024-05-04,vqJX4FuVB2g,looks retro
2024-05-02,vqJX4FuVB2g,this was a bloody good review
2024-05-02,vqJX4FuVB2g,good jeep let me see what dollars behind it with availability in asia pakistan
2024-04-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,yes you can get in with a petrol engine
2024-03-30,vqJX4FuVB2g,of course theres lots of plastic its american made rory lol
2024-03-26,vqJX4FuVB2g,when natural calamities hit and the power grid falls apart its the internal combustion engine thats going to work
2024-03-25,vqJX4FuVB2g,sounds like shite in every category
2024-03-08,vqJX4FuVB2g,towing weight of 0kg make it useless in finland  where everybody is moving around fire wood
2024-03-06,vqJX4FuVB2g,do european cars not normally make a ticking noise when the turn signals activated
2024-03-02,vqJX4FuVB2g,india launch
2024-02-29,vqJX4FuVB2g,looks like awd is coming soon
2024-02-26,vqJX4FuVB2g,in my country  car of the year 2024 is toyota chr
2024-02-23,vqJX4FuVB2g,i remember when jeep use to rival land rover
2024-02-19,vqJX4FuVB2g,most jeep wrangler drivers wouldnt acknowledge any other type of jeep as legitimate
2024-02-18,vqJX4FuVB2g,why cant i find the 12ltr turbo petrol version
2024-03-19,vqJX4FuVB2g,only in italy or spain afaik
2024-02-17,vqJX4FuVB2g,jeep wave and ducking is mostly only for wranglers and gladiators aka true 4x4 vehicles not suv mall crawlers
2024-02-13,vqJX4FuVB2g,será bem vindo no brasil
2024-02-13,vqJX4FuVB2g,i got a petrol one
2024-02-07,vqJX4FuVB2g,hybrid is only 74 kw 101 bhpwow
2024-02-04,vqJX4FuVB2g,yawn another ipad on wheels
2024-02-02,vqJX4FuVB2g,yellow mellow very portable
2024-02-02,vqJX4FuVB2g,very nice
2024-01-31,vqJX4FuVB2g,"jeep wave and ducking are for wrangler only
the wrangler 4xe is the womens car of the year not the model of jeep you are reviewing"
2024-01-26,vqJX4FuVB2g,these car of the year awards smell to me it sounds like a payola  send our jurists on allexpenses paid jollies and maybe something under the table and in return we award you a title you can use to fool consumers into buying the car the smell for 2023 was especially bad considering the jeep didnt even go into mass production until late 2023 and yet won in january and when it did turn up people agreed it was a nice looking car but unreliable and underwhelming
2024-01-24,vqJX4FuVB2g,010 buddy that has to be a real jeep as in a wrangler not an italian econobox
2024-01-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,ive been waiting 2 years for parts for my 2014 jeep grand cherokee that unlocks the steering wheel so the car can drive jeep cannot provide me the parts they have told me that manufacturing stopped during covid and has never started back up they held 2000 in cash for 15 months until i finally demanded it back as they couldnt get the part a contractor working on my house has a brand new 2023 model thats 6 months old and its been sitting in jeep waiting for parts for 6 weeks whilst he drives a loan car they told him not to put my km on it  the circus around the carwow video and the cover up to hide this should be a warning to anyone considering a car from jeep or the larger stellantis group and any of their brands to avoid all of them you dont need to be a genius to recognise a sinking ship
2024-01-17,vqJX4FuVB2g,so auto trader couldnt find there own favourite bit of road so just copy harrys garage and go on his lazy journalism
2024-01-12,vqJX4FuVB2g,more stellantis rubbish look great but i cant see this being a decent ev
2024-01-10,vqJX4FuVB2g,cupple of cans of water 
2024-01-05,vqJX4FuVB2g,it may be a good machine but it looks ugly there are far better looking cars in the market
2023-12-28,vqJX4FuVB2g,"the interior of the jeep avenger feels like a budget car with a premium price
seriously not only jeep but the american car brands keep getting worse think about chrysler chevrolet jeep the exception for now might be ford that still makes a competitive cars"
2023-12-24,vqJX4FuVB2g,i have only seen the wave in a landrover
2023-12-23,vqJX4FuVB2g,in the us the jeep wave is just a wrangler thing is it different in europe
2023-12-16,vqJX4FuVB2g,nyc car
2023-12-12,vqJX4FuVB2g,the jeep wave is only done by wrangler owners not just any other jeep
2023-12-04,vqJX4FuVB2g,jeeps are plastic orientated inside my 05 liberty is very plastic inside but it is basically a tank if you want luxury you dont buy a jeep
2023-11-29,vqJX4FuVB2g,jeep
2023-11-18,vqJX4FuVB2g,"easy to watch this guy 
cheers"
2023-11-16,vqJX4FuVB2g,its a peugeot 2008 with different body and trim parts
2023-11-14,vqJX4FuVB2g,many many years ago when i used to drive my old dads reliant robin it was customary that if you saw another reliant that you waved to them to be fair i would say that 85 of drivers did actually wave back i think this is mainly because a lot of three wheeler drivers were actually exmotorcyclist and traditionally most bikes wave at each other even to this day if i am out on the motorbike most other riders will either nod or wave to you
2023-11-07,vqJX4FuVB2g,not trying to offend anyone but honestly havent been able to understand why some ppl love jeep clearly from this video it doesnt look very comfortable for the passengers and mercedes def win the interior awards
2023-10-27,vqJX4FuVB2g,96 seconds to 60 for an electric car is simply unacceptable
2023-10-26,vqJX4FuVB2g,only reason its electric is because of a school child
2023-10-26,vqJX4FuVB2g,i had jeep renagade trailhawk  when they came out in 2015 loved it bit loads problems it locked all its doors  took dealer three months to fix
2023-10-24,vqJX4FuVB2g,i dont like wherehow the chosed to cut the bumper line it looks cheap and i forsee alot of broken bumper tabs problems nice car though
2023-10-24,vqJX4FuVB2g,mg4 is way better isnt it
2023-10-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,its a sad state of affairs that this effort is european car of the year our european neighbours will decide with their pockets i dont expect to see many of these on uk roads  we will see
2023-10-23,vqJX4FuVB2g,come home son the continent wants you
2023-10-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,wtf the dodge avenger coupe from the mid 90s become a mid size sedan in the late 2000s and now is eletric jeep
2023-10-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,i find myself in eco mode in stellantis cars  you still get the full power when you floor it in that mode
2023-10-19,vqJX4FuVB2g,the jeep wave is for actual jeeps like willys cj2 3 5 7 wranglers gladiators  that sort of jeep all other jeeps are basically marketing
2023-10-19,vqJX4FuVB2g,very good review and pretty much the same thoughts about the jeep as i had after driving it twice it is far too expensive for its size top spec should be at least 5000 s cheaper especially  when compared to the chinese opposition top marks though for the italian design and french engine technology i just hope the heat pump works well here in finland at the moment you cant preheat for charging stops something that is urgently needed in an update when driving in minus 20c conditions
2023-10-19,vqJX4FuVB2g,jeepers creepers  couldnt help myself 
2023-10-19,vqJX4FuVB2g,great car review mate
2023-10-18,vqJX4FuVB2g,jeep waving and ducking is just for wranglers
2023-10-17,vqJX4FuVB2g,oh my god i thought it was renault terrano
2023-10-17,vqJX4FuVB2g,plastic  more rugged hurrdurr
2023-10-17,vqJX4FuVB2g,car interior and exteriors have been covered in plastic since at least the early 1980s
2023-10-15,vqJX4FuVB2g,jeep should be ashamed of itself 2wd borrowing the name from dodge forcing an ev on peoplepure laziness side note the jeep wave  ducking apply only to wranglersand gladiators if youre feeling generous
2023-10-14,vqJX4FuVB2g,kindly check tata harrier
2023-10-14,vqJX4FuVB2g,it looks like dacia model
2023-10-13,vqJX4FuVB2g,after how many miles most parts have been replaced
2023-10-13,vqJX4FuVB2g,what a un ugly car
2023-10-12,vqJX4FuVB2g,i hope they make an ev out of this it would be a banger
2023-10-13,vqJX4FuVB2g,yeah i dont like the exhaust on this one
2023-10-17,vqJX4FuVB2g,elaba_ 
2023-10-10,vqJX4FuVB2g,"your delusional
its not worth 20 k 
i would say its a box of plastic"
2023-10-09,vqJX4FuVB2g,a jeep the worlds best car how many back handers do they give these reviewers this will depreciate like a stone
2023-10-09,vqJX4FuVB2g,the presence of a lot of plastic can be put down to fiat being the owner of them now or stallantis as its now known and unfortunately fiats plastics as we know form the 500 age horribly look up reviews of used 500s and all of the colouring has come off of the limited edition colour parts theyre surface coloured and not colour through so the moment they wear they either show through white or black depending on the base colour of the plastic substrate that will almost certainly happe with that coloured dash panel
2023-10-09,vqJX4FuVB2g,now i can modify my dacia duster into this
2023-10-09,vqJX4FuVB2g,looks like duster
2023-10-08,vqJX4FuVB2g,stellantis really needs to stop naming cars avenger theyve recycled this nameplate so many timesthe only one anybody liked was the original usspec coupe
2023-10-08,vqJX4FuVB2g,the jeep wave applies to wranglers and gladiators my friendsorry
2023-10-08,vqJX4FuVB2g,i wouldnt exchange my 3 years old peugeot 2008  with this pile of crap even now its rubbish
2023-10-08,vqJX4FuVB2g,of course not its a jeep
2023-10-08,vqJX4FuVB2g,safety rating euro ncap please it seems it is 3 star only
2023-10-07,vqJX4FuVB2g,black jeeps wave to other black jeeps
2023-10-07,vqJX4FuVB2g,i think we can all thank stellantis for this i drivena  couple of renegades from fca times whi then were cheapest jeeps and built quality was way better
2023-10-07,vqJX4FuVB2g,why quote the wltp range as a good thing when we all know its a lie
2023-10-07,vqJX4FuVB2g,we quoted real world efficient too
2023-10-06,vqJX4FuVB2g,save 3k on the matching fiat unless polish jeeps are your jam jeep is a branding empire more than anything
2024-02-11,vqJX4FuVB2g,whats the matching fiat called
2023-10-06,vqJX4FuVB2g,the movement of the interior has immediately put me off
2023-10-05,vqJX4FuVB2g,96 seconds to 60 is pretty darn good for an electric jeep i bought a 1972 alfa romeo 2000 gtv veloce with twin camssodium cooled valvesfuel injection and that was the 060 timesand in that day that was one of the fastest small cars availableso the jeep is pretty fast
2023-10-07,vqJX4FuVB2g,because something was fast 50 years ago doesnt mean its fast now  96 is painfully slow and north of 60mph would be horrific
2023-10-09,vqJX4FuVB2g,chrishannibal5309 i feel like my old 2003 tacoma use to to 60 in 7 seconds
2023-11-25,vqJX4FuVB2g,my car dose 0 to 60 in about the same time believe me its pretty slow
2024-01-14,vqJX4FuVB2g,96s for that price tag is slow same price on an ice car would be much better than that
2023-10-05,vqJX4FuVB2g,the reason i like cars like this is because they are higher and when you are in a car thats high you dont feel as much the distance
2023-10-05,vqJX4FuVB2g,it looks like a dacia duster
2023-10-05,vqJX4FuVB2g,jeep and car of the year 
2023-10-04,vqJX4FuVB2g,using the avenger name is like using a retired players number let the dodge avenger rest in peace pieces
2023-10-04,vqJX4FuVB2g,but its ugly
2023-10-04,vqJX4FuVB2g,great review this was very helpful and crystal clear explanation
2023-10-04,vqJX4FuVB2g,thats a telltale sign storage areas are poorly sized when car companies quote their capacities in arbitrary measurements like rubber ducks and pingpong balls 
2023-10-03,vqJX4FuVB2g,which year
2023-10-03,vqJX4FuVB2g,"you would have to a complete idiot to buy a jeep product in europe i say this as someone who is on their 12th jeep since i have moved back to europe i was completely shocked how badly jeep treats their customers the dealer network is a special kind of hell they do whatever they can to deny warranty claims i had this situation several times on a wrangler with 12k kms on the clock 
do not buy a jeep if you live in europe"
2023-10-03,vqJX4FuVB2g,not a jeep
2023-10-03,vqJX4FuVB2g,cant get excited about evs
2023-10-03,vqJX4FuVB2g,jeep wave only works in real jeeps like wrangler 
2023-10-03,vqJX4FuVB2g,wonderful review as always 
2023-10-03,vqJX4FuVB2g,worlds best joke
2023-10-02,vqJX4FuVB2g,"shot answer no
long answer noooooooo"
2023-10-02,vqJX4FuVB2g,i had an original avenger in the 70s that thing went wrong on a regular basis and i think this will do the same jeep and cheap are synonymous for a reason
2023-10-02,vqJX4FuVB2g,electric dull the go green people have no clue how these electrics are stupid i also dont understand why we have a separate world womens panel of reviewers is this a new gender or something they are and can be part of the existing organisations and agencies why there is separate endorsement and patronage most of all the ambitious ones dont fantasize budget or efficient cars anyways even if it is the world car of the year
2023-10-02,vqJX4FuVB2g,didnt know this existed
2023-10-02,vqJX4FuVB2g,great review but the car looks so cheap
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,just 249 miles range 
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,every electric car is a shitbox
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,jeep wave and duck duck jeep is only done by the jeeple in wranglers and gladiators
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,im a fan of this car but the price is ridiculous for a small car with 4 year old electric car tech its going to get destroyed by the volvo ex30 and the fisker pear when they arrive both will be the same money but years ahead in terms of tech and design its a pity stellantis couldve done a dacia and sold off the old tech at a knock down price personally i dont get what the premium price gets you better residuals
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,jeep in the uk  its strange
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,suzuki sj and vitara owners have done the wave for years
2023-09-30,vqJX4FuVB2g,junk junk and more junk jeep is a super cheap junky over priced car it will be bankrupt in 5 years for less this is a peugeot
2023-09-30,vqJX4FuVB2g,i swear the jeep wave is more for actual jeeps like the wrangler in london if im in the wrangler other wrangler owners almost always wave
2023-09-30,vqJX4FuVB2g,most importantly we now have a new word for the dictionary ensmallen beautifully stated im thinking  resmallen maybe better
2023-09-30,vqJX4FuVB2g,looks like a kia
2023-09-30,vqJX4FuVB2g,agreed with you jeep is best of the best i love another brands still having add their brand value by no mean reality but jeep another side
2023-09-29,vqJX4FuVB2g,you obviously didnt watch jeepers creepers
2023-09-28,vqJX4FuVB2g,no one has mentioned the fact that it looks to be a compass  in styling and spec  just with a few tweaks
2023-09-28,vqJX4FuVB2g,i like the looks outside and inside though the transmission tunnel and overly narrow middle rear seat make it a 4seater for a couple with young children wonder what the euroncap rating will be will it roll in the offset
2023-09-28,vqJX4FuVB2g,its landrover wave
2023-09-27,vqJX4FuVB2g,fyi uk is situated in europe
2023-09-27,vqJX4FuVB2g,world car doesnt equal best car its meant to have the greatest impact and value for money also untrue that jeep doesnt address urban families the cherokee has done that for decades
2023-09-27,vqJX4FuVB2g,an ev with 150hp sounds fine to me 80hp in an ev of that size sounds absurd
2023-09-26,vqJX4FuVB2g,the new volvo ex30 is a similar starting price is more modern faster safer better equipped charges faster and is just all round better quality struggling to see how the jeep is in any way interesting or competitive let alone car of the year
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,i think it won because its a likeable car theres nothing inoffensive about it its practical and well designed impractical flawed or expensive cars win car of the year all of the time sometimes really dull stuff wins i think this is a decent all rounder though the price is pretty steep the ex30 and the fisker pear will blow this out of the water though it has a head start before values go through the floor i guess thats the story with all of the current crop of evs though the tech is moving so fast
2023-09-26,vqJX4FuVB2g,ive only experienced the jeep wave in a wrangler or gladiator not other normal jeeps
2023-09-26,vqJX4FuVB2g,why is this the car of the yearit is just a regular ev car with a disappointing range bad quality interior and overpriced
2023-09-26,vqJX4FuVB2g,"of course not those titles are being bought is a known practice already
theres nothing car of the year about this crossdressing fiat
is a tiny lifted hatchback with a stupid high price
this is not a jeep a fun serious offroader but a vehicle for the metrosexual libertarian minds the poosers 
its a small hatchback sold for the price of a premium sport sedan with double its power and great performance tesla model 3
this crossdressing fiat would be ok if the price were right aka 30000 eur for the top trim based on what it offers"
2023-09-26,vqJX4FuVB2g,a pre production model
2023-09-26,vqJX4FuVB2g,did they slightly maybe by a factor of 1 or so change the font of avenger on the doors since the last vid of the avenger you did 
2023-09-25,vqJX4FuVB2g,there is no such thing as the jeep wave so gullible
2023-09-25,vqJX4FuVB2g,"the more time you spend with it the more you like it  
the same thing i think about my money"
2023-09-25,vqJX4FuVB2g,you are a very generous man you said so many nice things about a 12000 vehicle being sold for 30000
2023-09-25,vqJX4FuVB2g,the shift controls look just like a fiat 500s hmmmm
2023-09-24,vqJX4FuVB2g,my thought process after the review  jeepers creepers who like to duck
2023-09-24,vqJX4FuVB2g,36k for a plastic interior no thanks
2023-09-24,vqJX4FuVB2g,the jeep wave is for wranglers atleast in the tj days and before not sure if it still is
2023-09-23,vqJX4FuVB2g,hey rory autotrader the main question is is it better than peugeot e2008 e2008 seems a slightly more premium design better interiors and more practical whats your take
2023-10-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,jeep is a bit softer and has stronger parts used in the suspension at least thats what they told us 
2023-09-23,vqJX4FuVB2g,so if im between this smart 1 and volvo ex30 which one is better
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,ive been sitting in a fiat 600e recently  basically a twoseater as opposed to the smart 1 which is more comparable to a vw id3 in terms of interior space the smart is  and i guess the ex30 will be  a pretty decent offering overall
2023-09-23,vqJX4FuVB2g,fuel 
2023-09-23,vqJX4FuVB2g,synthetic
2023-09-23,vqJX4FuVB2g,what a joke were making noises in these stupid battery toys  crap
2023-09-23,vqJX4FuVB2g,missed the opportunity to name it evenger
2023-09-23,vqJX4FuVB2g,please make more motorcycle videos too
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,no jeep wave and ducks are a wrangler thing
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,the trouble was the car of the year award was brought out before the car was released not as good as what jeep wanted people to think also it is a peugeot underneath
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,how can it be the best car of the year when it has to charge before 1000 km
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,a car called jeep  ill  never spend my money to buy its ugly look and money pit
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,this is not a jeep but some cheap european rubbish from fiat
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,the jeep avenger is a beautiful electric car it should be exported to the usa
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,why are you slagging jeep its not german italian  not forgetting its not britishhow much are you getting paid for your singular opinion
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,"this is one of the things that bugs me car of the year awards at the beginningearly part of the year its just a marketing con it makesabsolutely no sense for a cunsumers point of view why not near the end of the year when they have all the new makesmodels even versionslevel of trims and vitally some sense of reliabilty of cars that have been released during the year in question i mean heck if they had awarded this jeep all these awards and then found out that an engine component regularly lunched the motor or another compnent necessitated the mass recall of the car be it safety or whatever a number of months later well certainly an egg on faces moment eh 
you wouldnt give a crap tonne of awards to a movie say before it was released to the audiences would you it could very well flop big style well as is common these days
to me car of the year awards and the magazines that give them are just moronic its all just a scam and nothing more i prefer to read reviews on what has been out at least a year to get the true sense of what cars or whatever i personally am looking to buy to learn and understand what exactly is and isnt a good product with regards to build quality reliability and value 
"
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,so many easter eggs in the windows i guess this is just jeep trying to avoid people that have to replace glass to go for a 3rd party ahahaa
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,metal bumpers are illegal since 1980s just to let you know
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,so basically they paid someone for that car of the year badge loads of plastic limited boot space no frunk limited innovation and a shit stereo rightmoving along
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,340 miles would require an efficiency of 63 miles per kwh really
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,thats the official urban wltp figure unlikely but plausible
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,"interesting review
not all of the superheroes wear capes they drive around in an electric  yellow jeep avenger
thinking it looks good its different from all the mundane european boxes that are on our roads
shame about the build quality black moveable plastic no arm rest or ventilation in the rear what about the 2443 rubber ducks in the boot
is it car of the year no i have to agree there are much better cars like the 
ferrari purosangue one of your best reviews stunningly beautiful location and an awesome car
at the end of the day 
its a jeep its different even though it has a starting price at 36k rising to over 40k will people buy it you know they will"
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,we are witnessing a huge marketing effort to help a esential corporate product appeal as much people as possible when its clearly a lemon
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,whats with so many car reviewers using roads around chipping norton in oxfordshire here is rory using the road from charlbury to burford through the wychwood forest the same one harry metcalf uses for his reviews and matt watson generally uses the roads around deddington and out towards enstone just a few miles to the east  could it be that they all live in the area harry certainly does or are they members of soho farmhouse at great tew  or is it the clarkson farm tractor beam sucking them into the area around jeremys gaff at chadlington  curious
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,the uk press launch of this car happened took place in that area so most of us went to a location to pick the car up
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,thanks for taking the trouble to reply  i recognised the road the film was made on as i live in the area and use it regularly  it just amused me that lots of road tests seem to take place in the proximity of diddly squat farm
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,jeep wave is only for wranglers if im not mistaken
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,europeanen car ot the year i can honestly say i have never seen one over here in the netherlands but it looks oke
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,are other youtube channels allowed to film on harrys favourite bit of road  
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,i like it when you say that is not the end of the world because actually this car can hardly get us to the end of the world
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,same route as where harry m does his epic reviews
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,no no it isnt
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,looks cheap and nasty to me
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,i live in london and have yet to see one of these on the road
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,ive had jeeps for the past decade or more but you lost me as soon as bev was mentioned i need something that can tow
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,2023 coty with 100kw max charging hardly pushing a boundary fo an award
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,has this one broken down yet  lol
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,whoever gives out these awards should not work in this business there is nothing under the stellantis brand ever worthy of such an honor they are all over priced plastic on wheels that dont last such a shame
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,man it looks tighttoo small
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,its an ugly bug
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,i still have no idea why this car won the award
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,because they desperately need a selling point
2023-09-27,vqJX4FuVB2g,because of envelopes under the table 
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,why has every modern car body be 30 made of plastic 
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,plastic means oil means long term pain
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,i stopped the vid after i heard all electric boring car
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,i wont get that for free
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,a cobbled together car out of the group parts bin may be ok ish but car of the year etc no way at all
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,showing your age repeatedly in this video lol
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,isnt this the car mat watson tested for carwow and it broke down on him 3 times then a day later the video for the car was taken of the channel 
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,great news as the government has extended the sales of ice and diesel car i can see ev sales dropping
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,1000 does this means it remembers its latest setting and doesnt fall back to a standard mode thats cool and not always a given i remember from other reviews in the past of cars that reverted back to a standard setting everytime you restarted the car
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,the jeep wave only  applies to the wrangler
2023-10-03,vqJX4FuVB2g,was just going to write the same thing other cars in the jeep lineup are just cars they are not jeeps
2023-10-12,vqJX4FuVB2g,well with modern jeeps anyway
2023-11-29,vqJX4FuVB2g,jeep wave applies to the cj not the wrangler
2024-01-31,vqJX4FuVB2g,"amass16
too bad most cj were in junk yards now"
2024-02-10,vqJX4FuVB2g,nah xj
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,its definately not a jeep just another stellantis mongrel ok it is a utility vehicle that so having lots of plastic is fine making it easy to keep clean but 36000 they are having a joke now if they had made it a four wheel drive with true off road ability then they might have been on to something come on rory say what you really think
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,using harry metcalfes road is a bit rude i hope you asked his permission first 
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,"eather this or the dacia duster are copying one another 

also this just not look like a jeep first time i saw it  what the duster has a facelift"
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,"looks like 35k quid dacia duster 


dont get me wrong it looks better than dacia duster and probably drives better but otherwise its just dacia duster to me"
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,"ensmallen the aperture bravo  

saw it in person last week at car show as a renegade owner i was totally underwhelmed"
2023-09-27,vqJX4FuVB2g,ensmallen its a perfectly cromulent word  
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,looking at it n am not getting any jeep vibes whatsoever
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,is this the car from batman vs superman
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,does nobody know what plastic is made from
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,it was fine as a corsa alternative if it started at 20k upto 30 then ok starting at 36not a hope in hell
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,strange how we need electric memory seats these days i have them but be honest i prefer manual faster to move
2023-09-24,vqJX4FuVB2g,if you are sharing a car regularly with someone memory seats are essential you dont get memory seats with manually adjustable poverty spec seats
2023-09-27,vqJX4FuVB2g,on my tesla model 3 each driver has a profile in the car that remembers everything from seat position mirror and steering wheel position safety settings control customisations preferred temperature and it recognises who gets in and adjusts everything for you when you get in  given i am 63 and my wife is 55 its amazingly convenient and im not sure how i will do without it if my next car doesnt do all that for me  
2024-07-17,vqJX4FuVB2g,brianw1612 my porsche gt3 rs doesnt have memory seats get im in poverty 
2024-07-17,vqJX4FuVB2g,cplayzgamez  thats great but my point still stands
2024-07-17,vqJX4FuVB2g,brianw1612 yup  those darn bugatti owners are in poverty
2024-07-17,vqJX4FuVB2g,"cplayzgamez  you are clearly missing the point so ill help you out a bugatti or gt3 rs arent daily drivers  they sure as hell arent going to be driven by several people throughout a day 

the jeep avenger though its a family car the mum will drive it the dad will drive it constantly readjusting mirrors seats  steering wheel every time you jump in a car is a real nuisance electric memory seats solve this issue entirely  are an absolute must have for any car i own that someone more than just me will drive

now hop along back to your fantasy garage of porsches  bugattis "
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,the duck thing is amazing my friend has a wrangler we went camping in west virginia came out of the general store and there was a rubber duck sitting on his hood the lady to started the foundation just happened to be there her son had passed from cancer so for the funeral she asked people with jeeps to comeamazingly almost 200 jeeps from across the us showed check it out thats why jeepers duck
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,ive only ever owned 1 jeep never ever again terrible cars
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,back seat is a depressing place to be cost cutting going crazy with no rear centre armrest 
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,nice little hatch   why slap a jeep badge on it since it doesnt have any jeepiness  why debase the brand
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,looks like a car thats all show and no go
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,the jeep wave only pertains to those who drive wranglers but the ducking is for all jeep owners to participate in
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,i love the brand i have a wk2  a bu i think this looks great but the cheap plastics and lack of awd is disappointing
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,"the american style x petrol cans are known as jerry cans
jerry was the offensive name for the enemy ending with the sound y that was adopted by the us for the germans in ww2 see also charlie haji
jerry cans were known as such because they were what the germans had as with most things german they had actual engineering in their design unlike allied cans which were mainly made of tin foil
dan dun dun dun
rainbow star"
2023-10-13,vqJX4FuVB2g,it reminds me of a mouse
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,the jeep wave where i live is just between wranglers you know real jeeps 
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,the jeep wave is for wranglers cjs etc   real off road jeeps
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,thats not a jeep no 4 wheel drive and no 4x4  its not a jeep
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,hi rory great video again but i do miss more direct and tough conclusion this plastic car is obviously a huge mistake you say it your self an american jeep that will never be sold in usa why because its not a real jeep huge fail
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,jeep charokee lil brother on silent mode
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,car of the year is s scam since ages and actually it makes anti advertising for cleaver people this days
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,watch the carwow video review and avoid this car
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,nice review
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,europe does things better so are electric cars getting better this one might be the best i have seen
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,"the car of the year is toyota corolla hybrid estate 2lt version for me all you need from a car 
economy space sportiness reliability what else you need"
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,jeep joke  what does jeep stand for just empty every pocket
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,"mat from carwow  gave it a shortlist despite the fact it broke down 4 times during the review and he clearly hated it wonder how much jeep paid him the video was taken down shortly after wonder why

the car looks horrifically cheap and jeep are one of the most unreliable brands out there"
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,the interior is soo cheap looking  it really isnt good enough for a 2023 car
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,good review the car seems to me to be a perfect example of how to sell a cheaply built car for lot of money but arent they all the same these days id personally rather buy a one or two year old high spec german car for the same money but thats just my opinion
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,never buy a jeep with their awful reliability
2023-10-04,vqJX4FuVB2g,ishdeephora5077 never buy a jeep a peugeot or a vauxhall
2023-10-24,vqJX4FuVB2g,"both a brand new jeep and 12 yo german car are going to be about as reliable as each other 
buy japanese or korean instead"
2023-10-24,vqJX4FuVB2g,gdsamplify its not just the reliability its the overall build quality is st with stelantis vehicles i speak from experience
2023-12-04,vqJX4FuVB2g,ishdeephora5077 im driving an 05 jeep cherokeelibby and no issues
2023-12-11,vqJX4FuVB2g,a perfect example of how to sell a cheap plasticy car for a lot of moneywelcome to most evs lol
2024-03-19,vqJX4FuVB2g,and spend half of the purchase price on repairs as soon as the factory warranty expires it blows my mind that people still think german cars are reliable quality  of assembly and materials does not automatically equate to durability or dependability but the german pr spin machine is strong
2024-03-19,vqJX4FuVB2g,redline589 ive had vastly different experiences so maybe owner  driver error
2024-03-19,vqJX4FuVB2g,carlosf6828spending  half the purchase price on repairs after the warranty expires would be an enormous amount of money for which any manufacturer would rightly so gain bad press for i dont know this to be the case for any manufacturer unless you have evidence to the contrary
2024-03-19,vqJX4FuVB2g,carlosf6828yeah drivers side window falling into the door on a cold day using the electric window switch is driver error lol
2024-03-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,redline589 we have two stellantis products and theyve been pretty problem free for the several years weve owned them but ive replaced failing window regulators on other makes ive owned both on a honda element and on my audi tt thats not an issue unique to stellantis cars
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,did you say 36kcant wait for the arrival of chinese brands en masse these car companies are milking us even tesla dropped their prices recently they kmow whats coming
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,my shoe is bigger than this car said arnold shweger once
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,and by the way its been judged by rory its going to be removed as well
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,it has been reviewed by carwow and since its given an atrocious result has been removed never to find
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,got their money out of that b roll shot
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,hmm i have 36k to spend on a new electric car which should i go for the jeep avenger or the mg4 xpower tough decision 
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,neither
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,mrmannyhw i dont imagine you would buy an electric car of any description
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,jeremyradford5103 most likely would get tesla 3 or polestar 2  
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,mrmannyhw  great cars but considerably more expensive i love my model 3 and wouldnt change it for the world but it was 50k new and more than many can afford
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,"with this awful interior finish hard plastic everywhere that comes loose and overpriced as small ev how did this car won the european title
and on the other side the brilliant mg4 didnt even get to the 7 finalists"
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g, same way they got mat from carwow to give it a shortlist when he clearly hated it and it broke down on him 4 times in a single drive
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,rory reid is a rock star but that jeep is minging and oxfordshire county council should be charging rent one the use of harrys corner
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,swear thats a dacia
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,car of the year
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,how much was the bribe
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,car of the year a jeep uh  no
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,america doesnt want it its electric its ugly and not capable enough my 2012 jeep liberty looks better than that also he never got the memo either the jeep wave and ducks are only for wranglers
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,20 seconds inadvertcome onnnn
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,there is really nothing wrong with the design of this thing my problem is that it is electric and has allthese annoying nannys and beeps and safety tech that real car people dont want or needthen again most real car people wont buy this thing 
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,all modern cars have the same safety tech for euro ncap nothing to do with being an ev
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,dreadpirateflappy yeah thats not what i said i mewnt 2 seperate things i dont like it number 1 becauae it is electric and number 2 because it has all that stupid tech nobody needs if they would dtay off their phones while driving and just drive
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,plastics made out of fossil fuel off course nut zero the gift that keeps on giving
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,possibly but using it to fuel the car and then wasting 70 of it in thermal losses would be doubly stupid
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,a fiat jeep for southern europe i guess
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,im guessing its about  12k on the road yeah 
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,i would personally prefer a voice without a background music
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,the interior design is very disappointing  i love the exterior though
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,this jeeplooks cheap not in a good way
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,the question to be asked here is to what extent is the avenger environmentally friendly or responsibly moving towards sustainable energy considering the amount of plastic they are using just in one car i think its high time automakers seriously consider the materials with respect to sustainability when designing and engineering a vehicleprofit at the cost of the environment when you are yourself trying to show that you are moving towards a more sustainable future doesnt portray very promising endeavors and is a cheap shot
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,true but plastic can be recycled
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,it doesnt use 17000 litres of fossil fuels in its lifeit can use renewables so its very green  much greener than an ice car
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,if you allow for 50 mpg a petrol car produces 2 tonnes of co2e every 10k miles allowing for 4 miles per kwh this ev will produce 490 kg of co2e every 10k miles
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,nice look  but its a jeep consumers reports 
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,great review we need this cute jeep on the other side of the atlantic ie canada
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,rory when will we see the i20n performance review 
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,i call it the jeep wanker wave 
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,they have also confirmed a petrol engine version for the uk market think i would have that looks great though
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,broke down 4 times in the carwow review
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,carbage of the year
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,"jeep drivers are always friendly you see them happily chatting away in laybys as they await the breakdown recovery service   8

2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,great video as usual less great unreliable car 
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,ill stick with my enyaq thanks
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,rory i think it only applies to the jeep wranglers that will wave at each other  they think all other jeep are posers  its like the bikers that always wave to other bikers
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,looks great but inside interior is not good
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,to each their own to me its just a pug or vauxhall in a different outfit its not a jeep in the old sense and not for me i wont be leaving any ducks on it 
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,its the alfa romeo tonale underneath
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,just a rebadged fiat 600    exact same interior
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,its gonna be in the shop every 10k miles
2023-09-23,vqJX4FuVB2g,so its extremely environmentally friendly then
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,i see only fiat 500x 
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,the thing about plastic is it lasts forever on car interiors as the japanese have proved since the late 80s it all wears well and is hardy and sturdy compared to soft touch alternatives so while the car is built to a price i bet these will be like roaches in 20 years assuming batteries can be replaced
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,yeah they definitely built this thing with longevity in mind lol
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,mg4 is 26k is this 10k better
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,wave is for traditional jeeps  wranglers
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,thats the same road that the old geeza harrys garage uses cotswolds yh rory is living
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,isnt harry mad you stole his playground  
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,"hello mate 

people with a robin reliant  did that lol"
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,autotrader amazing editing the new style suits your channel with a combo of rorys review autotrader have a car like a bugatti and do this editing style you will gain a new fan base amzaing job editor
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,no issues with the style of the jeep it is extremely similar to the vauxhall mokka no surprise as its the same company my biggest worry which is a well founded one is depreciation look at prices new on peugeot vauxhall  citroën they are all being discounted plus the mokka drops in value like crazylike 50 in 3 years
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,oh come on it is a stellantis group car with all the inherent quality issues of those carwow mat reviewed it and it had four 4 failures every time a breaking system alarm i got a 2007 toyota yaris that has done 344000 km and it got perfect breaks and no alarms ever you got to be a car journalist to like a car like that even if i were in to evs what about the fact that it competes directly in price with much better cars like hyundai ioniq 5 kia ev 6 and mg4 all with 7 year warranty actually it is smaller than the hyundai kona or kia eniro which also are cheaper got better warranty got better battery packs longer range and more power
2023-10-03,vqJX4FuVB2g,you lost me with mg4 a travesty that you would compare that with ioniq 5 and ev6 i would get a jeep avenger over an mg4 any day of the week and for the other two they are significantly more expensive and not directly comparable to the avenger
2024-04-11,vqJX4FuVB2g,never buy a hyundai or kia ev  they are unsafe as hell  a lot of hyundai and kia ev are called back for fire risk
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,ensmallen 
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,i am enjoying your videos more than netflix
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,i like this car
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,i own an euro spec avenger the glovebox manual pouch issue is due to uk spec ones having the fuse box in the same place and stealing space the seat levers issue can be mitigated with the leather seats since those come with electric controls i dont share the gutless engine feel its more than enough in real lifeeven in the power limited normal mode
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,jeepers usually only acknowledge each other in wranglers in the states wranglers also have hidden animals on their vehicles its kind of cool
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,dont expect to get many if any rubber ducks or waves in this vehicle or most jeeps for that matter those are nearly always reserved for real jeeps the ones with straight axles 4wheel drive and removable roof and doors think willys models cjs djs wranglers and gladiators you dont see cherokees wagoneers compasses or renegades getting those and the avenger is even less jeeplike
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,looks a bit cheap and nasty to my eyes and i would expect something like this to cost in the 25k region not sure about avenger it looks a bit like an alegro from the front 
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,you lost me at all electric
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,dacia sandero is that you
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,are u on drugs
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,ive been watching some chinese eletric cars reviews byd and they seem to have more quality than this jeep specially on the interiormaybe this explains why they are trying to block them with more taxes
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,buy byd if available  but in china there are people saying it going on fire by itself
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,its an interesting car for surelooks familiar too d
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,335  _it offers enough room to store 2443 rubber ducks  well take their word for it_   im just imagining rory at the shop finding rubber ducks for sale and calculating on his phone how much it would cost to check jeeps claim and his eyes going wide  _well take their word for it_
2024-05-02,vqJX4FuVB2g,im not calculating a damn thing im getting 2500 ducks and putting an honest days work
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,i love your videos can i get a comment heart
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,jeep waves should be simply for wranglers only hello from across the pond in toledo ohio usa

2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,wasnt the avenger a shitty dodge model of yore
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,i wonder if theres a dopemineasmr effect for watching car review of cars you know you cant afford
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,does everyone use the same roads as harry garage and number27
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,awards bought buy the manufacturer
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,car of the year is meaningless award  every single magazine is giving out car of the year awards its a another bad stellantis product that you should stay away from
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,fiat car of the year yeah sure that only shows that these sources are as reliable as the plastic trashcans they are promoting
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,that vehicle is not being sold in the us because of the fact that real jeepers people that love their vehicles use them offroad out here in the west and rang anxiety is a major issue because of the lack of charging ports and even if they can find them they might not be able to be used due to the fact there not working also out here in the west we have tons of gas it might not be cheap because of the biden administrations lack of foresight but there is gas out here
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,im surprised they still sell jeep here no way theyre profitable
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,the brakes failed 4 times during the carwow review 
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,they failed oncethe fact they never abandoned the test and kept driving a dangerous car said more than enoughdid he really expect a brake malfunction to miraculously fix itself if kept driving 
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,alancobbin many die due to single failure  jeep has always been unreliable and unsafe atleast land rovers are safe for such high rates of breakdown any accident in jeep and youre dead 
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,thugputinim not disputing thati wouldnt keep a jeep if i was given one
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,carwow video has been taken down 
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,they deleted that video before i got to see it
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,alancobbinisnt this not a jeep at all  just a rebodied peugeot
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,the brakes didnt fail there was an error that showed up on the display four time
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,edithwhitebrownhall thats the kind of journalistic integrity only mat watson can provide
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,did carwow take down the video
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,thugputin anton yelchin was killed by a jeep cherokee  love his movie odd thomas and even thought im not a trekky the star trek movies were entertaining
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,joetz1  ah i live in rural usa and my first response was the jeep what
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,and has been removed since nowhere to find
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,joetz1 made by jeep and says jeep all over it its a jeep
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,abba_ra there was huge backlash on reddit and twitter because he still gave the car a shortlist despite clearly hating it throughout not having a single positive thing to say about the pos car and the fact it broke down 4 times almost like he was paid or something
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,"dreadpirateflappy its as much a jeep as a supra is a toyota 

he even said its a peugeot 2008 with jeep badges"
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,robertp457yeah but the title of the video made out they failed even though they didnt really fail at all click bait stuff
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,google carwow jeep avenger youtube review and all will be revealed
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,somewhat of an exaggeration  to say that the brakes actually failed
2023-09-22,vqJX4FuVB2g,according to google search it was taken down mere hours a only a few thousand views after upload
2023-09-24,vqJX4FuVB2g,how much did carwow get paid from jeep to take video down
2023-09-24,vqJX4FuVB2g,european car of the year cos it got xcamo rubber mats
2023-09-28,vqJX4FuVB2g,edithwhitebrownhall  drat should have watched it when i had the chance
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,thugputinjeep average is most likely a fiat  jeep aint american own anymore its italian 
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,epbrown01its an europe only model
2023-10-10,vqJX4FuVB2g,mrmannyhw 1223 essentially the same car as a peugeot e2008 or vauxhall mokka and the fiat 600e made in poland welcome to stellantis the fiat chrysler peugeot opel vauxhall jeep dodge ram combine
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,might as well go all the way and get a citroen ami  for 36k they can go  themselves
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,from what i saw on carwow its crap
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,of course not it was made car of the year before it was built
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,what a bs all magazines drove every car
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,"jjobar pre production press cars none on sale to customers so all the cars that came after for the majority of 2023 were not in the running no matter how much better they are and there are plenty of them
how on earth can a title be handed out at the beginning of the year"
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,its a no from mefor the same money id rather wait for the new ford explorer or spend a little more and get the new tesla model 3 
2023-09-21,vqJX4FuVB2g,i cant believe the price tesla is 34k gbp drive away equivalent down here in aus how can this be worth that much
2023-09-27,vqJX4FuVB2g,john_barnett in the uk the model 3 starts at 43k not 34k
2023-09-28,vqJX4FuVB2g,nickfoster exactly its not worth that much
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,john_barnettyou dont pay for patrol thats in itself pay for itself
2023-10-02,vqJX4FuVB2g,mrmannyhw what im comparing it with other evs the price of petrol doesnt come into it
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,its only for wranglers buddy sorry 
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,i thought willies were just the reals ones
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,nah pretty much any wrangler its a huge deal here in the us lots of people take the doors off and drive them around all summer lots of cheap open air fun for a family
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,a jeep thats not sold here in the states
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,you dont want it 
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,cos its as usually just another uglyfied fiat believe me its actually worse than actual jeeps
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,we do have it here in the states its called the jeep renegade just isnt electric
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,damienlee1165renegade is a completely different model
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,damienlee1165its not the same  renegade is kinda ugly and its expensive
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,mrmannyhw 100 agree but if they made the renegade electric it would fill the same niche essentially
2023-10-01,vqJX4FuVB2g,damienlee1165 so true
2023-10-12,vqJX4FuVB2g,damienlee1165 the platform on which the renegade and the 500x are made cannot accommodate batteries which is why this one was created
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,ive seen it irl the other day it looks like a weird cross between a panda and a jeep renegade so i guess this is the skeleton of the next panda
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,its just a rejigged  fiat 600e    exact same interior
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,only wranglers
2023-09-20,vqJX4FuVB2g,raise your hand if youve been watching autotrader for a long time

2024-03-02,5ykI_PwMrdg,bring it to the us  i would buy this little beauty in the metallic yellow in a heartbeat
2024-02-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,buy a kia sportage s line phev  same price better spec and you dont have the range anxiety of only doing a 100 mile trip and wondering if you will make it back it looks nice and thats about it
2024-02-11,5ykI_PwMrdg,front wheel drive only what a joke
2024-02-07,5ykI_PwMrdg,hybrid is only 74 kw 101 bhp what a joke for a jeep
2024-01-16,5ykI_PwMrdg,cracking looking small jeepbut at that price   no way 
2023-12-29,5ykI_PwMrdg,bro the price lol
2023-12-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,the poshest reviewer ever yah
2023-12-16,5ykI_PwMrdg,nyc car
2023-09-14,5ykI_PwMrdg,its not a jeep
2023-09-12,5ykI_PwMrdg,jeep  dodhe  stelantis sales are down because jeep has walked away from their traditional and formerly loyal customers while charging inflated prices for inferior products compass renegade hornet etc
2023-09-07,5ykI_PwMrdg,very good option for a longterm rental deal especially in europe
2023-09-07,5ykI_PwMrdg,012  wrong  the petrol versions have been available from day 1 and have outsold the ev by 86 to 13  what car motoring journalists could at least do a tiny bit of research  the petrol version is even coming here before xmas
2023-09-02,5ykI_PwMrdg,why so under powered
2023-08-13,5ykI_PwMrdg,i love it its really good
2023-07-19,5ykI_PwMrdg,"the shape of it looks just as boring as all the rest of its competitors in the marketplace

putting jeep on an ordinary looking boring car aint going to lift it out of the mundane"
2023-07-19,5ykI_PwMrdg,hang on a minute what do you mean the not very good renegade and before you all start with the its really a fiat 500 well it isnt nothing else lookss like one and nothing else punches above it weight off road like a limited or trailhawk so back off and leave the very very popular renegade alone
2023-07-16,5ykI_PwMrdg,far too expensive for a small suv and the depreciation after 23 years will be brutal
2023-07-13,5ykI_PwMrdg,soo they made a small renegade and made it electric  the renegade and compass are plug hybrids whats the point of this car 
2023-07-04,5ykI_PwMrdg,thats a fiat not a jeep a jeep has 4x4 low gears ladder frame chassis front and rear solid axels proper tyres sizes for offroad etc
2023-07-02,5ykI_PwMrdg,bring some competition to all the other evs in america
2023-07-02,5ykI_PwMrdg,come to america thats fucked up
2023-07-01,5ykI_PwMrdg,once i heard electric i bailed on the video
2023-09-07,5ykI_PwMrdg,coming to britain very soon as a petrol version
2023-06-29,5ykI_PwMrdg,nice little car  pity about the inability to convert it into a small camper  my current car is a renault zoe
2023-07-27,5ykI_PwMrdg,if you think as an upgrade you have better options because this looks smaller on inside even than ioniq 5 specially for space on rear seats so that say allot if you want decent room for 4 adults in the car and ioniq 5 can be spec with dualmotor like 4x4 awd and still have 340 miles of range between recharges if you plan going offroad just add some offroad wheels and raise the shocks a bit and ioniq will go in plenty offroads places that would put to shame plenty regular small offroad vehicles i have seen plenty owners doing offroad conversions to ioniq 5 a roofrack for extra gear and went offroading
2023-06-28,5ykI_PwMrdg,i must admit i personally like it  
2023-07-27,5ykI_PwMrdg,"but it looks smaller on inside even than ioniq 5  specially for space on rear seats 
and ioniq 5 can be spec with dualmotor like 4x4 awd and still have 340 miles of range between recharges"
2023-06-27,5ykI_PwMrdg,that power button sounds awful needing to live with that every time you get into the car and want to drive away sounds awful that really made me not wanting this car anymore 
2023-06-24,5ykI_PwMrdg,neat ev i guess but the best jeep ever was the wj
2023-06-20,5ykI_PwMrdg,way to go america sell out an american brand well hopefully they build it better than this country can
2023-06-17,5ykI_PwMrdg,sotiny cargood spec is nearly 40kno thanks overpriced
2023-06-03,5ykI_PwMrdg,enough with this electric nonsense lithium is a disgrace charging a car is a disgrace and batteries get bad quickly road handling is very bad due to inferior weight distribution compare to petrol cars many battery cars catch on fire so it is an hazard etcelectric will not last long it is only an excuse to make us all walk in 10 years or less wake up sheeples
2023-05-30,5ykI_PwMrdg,lol is that a fiat 
2023-05-16,5ykI_PwMrdg,very expensive for what it is
2023-05-15,5ykI_PwMrdg,"exactly like my ec4 stellantis is reshelling in the cheapest and easiest ways 
does it have battery heating my 2022 dont"
2023-06-24,5ykI_PwMrdg,the sound of the c4s indicators is way way better too
2023-05-15,5ykI_PwMrdg,wao what a beautiful car  how lucky and blessed are those who drive this
2023-05-09,5ykI_PwMrdg,thats just a dressed up jeep compass
2023-05-07,5ykI_PwMrdg,its chinese by the way  how much are they paying you i wonder
2023-05-06,5ykI_PwMrdg,so lots of neg comments i see whats better at this size minii3honda e have no range fiat 500 v small in back and feels cheap id3 even more expensive and rather large  for a 2nd car company car this looks good if the leases reasonable
2023-05-04,5ykI_PwMrdg,really appreciate the comparisons to the e2008
2023-05-04,5ykI_PwMrdg,french made renegades younger brother
2023-05-01,5ykI_PwMrdg,a jeep in name only
2023-04-27,5ykI_PwMrdg,really disappointed they arent bringing this to the us 
2023-12-28,5ykI_PwMrdg,the infotainment is junk tho
2023-04-26,5ykI_PwMrdg,thanks you made up my minda no i enjoyed the 2ltr renegade but this has nothing going for it
2023-04-25,5ykI_PwMrdg,where the heck are most of us supposed to find 35k for a very average small electric car by the way many of us do not want to use our phone for navigation and expect it built into the car if the volkswagen id2 really is going to be 22k i wouldnt go near this
2023-05-07,5ykI_PwMrdg,"i have nav built in the maps are over 6 years out of date and it costs 100 usd to buy the upgraded maps and i have to install them myself or i can use my phones native mapping software in this case google which not only keeps up with changes to roadways but also tells me when traffic is slow roads are temporarily closed and is able to route me different ways based on construction or current traffic patterns for the most time and fuel efficient ride 

so a 30 usd phone stand or 100 usd maps that will be out of date in a few years and cant tell me traffic patterns"
2023-04-25,5ykI_PwMrdg,jeep should sell this in the us
2023-04-25,5ykI_PwMrdg,would look good in white
2023-04-25,5ykI_PwMrdg,looking forward to this then he said fully electricand i switched off
2023-04-23,5ykI_PwMrdg,slow  heavy  expensive
2023-04-23,5ykI_PwMrdg,stupid car journalists moaning about a 208 sized car with ok rear leg room what do you think is going to be back there stop moaning you morons
2023-04-23,5ykI_PwMrdg,35000 for that hahaha
2023-04-23,5ykI_PwMrdg,"its a tall hatchback and i would buy one if they brought it to the us
but im told im slightly out of step with the average us buyer"
2023-04-30,5ykI_PwMrdg,i would also buy this if they brought it stateside we were looking to buy a bolt euv as a commuter i would take this jeep all day long over the bolt
2024-03-15,5ykI_PwMrdg,i really hate that theyre deciding what thr us does and doesnt get  i dont want a huge truck or jacked up wrangler  i own a 2003 tj wranger its small and super capable but if they sold it nowadays it would only be sold in europe  thats insane
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,this car is undoubtedly a waste of precious resources it should just be sold in asian markets i wish you didnt have to consume valuable time and effort as it iis clear that jeep doesnt care about what its name represent
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,it might be electric but sadly itll still be a jeep
2023-05-10,5ykI_PwMrdg,only the badge is jeep rest of is top quality fiat
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,whats the point in a jeep without 4wd
2023-05-10,5ykI_PwMrdg,"electric cars are for city ruining and a small car is necessary for running around in european cities which are thousands of years old with very narrow cobble stoned roads 
this car is ideal"
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,this car will only ever carry children in the back so the need to cater for six footers is irrelevant hard plastics are never mentioned when you review vw products but then thats whatcars vw bias on show
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,it aint a jeep without 4x4
2023-07-01,5ykI_PwMrdg,or a pos electric
2024-03-23,5ykI_PwMrdg,tamarafield5074 what do u mean foolish
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,the top of the range is nearly the same price as a base tesla  appalling value for money
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,i dont understand why car manufacturers still offer decals as a payable extra if i was to buy a jeep avenger with out the decals because i had to pay extra for them i would simply say thanks take the avenger and go to a shop that prints decals and give them a picture showing the decal on the car and get them to make the decals for me at a far better price
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,no sorry the best jeep was the first one from ww2  i have one
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,awful to drive though
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,gileshalliwell3591 haha by modern standards yes but i drove 700  miles to france and back in her last september and she never missed a beat just consumed super unleaded no ethanol at the rate of 18mpg great fun though cruises nicely at 4550mph  not bad for a 80 year oldatb pip
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,piprobinson6575 you got me there i have had similar fun in a 2cv
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,thats a lot of money for a pumped up supermini  if the car companies cant do any better on price with their evs theyll eventually all be chasing a shrinking customer base
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,i find beat sound very cool
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,i like it
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,basically the same car i have an e208 with a chunky body stellantis are really stretching out this platform seeing there will be nearly 10 different cars out based on the same thing will be expensive like the e208 though
2023-06-14,5ykI_PwMrdg,you mean 2008
2023-12-29,5ykI_PwMrdg,foxbow90 theyre the same lol
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,in july will be presentation of fiat 600 on this platform and maybe in september  an alfa romeo bsuv
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,so much plastic inside and out jeep is an american brand but this car will not be sold in america probably because if they did the internet would explode from the laughter
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,so beautiful what a piece of art astonished design
2023-04-25,5ykI_PwMrdg,are you being sarcastic i dont think you are 
2023-05-05,5ykI_PwMrdg,jukeboxjohnnie of course not this is so beautiful
2023-07-24,5ykI_PwMrdg,i agree it looks so cool its my favourite car
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,not everybody can have a plugin car because some live in flats
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,great review as always but i would add that as a father of an 11 year old the back seats look almost pointless being as my sons knees would not be at the edge of the seat so his legs would be more straight with his feet being like pushed against the back of the drivers seat not comfortable for him or myself youd think the manufacturers would give the space a bit more thought when aiming the vehicle at smaller families
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,wheres the written review exactly
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,hello  heres our written review httpswwwwhatcarcomjeepavengerhatchbackreviewn25706
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,not a suv with no 4x4
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,no 4x4  no jeep
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,i was thinking from the this might have been a ford mustang mach e real competitor seeing this review its not even close what a wasted opportunity
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,great looking car 999 of the time i dont drive offroad so who cares really about this not having 4x4 and if you do next year your wishes will be fulfilled
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,people buzzing on about reliability probably need to give electric cars a chance  most of the batteries seem to be similarly sourced and engineered  the software design and packaging are probably the biggest differences  and the charging
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,ill wait for the petrol version
2024-03-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,i bought petrol
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,if you chioldren are all 6 foot then they might not fit comfortably otherwise this is should not be a problem
2023-05-10,5ykI_PwMrdg,if you have big children  buy a big car  simple
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,i had a new grand cherokee overland in 2004what a carit went on the dunes and beach up to the ski resorts in france and towed a 35 ton boat and also one of the most comfortable cars ive ever hadthis is nothing like itwhat a let down
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,grand cherokee you are just missing the point but jeep will come with a grand cherokee e in the future or something similar
2023-04-24,5ykI_PwMrdg,isnt that like complaining that vw troc is nothing like vw touareg
2023-04-24,5ykI_PwMrdg,mirkozlikovski9553 its more about the fact that the jeep was always known as a great 4x4 go anywhere do anything carnow its not and thats a shame
2023-04-25,5ykI_PwMrdg,ianbrown1255 ok but porsche ferrari aston martin were always known as makers of great sports cars and now all have an suv models porsche even with diesel why would it now suddenly be a problem if jeep has a small trendy city  crossover
2023-04-25,5ykI_PwMrdg,mirkozlikovski9553 not a problem as long as they keep their heritage and keep building off road capable suvs for people like me
2023-04-25,5ykI_PwMrdg,ianbrown1255 hopefully they will at least in times of psa even up to acquisition of opelvauxhall and forming stand alone ds having common underpinnings did not mean rebadging but letting each of psa brands have its own character and design language and may be dual motor ev avenger version might get proper jeepworthy 4x4 capabilities
2023-10-03,5ykI_PwMrdg,this ejeep is as much a jeep as disneys star wars is star wars  not keep that junk away
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,a non 4x4 jeep  sounds more stupid when you say it out loud
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,overpriced by about 10000 imho
2023-09-16,5ykI_PwMrdg,15000
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,it seems it dilutes the jeep brand i cant see why its in the jeep stable they should have used one of the other brands
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,they already have the peugeot 2008 e opel mokka e citroen c3 on the same platform in the stellantis stable so what is the case
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,eh jeeps brand was diluted years and years ago by the grand cherokee not the later trailhawks and the mall cruisers of the like
2023-05-03,5ykI_PwMrdg,it is because jeep need a ev and needs it fast to be in compliance with both the us  eu mandate
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,il take byd atto 3 over this anyday quicker quirkier blade battery bigger v2l bigger infotainment screen roomier better build
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,better build it is chinese now i am being prejudiced
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,you can also take a tesla model 3 or y
2023-12-29,5ykI_PwMrdg,hoomeye its not their cheapest model so def better quality than even this probably this a styled 2008 which is more towards cheap plastics the plastics all come from china anyway lol
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,i think the byd atto3 has the avenger beaten for spec at similar prices uk models admittably the atto 3 has a bit of a mad interior but it has the larger  longer range  safer lfp battery heat pump  panoramic roof as standard in what is a slightly larger car with more interior  boot space that said i still find these ev cars far too expensive
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,more rubbish from jeep
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,so basically a french unreliable car that looks good
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,yep
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,if you look at the latest reliability charts the french cars are more reliable than the german products ie vw audi etc
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,its electric its not unreliable
2023-04-22,5ykI_PwMrdg,if youve ever even thought of going near a jeep you clearly dont care about reliability anyway
2023-07-11,5ykI_PwMrdg,french cars are reliable more so than american cars and german cars
2023-08-29,5ykI_PwMrdg,shroomyesc good point
2023-09-07,5ykI_PwMrdg," your living in the pastfrench cars are reliablemore than germando your research
instead of commenting on something you clearly know nothing about"
2023-11-18,5ykI_PwMrdg,why french
2023-04-21,5ykI_PwMrdg,magical video
2024-07-03,YxpaKrbA-b4,nz just dropped the price from 70k to 50k 34k to 24k it seemed to me at the time to be way over priced for what you got i guess the introduction of 8centkm road user charge for evs in april and other brands dropping prices hit them hard although 285 suggests they may have been gouging in the first place
2024-06-15,YxpaKrbA-b4,a beautiful car to drive and so comfortablethe miles is great and feels bigger than it is i would recommend this jeep to anyone
2024-06-10,YxpaKrbA-b4,anyone has alternative ev with pure ev structure that has yellow color in the interior like this
2024-05-18,YxpaKrbA-b4,bring it to india
2024-05-18,YxpaKrbA-b4,i hope this 12 engine is not stellantis puretech
2024-05-13,YxpaKrbA-b4,dont forget the unlegal state subsidies of chine evs sold in europe
2024-05-04,YxpaKrbA-b4,looks like bumblebee from transformers
2024-04-12,YxpaKrbA-b4,goin to view that tomorrow i will be driving that soon beautiful beast  motability car
2024-04-02,YxpaKrbA-b4,the price is crazy town no
2024-03-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,i collect mkne today i am excited 
2024-03-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,just get a e208 this is basically a expensive verison of e208
2024-03-05,YxpaKrbA-b4,stellantis the pokeman of the car industry  got to catch them all
2024-03-04,YxpaKrbA-b4,wouldnt mind this in the states as a renegade replacement
2024-03-03,YxpaKrbA-b4,muggles  hmmmm
2024-02-04,YxpaKrbA-b4,304   world car of the year  well  best family suv for women is a somewhat rarified category not world car of the year overall as that title went to the hyundai ioniq 6 together with world ev of the year
2024-01-28,YxpaKrbA-b4,its very good looking but 40k will buy you a 2022 ipace
2024-01-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,volvo ex30 left the chat
2024-01-22,YxpaKrbA-b4,either the host is a giant or this is a car for ants the fact its apeing the usual jeep design cues in this scale make it look even more conical
2024-01-12,YxpaKrbA-b4,im getting hint of 1st gen compass from this jeep
2024-01-09,YxpaKrbA-b4,take off your rings they are really distracting
2024-01-03,YxpaKrbA-b4,if it had been a 4xe hybrid and 4 wheel drive for 30k then it would be a winner  unfortunately its lacking
2023-12-30,YxpaKrbA-b4,"still dont understand why people are crazy about this car too small in the back to be a real family car incl boot space too expensive the greatest feature seems to be a shelve
why would you choose this jeep over lets say a niro ev"
2023-12-23,YxpaKrbA-b4,it is frickin brilliant in looks that is for certain  i will buy this vehicle in a heartbeat if it is available in hybrid form
2023-12-23,YxpaKrbA-b4,can someone please take one if these out for a test drive and return it filthy as sin im not interested in a jeep that doesnt go offroad and if no one will test that then why are they even making these reviews its a jeep not a mini cooper
2023-12-18,YxpaKrbA-b4,wait what forty grand cheque please
2023-11-30,YxpaKrbA-b4,"hi jack good review love jeep how tall are u as a driver 
im 64  finding suitable legroom in a car is alwayz an issue for me "
2023-11-29,YxpaKrbA-b4,this little vehicle would sell like hotcakes here in the united states but of course we only get overgrown overpriced evs
2023-11-27,YxpaKrbA-b4,this would be superhit in india when it launches
2023-11-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,looks like toy car in front of brother seriously why the want to downgrade there legacy
2023-11-23,YxpaKrbA-b4,jeeps always have nice little easter eggs its always nice letting the designers have fun with their work
2023-11-22,YxpaKrbA-b4,is the top of the battery case part of the rear passenger floor if so when the battery develops a fault will it vent gas in to the passenger compartment asking for a jeep 4xe owner
2023-11-19,YxpaKrbA-b4,guys you are being watched all over the world please put in also the metric system values when talking about distance range etc we the rest of the world would highly appreciate this thx
2023-11-16,YxpaKrbA-b4,"i had to lol at your this is getting serious now and then cuts to driving on a bit of field you could literally do that with a twingo mate 
anyhow as a jeep wrangler owner in europe and a long time jeep buyer i can tell you one thing is certain you are an idiot if you buy a jeep in europe 
the dealer network is among the worst in the industry and they will try everything not fix your jeep under warranty there are so many forums packed with such complaints and indeed it fits my own experience 
do not buy a jeep in europe unless of course you enjoy paying for constant repairs on your own"
2023-11-12,YxpaKrbA-b4,augmented reality seat belts lol
2023-11-10,YxpaKrbA-b4,german drivers may be confused by a regen buttondisplay because the german word regen means rain 
2023-11-10,YxpaKrbA-b4,people of my age remember the time when every car had unpainted bumpers 
2023-11-09,YxpaKrbA-b4,buttons beat screens 
2023-11-08,YxpaKrbA-b4,i need a liberty sized jeep  this is to small  i cant carry the stuff i need
2023-11-07,YxpaKrbA-b4,having underfloor storage for cables is a stupid idea if you want to carry any luggage especially if the boot is big who wants to have to unload the boot to dig out the cables for recharging would you be thanking the manufacturer if it happened to be a wet or very cold day or would you be more likely to be describing the manufacturer in anglo saxon terms
2023-11-07,YxpaKrbA-b4,im a jeep fan and this one looks fantastic a sleek and elegant design as always for jeep cars ev makes it a bit more ecofriendly and riderfriendly
2023-11-06,YxpaKrbA-b4,jack  your enthusiasm for giving a vehicle a fair shake is a joy no the car for me  but i can think of a few people this would fit well
2023-11-04,YxpaKrbA-b4,"car
prices are plummeting they will have to
reduce massively to selll here people
are stifling with their bills at it is"
2023-11-04,YxpaKrbA-b4,another fiat with a jeep badge 
2023-11-02,YxpaKrbA-b4,as much as you can make it look good in our eyes which is your job  but it doesnt justify the 40k price tag  its shit i do remember that i commented on your revel of this car in january i said you are laying about the back seat space which you said its great  unfortunately now you confirm that you was selling a product for companies not us as consumers
2023-11-01,YxpaKrbA-b4,seeing jack stand next this out in the field is borderline ridiculous  this is a tiny car but i suspect that is their intention
2023-11-01,YxpaKrbA-b4,40 k is a ridiculous price
2023-11-01,YxpaKrbA-b4,cannot understand his talk  on the front plastic cladding stopping damage when the cladding is actually set vack from the painted bodywork
2023-11-01,YxpaKrbA-b4,if everyone is so crazy about them how come no one is buying them
2023-11-01,YxpaKrbA-b4,not going for this
2023-11-01,YxpaKrbA-b4,it is too much pricey
2023-10-31,YxpaKrbA-b4,i really like the avenger but not for tesla model 3 money
2023-10-31,YxpaKrbA-b4,forty grand i wouldnt pay that for tardis
2023-10-31,YxpaKrbA-b4,breaking news gm have stopped production of evs for good they are stuck with 214000 unsold evs  next friday toyota  fiat  ford  mg  are all having a meeting on stopping production of evs  evs are the biggest motor car disaster to hit the industry ever only tesla are doing well but not brilliantly as it stands today across the ev car industry 22 million evs are parked up on closed airports dock yards and storage facilities within america and the european union its over for evs   rip  and thank goodness
2023-10-30,YxpaKrbA-b4,ec3 instead  same group but almost 12 the price
2023-10-30,YxpaKrbA-b4,the reason theres no room in back is because they took a regular gas car  and put an electric motor in it therefore it will fail  as it will be unprofitable to build at a competitive price what a waste of time 
2023-10-29,YxpaKrbA-b4,in the states a new tesla model 3 can be had for about 30k with incentives and has much better range  also has access to tesla chargers
2023-10-29,YxpaKrbA-b4,car insurance for ev 2023 deliberately uk the cartel acting to prohibit access to ev  100 hikes for tesla y claimed to be a supercar  bullshit
2023-10-29,YxpaKrbA-b4,looks great but its 40k so i will stick with the golf blumotion until i can afford an ev if i ever can
2023-10-29,YxpaKrbA-b4,"plus points 1 rear charging port 2 a sensible sized less intrusive screen 3 real buttons 4 great range 5 nonclaustrophobic front seat environment
bad point i agree with jack one pedal regen driving is now a must for me
i have a new measure for driving acceptability how quickly can i turn off the dangerous lane assist madness after putting the key in my eup has a dedicated laoff button in reach from the steering wheel so this jeep will be slower than that but much better than those cars that bury it down two levels of the incar screen menu"
2023-10-29,YxpaKrbA-b4,it looks like citreon c3 from back and side
2023-10-29,YxpaKrbA-b4,they should have done the interior like the vauxhall mokka black roof much better it seems a lot more comfortable
2023-10-29,YxpaKrbA-b4,please put in the charger for electric around birmingham northfield
2023-10-29,YxpaKrbA-b4,this is the vauxhall mokka equivalent motor is beautiful electric
2023-10-28,YxpaKrbA-b4,bring this to the us jeep
2023-10-28,YxpaKrbA-b4,crazy is the word i would use to describe anyone foolish enough to buy a jeep then i saw the price next
2023-10-28,YxpaKrbA-b4,suvs only need to be able to get through snow in areas so blessed we have been forced into vehicles we really dont need bring back decent sedans and theyll likely sell  just like they used to mini wagons need to make a resurgence for those needing to haul stuff
2023-10-28,YxpaKrbA-b4,good styling job on the interior and exterior of that  looks excellent shame about the price
2023-10-28,YxpaKrbA-b4,making fun of safety thats just brilliant 
2023-10-28,YxpaKrbA-b4,40k best car of the year 
2023-10-27,YxpaKrbA-b4,nice review and a very cool design at first glance it looks like better looking version of the fullsize jeep wagoneer but then when jack steps in front of it 410 his height combined with the wideangle lens view makes the car look tiny  like a little childs pedal car
2023-10-27,YxpaKrbA-b4,"i ordered my jeep avenger 28th of february 2023 i am still waiting
so i console myself watching these reviews glad to see that i made a right choice bit sad that i cant experience it yet but hey patience is a virtue
anyhow thanks for this review jack"
2023-10-27,YxpaKrbA-b4,its the same price as a tesla model 3 ffs 
2023-10-27,YxpaKrbA-b4,this would have been better as a dodge jeep has a legacy and image if it cant go off road or at least look like it can it wouldnt sell in the us
2023-10-27,YxpaKrbA-b4,so its a bit like the dacia sandero of stellantis  simple efficient car for most people
2023-12-18,YxpaKrbA-b4,more like the dacia spring  and you can get two of them for the price of this
2023-10-27,YxpaKrbA-b4,a car without four wheel drive should not wear the jeep badge 
2023-10-27,YxpaKrbA-b4,are all these cars jacks presenting realy realy small or is jack really really these cars arent small at all are they
2023-10-27,YxpaKrbA-b4,actually you dont need 1 pedal driving i usually turn off regen and just coast along  and when i need regen i use brake pedal the way tesla cars are tuned for 1 pedal driving simulates the experience of driving a gas powered car it helps when youre coming from gas to evs but in reality evs dont need that its far more efficient to accelerate coast  use regen by pressing brake rather than 1 pedal where i have to hold the pedal just at the right angle to coast
2023-10-27,YxpaKrbA-b4,i want augmented reality seatbelts 
2023-10-27,YxpaKrbA-b4,lol why do you guys say per sho pee cho
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,how is this significantly better than the chevy bolt which came out in 2017 it is cheaper too
2023-10-30,YxpaKrbA-b4,not saying its better but the bolt is not widely available in europe
2023-10-30,YxpaKrbA-b4,dcvariousvids8082 i was looking at it from jeep being a us brand and competing with gm in the us i was just pointing out the hype that might be tempered some i own a 2023 bolt and it is a great car and looking forward to the refresh
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,your days are numbered 
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,reworked ice car evs are really not where the industry is at  and please making a virtue of cheap plastic cladding is ott  unfortunately this is just another european ev on the margins pumped up by motoring journalists and ev zealots  it probably works well in an urban environment but away from that field it will be pretty naff
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,in china theres slave labour would you like that in the eu dont think soso dont compare themplus most car companies in china are subsidized by the government who cheats
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,curious to see your opinion comparing this to the volvo ex30
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,maserati too dumbarse  best auto manufacturer in the world
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,expensive junk
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,great review especially liked the vw reference i do believe you are borderline sane on a good dayeh
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,oh how i understand you for that line assist thing it is absolutely useless and annoying
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,has this fella never heard of a glovebox
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,"not every stellantis lack of one pedal driving the 500e has a range mode which is basically one pedal driving

and btw one pedal driving is indeed a must not a pedantic complaint"
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,this costs exactly like the fiat 500x now called fiat 600electric and this is the same car underneath car manufacturers think we are a bunch of imbeciles
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,you pronounce peugeot so badly that the subtitles cant get what word you are saying while they get volkswagen out of a cough
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,this channel is like an ev cult all it talks about are the good things about ev im an ev owner and would like some balanced reviews thousands of ev are catching fire in china but all the reviews of chinese car are positive 40 chinese ev car companies have gone bust but no mention of this at all
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,is he 3m tall  the car looks so small
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,this looks like it could be a home run for jeep if this and the 600e are what stellantis are creating now the future for all the brands concerned looks very good
2023-11-22,YxpaKrbA-b4,reliability is key its also relative to other vehicles in the segment right now its not good certainly not good enough at this price point finally where i live stellantis have a habit of not honouring their warranty being taken to court for it losingbeing fined by the regulator dragging their feet on providing remedies to the plaintiff and then telling everyone they are misunderstood its the way people drive their cars not the failed product
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,as an american this car is embarrassing obviously its popularity has a lot to do with the usa associated jeep brand they are buying a dream and it will lead to disappointment as it does not live up to the brand there is a real jeep 4xe plug in hybrid that is sometimes electric and a real jeep the car featured here could not be sold in the states due to its lack of capability hopefully you guys will be getting plenty of real ford broncos to feed that americana off road appetite
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,the lack of one pedal driving is a serious defect to me as a long time ev driver who rather likes regen  it might have just been the camera mount but the car seemed loud and rattly
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,save you some time better to buy an mg electric for cheaper with more space  shame jack didnt just start with that
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,not everyone wants a car that has been manufactured in a ccpowned factory
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,"really enjoy all your videos can i make a tiny request it would really help if at the start of your car reviews you tell us quite plainly and promptly 
1 the mkwh 
2 the range and 
3 the price 

this video for example waits to be half way through to casually mention the vehicle is a 40 grand car
im sure i dont speak for a small percentage of your audience when i say these are the most important factors that all else hang on we may well still watch the video who knows we might win the lotto and now all the other stuff is relevant  but id rather know up front that everything you are about to hear only exists in fantasy land because you cant afford it  rather than entertain the idea that the car is attainable only to be shattered after watching or half watching the video 

and as a post script  you get three quarters of the way through to find out its an electric build over an ice car so there is less space  for those of us really looking to try our best to get into electric car ownership we need a slimmed down version of these kinds of reviews so we can save time having watched this video i now know i would never buy this car even if i had the money so in that sense it has served its purpose but i think if id had the relevant info right at the start i could have come to that conclusion within 1 minute instead of 19"
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,"as for jack hes the best 
as for this jeep too many better alternatives at this price next "
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,another great ev that is not going to be available in the us 
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,this reviewer is really living life curtains and an umbro shirt hes cool hes trendy
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,more expensive than a niro why would you not buy a niro  you would right its miles better crap
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,yes and the niro ev is a very low bar to compare to its an old model and not even based on an ev platform
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,one pedal driving is essential are you listening car manufacturers essential
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,"i honestly dont get it it is rubbish compared to an id3 mg 4 or byd dolphin
it is like a fiat 500  it is a 2 person car  not a family car"
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,tempted  until i heard the price interesting and loads of great lines as always
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,volkswagongesundheit jack
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,the interior is a bit too utilitarian for me and i dont want to see body colour inside thanks
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,where is the jeep recon
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,no way this can compete with the volvo ex30
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,my fiat panda had a fullwidth shelf 30 years ago
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,never ever ever buy a jeep they literally have the worst customer satisfaction in the world they are unreliable  if you get a lemon even in the unlikely event that the dealer wants to do the right thing corporate jeep definitely wont avoid this company at all costs
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,its not a jeep thats just the badge
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,jamespaul2587 its stil stellantis  thats the problem
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,"i have to agree that it is a stand out car it caught my eye as soon as i saw it and i am neither a jeep fan nor an suv fan it is just a characterful and practical car
i agree also with the notion that some car features dont get properly scrutinised before going into production cars have been around long enough to get the basics right and even though new features pop up from time to time  cup holders for example  surely there is no need to reinvent anything just for the sake of it
ive just started a list of things that i like but arent yet universal even though it is a no brainer to have them the drive selector should be as found in the bmw i3 and now in vw ids too no arguments that is just how it should be sunglasses holder still not universal and yet so useful a glove box that you might be able to fit more than a pair of gloves in at least it should have some room left after putting the handbook in there a spare wheel or a space saver at the minimum this should be top of the list dont know why i left it so long front storage even a front wheel drive multi platform car like this should be able to find room for charging cables but more room would be appreciated for emergency items andor muddy boots rear wheel drive not only does it make for a better balanced drive with no real downsides i got through many severe winters with rwd just put a bag of sand in the boot it puts a bit more weight over the drive wheels and could be good for sprinkling on the road too the upsides are many the driving feel and balance already mentioned bigger front storage tighter turning circle less spinning of the front wheels especially in evs and therefore quicker and safer getaways i love the driver display in the vw id3 that moves with the steering wheel  genius real buttons and knobs i know that teslas system works well but that is the exception that proves the rule if your not 110 confident that your software is well designed and responds instantly dont risk ruining your car just fit real buttons and not haptic ones either finally put efficiency higher on the list of development goals too many manufacturers make their cars only as aerodynamic or light as they feel they can get away with it is such a desirable quality to have an efficient car its a marketable feature"
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,just putting it out there fully charged is getting very slow to review new evs i see cars on other youtube channels  weeks sometimes months earlier please understand the channel is great as is content maybe a quick ev news weekly could fill in some of the gaps
2023-11-22,YxpaKrbA-b4,top gear for cars with plugs
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,forty grand not a chance
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,no matter how good this car is and no matter what people thinks about elon you surely cant recommend this over an updated model 3 at a pound under 40k
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,nice and somehow efficient but still not a proper ev
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,thank you jack for your great reviews the big feature lacking on all the smaller cheaper evs is the total absence of ability to put a towbar on we have to keep a petrol car until we can have an ev with towbar can you comment on that in all your reviews please
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,as the world is moving towards car sharing and use of cars when needed and not owning poor back seat space is a major downfall this is essentially a 2 seater
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,a toy in comparison to the munro
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,uk to eu translation service 5 mikwh is about 125 kwh100km
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,not for me
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,why dont they sell the avenger in the us
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,40k ouch just not sure how that could compete with  model 3 for the same price
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,some people just dont want a made in china tesla
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,looks exactly like mokka e with somewhat different front end
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,preach i feel like the user interface on most cars was designed and tested by the same people who decided what it should d so they think its brilliant but most people coming to it with fresh eyes find it unintuitive and often actively a pain to use
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,"1731 35k to 40k for a small evand jack goes on to say how stellantis are breaking their back to get their prices as low as possible 
if i can get a model 3 for 40k this jeep doesnt stand a chance"
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,that thing is tiny not for north america as for the shelf well its just junky however it would be a good idea if there was  a cover for it in my ideal interior all bins need to have a cover it just looks neater and with my ocd i cant tolerate things that arent
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,i really like that yellow its what i wish the ex30 had instead of the pallid moss yellow
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,it needs to be 12k cheaper to sell in quantity
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,such a sad indictment of the current state of the car industry when the highest praise you can heap on to a fourty grand plasticity shopping car is that it has a shelf and doesnt beep at you
2023-12-18,YxpaKrbA-b4,indeed the cheapest nastiest 1 series petrol 16 manual beemer with no options and 16 inch wheels is 29k insane
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,ooh hark at jack in his percival polo the channel must be doing alright financially
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,anyone know what he said during that cough all i can hear is hurl dragon
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,please stop conflating one pedal drivingadjustable regen with the existence of regen braking guess what happens when you use light to moderate braking on this jeep thats right regen braking
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,love how in the us we have a daring journalist drive up a steep almost vertical rock wall outside of moab ut and in the uk its white knuckling it through an almost level grass field
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,stellantis cant make reliable cars stopped watching
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,wont sell in merica
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,or anywhere else at that price
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,a sissys car
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,we need a jack long term impressions of the old polestar 2 having lived with it for a couple of years now
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,40000 crazy
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,cmon jack youre trying way too hard to praise anything electric even this overpriced nonsense its so great at being a car really  a cheap open shelf to throw clutter everywhere as you round a sharp turn isnt a great feature even if it does hold your kids inevitable vomit
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,entertaining video for sure if you consider everything you should while buying an ev this is not it 
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,totally agree with your ncap comments
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,"40000  
stellantis shouldrethink and look at the fact that theres millions of fiats opels citroëns ad peugeots that are fit to be refurbished and retrofitted into evs"
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,"an oversized and overweight car praised and claimed to be small and tiny and it having far more ground clearance than necessary with all of the problems that involves incl contributing to weightsize and lessening practicality is presented as good wtf
and raving about how much luggage space it has for its size despite crossovers having _way less space_ than noncrossovers of the same size
its not crossoveriness just for the sake of crossovers
there is no such thing there is nothing about crossovers that has any practicalfunctional benefit ever no protecting the paintwork has nothing to do with being a crossover"
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,a small family car for 40k what kind of family can afford that
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,it isnt small in any way either
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,maybe reviewers think its small compared with some of the giant suvcrossoverwhatever they call them
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,"1620 i endorse this rant¹ 

¹about euro ncap  socalled lane assist"
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,small are you blind it is not small and _all crossovers are oversized overweight have way more ground clearance than necessary_ the ground clearance makes getting in and out a bit more difficult and is one thing of many that contributed to crossovers being heavier bigger and significantly more dangerous
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,you like the tray  to me the tray is a mess with your clutter on it and will allow stuff to slide around and be really irritating while driving
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,how does this compare to the newly announced citroen ec3 that is about 23 000euros and appears to have similar specs
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,no surprise it was a gushing review  stellantis dont like any negative comments wouldnt touch any stellantis product with a 10 foot pole
2023-10-31,YxpaKrbA-b4,a 10 foot pole would really make this car look small
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,way too expensive for what it is everyone will just get a tesla for that money
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,a none starter as far as im concerned ridiculously expensive no bespoke ev architecture no one pedal driving in a city car all bonkers who gave it all the awards
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,this is the styling to replace the north american jeep cherokee if it is up sized by 50 to the size of a wrangler platform or the current cherokee as a phev or bev
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,ha next to jack it looks tiny
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,"the car that broke broke down 4 times during the carwow review that mat clearly hated as he said it felt cheap and shit on it the entire video then they still gave it a shortlist and had to remove the video due to the controversy

something fishy about this cheap shitty car that everyone seems to rave about almost like stellantis are giving back handers"
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,why did carwow delete the video
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,nobody is crazy about us european and japanese legacy auto trash
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,another ugly expensive piece of plastic that will rust just as fast for people that refuse to use a bike or public transport in a city
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,40k for a small car inflation is painfully obvious
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,however you may wish to dress it up this car is overpriced for what it is especially as the new citroen which i am guessing is the same platform looks like it will be substantially cheaper  so even within the stellantis group this car looks overpriced 
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,looks like the dacia spring  built in china by dongfeng 
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,augmented reality seatbelts 
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,but what is your height
2023-10-31,YxpaKrbA-b4,3 foot 7
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,you can buy a refresh tesla model 3 for 40k and fit a jack in the rear without breaking him
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,why would you get this over a tesla i know where id put my 40k
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,so totally inferior to the mg4
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,lets shop around hyundai kona electric from 35k renault zoe from 30k citroen ec3 will be under 25k jeep are trading on the name
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,did i miss the bit where we found out about range and charging speeds still a good review and enjoyable to watch but these kinds of things are key to a purchasing decision
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,220230miles on a 50kwh battery
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,timpayne7676 what about charging speed
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,grille and huge useless bonnet nope
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,but did you like it
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,i wonder how many times did it break down while shooting this video i have seen many reviews carwow uk its kinda feature in jeep to break down
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,why did carwow delete their video
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,its a jeep what do you expect even there reviews break down ha 
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,agmhd avenger doesnt share a single part with any other jeep model its a peugeot underneath carwow part owned by volvo deleted the video because something was clearly wrong with the information they presented in the video their latest honda crv video made it look like the electric windows are unsafe even though theyre not and had to issue a statement
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,no likely
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,its a peugeot 
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,to all eoems yes i want to buy a almost new ev driving bev 2012 and phev 2015 the stellantis cars with 10kwh100km makes a really good chancebut i will not buy anything untill you deliver a real v2h or v2l car  if you calculate the the costs of ownership this will make out 30 of the purchase
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,is it a fiat 600 rebadged
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,theyre all based on the peugeot 2008 and e2008
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,i had no idea jeep was popular in italy hmm
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,220 miles from a 50kwh battery is efficient
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,103 the front door doesnt line up properly sorry but couldnt watch after that as someone who has numerous neurodivergencies that was a nogo thats the only thing i could think of once i saw it
2023-10-31,YxpaKrbA-b4,i used to be neuroactively challenged  before doc revivified me
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,the experiences ive had with jeeps are not great it generally revolves around build quality and it seems not much has changed with the nasty packaging quality plastics in this one and has anyone mentioned the price  like gees louise put that next to byd atto 3 and the question is why would you bother
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,well look here 1958 morris mini shelf reinvented practical and exciting 65 years later well done the auto industry
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,most of the world does not use miles per kwh can we please have efficiency reported in units we understand
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,sure wish stellantis would bring the avenger to north america  id trade them for a whole shipload of crappy italian made jeep renegades  theyre just sitting on lots here unsold anyway  id trade in my ram 1500 with a 57l hemi v8 for a avenger
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,interesting to see the jeep name on what is essentially a french car
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,or a volvo name on a chinese built car
2023-10-31,YxpaKrbA-b4,jzheepuh maudit anglais
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,what are you talking about nobody is crazy about the jeep avenger
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,you are dead right about the price being the serious problem with this car at a sensible price the stellantis products would be decent evs for many people but who in their right mind would choose them over far higher spec and higher tech offerings from tesla and the chinese brands for the same price i am convinced stellantis is happy to keep their ev sales to a minimum and slow down the transition away from ice vehicles for as long as possible
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,stellantis look to be making excellent secondhand evs by which i mean youll be able to pick up a pretty decent ev for peanuts second hand given their apparent depreciation
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,"love your offroad work jack just like the telegraph track on cape york
but i want more car than that for my money it cost 2 mg4s"
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,this is not a jeep
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,perhaps one of the thing that makes chinese electrics are cheaper is that they simply use simple mechanics case in point the wuling air ev drivetrain instead of fancy motor unit with transaxle the air ev just stuck an electric motor on a rear axle combined with the cheaper lithium iron phosphate they can deliver a truly affordable entry level electric car
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,it is also cheaper because it hasnt been manufactured to european standards
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,"this thing is more expensive than a model 3 and chevy bolt and is a worse car than both of them  

at best its a 22k value car"
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,whatchu talking bout willis its pronounced willys think pee pee
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,perhaps we should have a comprehensive enquiry into the luton multi story carpark collapse before advocating for the mass adoption of evs
2023-10-31,YxpaKrbA-b4,"its england inquiry will
be completed by lady cressida dick in 2038"
2023-11-02,YxpaKrbA-b4,"my first car was a 16 opel vectra weighed just about a tonne if memory serves 
every car since has gotten heavier im up 800 kg now in an insignia
still just a diesel

then theres the rich cunts in range rovers and gwagons weighing 25 tonnes

you dont like evs and for some reason are on an ev only channel but theyre not solely responsible for the problems of the world"
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,stellantis is not bringing this jeep to the usa sadly as it would be an excellent replacement for my wifes jeep liberty which is now approaching 20 years old and never had to be taken to a dealer  but at that price it would be too expensive anyway  at 30k it would sell  at 40k it wont  and the small ev they are proposing to eventually bring here nooks like crap  so gbye jeep
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,anyone else noticed the carwow review of this particular car has completely vanished of youtube it was given a bit of a slating as it had few mechanicalelectrical issues but carwow should have the courage of its convictions and keep the review up
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,agreed but concerns should be directed to carwow
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,wolves colours the only plus 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,the styling is genius i didnt realize how small it is until he is standing next to it being 6 4 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,so you want to cram all your stuff on a shelf whats wrong with the glove box
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,miles
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,honestly disappointed in this review in so many ways this car shows lack of competition short range cheap materials fake jeep expensive and a unreliable platform and yet he keeps talking about the weirdest stuff that has barely anything to do with longevity and usefulness this review honestly sounds like stellantis quick sheet wrapped in clickbait nobody is crazy for this car besides a small few at most
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,100 agree with your lane assist rant i drive a 2009 mini cooper which i hope to replace soon with an electric car but im dreading the enforced tyranny of the lane assist system surely euro ncap should rethink its stance when most drivers turn it off every time they get in their car
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,yus  its another safety feature that works in the labs and gets cars a good active safety score but doesnt work on the road
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,i have a jeep renegade limited and i can switch off  lane assist traction control and blindspot warning  and the renegade is the only car that has not anything repaired or replaced in five years
2023-10-28,YxpaKrbA-b4,there are evs out there with excellent lane assist systems i never turn off mine
2023-12-15,YxpaKrbA-b4,i have a renegade  i can switch of most driver assist functions if i dont t need it i particularly love the lane assist function  its a life saver if the driver falls asleep on the motorway expressway the car immediately  corrects the direction and gives a vibrations through the steering wheel
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,crazy is a good choice of words
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,hey jack thanks for this honest review i just wanted to mention 2 things 1 the mg 4 is about 5 inches bigger going to the rear space and 2 the fully charged show has not yet mentioned the new citroen ëc3 another step in the right direction for stellantis new platform new 83 kw motor new 44 kwh lfp battery for under 23000 i hope youll have a presentation of that car soon 
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,this isnt an honest review its an ad to recover from the clusterfuck the jeep avenger carwow video was a few weeks ago that was pulled as the car kept breaking down dont believe this review jeep cant even provide owners parts for existing ice vehicles highly questionable video
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,whiteevo6 well its not an ice car so no problem with existing ice parts and carwow must have had a car that was not ready to be driven just bad luck all the others have also appreciated the avenger if you dont like it so be it but he was honest in his review thats for sure
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,ec3 video coming tomorrow matey pretty mindblowing thing  10k cheaper than its stellantis siblings stay tuned
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,jackscarlett1 great looking forward to it 
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,indeed bigger car is bigger in shock result
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,great video but mile dosnt tell the rest the world nothing  why not put km on the screen will be great help thanks 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,the original jeep was designed for import into european and asian cities whether they liked it or not
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"im looking to change my renault captur  go ev in the next few months  so far this is top of my list as gone are my days of needing a big family car 
i like jacks reviews as im a tall bugger like him so i get a real life idea of interior size  headroom"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,they really dont want to sell these cars do they the cost is ridiculous
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,oh common man this thing starts at 39500 in holland for a small b segment crossover with only 400 km wltp the citroën ëc3 is a way better deal for a car that size
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,cant wait to see your review of the very latest tesla model 3 highland in declutterred state
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,mine is on order just waiting for it to get built hurry up
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,when you said 40000 i stopped watching
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,tupperware got so expensive
2023-10-31,YxpaKrbA-b4,lids are flimsy
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"why dont you ask jeep about the carwow video they had taken down as this car kept breaking down 

as a jeep grand cherokee owner of a 2014 model that needs so much repair its repair costs are more than its second hand value and jeep refuse to admit the cars a lemon id suggest you buy anything other than an jeep regardless of cost the taking down of the video shows they are dishonest

i find it a little concerning you also say the car is being raved about without mentioning the taking down of the carwow video as it was such a huge news ive had a part on order that starts the car so semi critical for 3 years and they cant obtain it good luck buying this car "
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,you could buy a tesla model 3 for the same money and have access to the supercharger network if legacy auto makers cant produce evs at prices people can afford they wont last much longer
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"i think for that price it should be able to go around 300 miles
in my opinion the electric car will only fully beat the petrol and diesel cars when the range matches theirs still electric cars are already really great we dont need to discuss that
also how in the world can you only put one usb c port in the back in a 40k car "
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,it does look like the perfect vehicle for a child to throw up in
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,lane assist is a death trap

2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"with jack stood next to it this new jeep pretty much looks like a microcar

maybe dont let tall people do adverts or reviiews"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,easily the most praise a jeep has gotten in a long time  they are more famous in na for being unreliable selling exclusively to men desperate to proejct a certain image
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,you lost me with the hybrid design
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,imight be in ilust the jeep isnt bad either  
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,just seen lots of these jeep avengers 8n spain all petrol powered not a single ev
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,jeep was only going to sell it in the uk as an ev but has given in to pressure petrolpowered one will be along soon
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,bw1376 we that will be great news but citroen new c3 8s basically the same car si there could be some rivalry between these two as the are both aiming at the young and trendy market
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,keithnewton8981 not convinced people will warm to the styling of the new citroen it looks like theyre taking the brand down market to compete with dacia
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,is this 10k better than the mg4 ev i speccd one on the jeep uk site for 39k vs 29k for the mg4 long rangeor the smart which costs the sameplus mg4 holds its value quiet wellthat final verdict had absolutely 0 rationality as if you are buying a rembrandt
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,id much rather spend more on something that wasnt made in a ccpowned factory
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,thanks jack 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i just love the playfulness of the intererior with that coloured bar across the dashboard in the same colour as the exterior similar to what you see in the fiat 500 etc
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i totally get the fcss enthusiasm but calling massively overpriced cars reasonably priced is a crime considering all the energy prices going up its just false economy and btw i drive an ev myself and im struggling to convince the people around me any more
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,gesundheit 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,45 degrees is a serious incline hey
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,when i saw your headline it was time to switch off it broke down four times with matt watson
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,why did carwow delete the video
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,bw1376 did not know that obviously jeep were not happy with the review
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,scottishnsrailfan honda doesnt appear to be too happy with the latest crv review either i wonder if it has anything to do with carwow now being partowned by volvo who itself is owned by geely
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,bw1376 as the actor said on rowan and martins laugh in very interesting
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"why is it when jack does the rear seat leg room he shows his seat so far back in the next shot hes driving and theres no way that seats in the same position 
in the rear shot he is sat behind the b pillar 
theres making a point and theres being creative with the truth"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,horrible bloviatiing review with all the key technical data missing
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,too small someone please make an estate car to rival the mg
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,it isnt small in any way shape or form unless your talking luggage space  that is on that count all crossovers are small
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,zarlanthegreen  hence the request for someone to make estate cars
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"to answer the thumbnail no no it isnt especially at that price 

peugeots in disguise

excellent report as ever though"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,yeah jeep  rubbish reliability over expensivne parts even for a car maker throw you under the bus if a warranty claim is made  oh yes i really want one of those
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,and the big elephant in the room not addressed bjorn nyland showing 143 miles of range at 120 kmhr in summer testing  which will be 100120 in winter  completely unacceptable for a 40000 car when a model 3 sr will give you better range and better charging for similar price
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,again comments about italian and italian drivers it sounds like you suffered of a trauma did you girlfriend left you for an italian find a good psychologist mate
2023-10-31,YxpaKrbA-b4,my revivifier doc is a terrific psychologist  i used to be neuroactively challenged but i got better
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,the fiat 600e comes with lfp batteri from byd just until stellantis gets their factory up and running but is it with jeep avenger too
2023-10-30,YxpaKrbA-b4,"the avenger has a nmc pack
lithiumnickel manganese cobalt linimco less weight  more energydense than lfp thermal runway at 220c10444f good for long lifecycle and high loading

whereas an lfp pack
lithium ironphosphate_ lifepo4 heavier than nmc but less energydense equalling less potential range especially in cold than packs with cobalt and due to less valued chemistry lfp packs are potentually less likely to be recycled thermal runway at 270c518f good for durability 2000 80 discharge cycles"
2023-10-30,YxpaKrbA-b4,dcvariousvids8082 i would still rather have lfp batteries they are only about 100 kg heavier and can still be charged as quickly as most nmc batteries so they have twice as long a lifetime
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,jack would you buy this right away or have to wait to try the volvo ex30
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,bruh thats a fiat
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,thx jack good to know its not an opelvauxhall problem with the lane keep assist its a stellantis problem or a general problem funny thing is every car has different problems with lka while our mokka e tries to murder us on streets without road boundary marks the mg4 wants to murder me if there are too many lines like in highway construction sites so first thing my wife and i do after starting the car deactivate that piece of  murdertech  sidenote thats a point for vauxhallopel because i can deactivate it with a button yes praise them for the button after curse them for the feature
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i think you should always start with the price so for those of us who are not able to even consider the expensive vehicles we can decide right away whether its worth watching
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,youre right of course but doing that would immediately slash their viewing figures in half quentin wilson admitted ev prices were a major issue but they still like to ignore the issue in their reviews
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,i hope you skip all podcast about cars over 20000 maybe bike show is something for you
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,msjl6dl im not sure if you meant to be critical of what i said or not but it came across as such are you suggesting that people like myself should not watch the channel because we are too poor to afford such an expensive vehicle or we should watch all vehicle reviews regardless of the price so we can feel sht when we come to learn that a great vehicle being reviewed is beyond our resources to even consider buying i have been watching this channel for 5 years not only for the vehicle reviews but all the other great content arent i allowed to make a suggestion of the content
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,jack looks like a cross between jimmy out of boardwalk empire and the posh guy out of titanic ie kate winslets boyfriend
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,just another overpriced ev and dont mention insurance costs
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,it is also available with a petrol engine which has a much lower starting price
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,wasnt this the car that had a review so bad on carwow the review suddenly vanished off the channel
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,anyone not pushing the ev agenda will righty point out that this is utter trash on wheels and advise people to avoid it like the plague
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i think the car looks great on the outside but its a really small car not that great in terms of price  performance and seems to have iffy reliability i really wonder how it won european car of the year when the car wasnt even available for sale at the time it won unless the motoring journalists voted for in the category of best jolly or some other questionable quid pro quo
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,no sane person could claim that this car is small
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,zarlanthegreen this is a small car
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,surely this would be the perfect car for robert i hear androids dream of electric jeep
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,its a jeep that means it will break because thats what jeeps do best
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"how and why did a car that no one outside of stellantis had driven get 
world car of the year"
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4, changed hands
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,preproduction models were driven by automotive journalists on and off road along with all the other cars that were applicable for the award before they voted upon it one of the journalists involved in the process spoke openly about driving it and what he liked and didnt like about it it nearly always work this way whether you like it or not perhaps you can start your own award scheme if you dont like it
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,av_oid seems possible its just another body on an adapted platform that most people including jack will just give an its not bad comment its not even going to be sold in the usa
2023-10-31,YxpaKrbA-b4,world is a littleknown subbrand under stellantis umbrella
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,to me the avenger is simply a 208c4600corsa costing a lot more i wouldnt even though its nice
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,oof i would love to have one as my commuter here in the states drop the price in around 30k to 35k and i would bite
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,it is similar to the fiat 600e but i think this jeep will be more available in the usa than a fiat version
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,gregyohngy from what i have found there doesnt seem to be any plans for them to bring it to the us
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"a little dubious about the assertion that its the batteries that make nonchinese vehicles more expensive

instead i think there are better causes we can identify

1 labor  every other item that is made in china vs any western country is cheaper because of cheap labor 

2 subsidization  the ccp has identified for whatever reason that making evs is good for china and their export market and have adjusted their industrialization accordingly

3 sharing tech across companies  this one i have less evidence of but it seems reasonable that the way chinese businesses operate there is a lot more tech sharing than in western capitalist countries yes chinese companies compete with each other but their intellectual property laws are a lot more lax than in the west as a result western companies have a lot more expenses reinventing the wheel so to speak with ev drivetrains

4 yes the batteries may be less expensive but for a different reason im willing to wager that the materials that make up chinese batteries cost those companies less

5 and then on the fault of the wests side evs are competing more with existing ice sales when a consumer doesnt have an ice vehicle to choose from they are going to get an ev in china while there are plenty of ice vehicles most of their oems are pure ev plays thus they arent comparing the cost of the ev development and sales with ice vehicles western oems are investing in two or more powertrain lines and so they divide up their revenue accordingly this makes ev development appear more costly vs sales"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,not coming to the us wtf 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,nice review and well done for being brave enough to wear that polo shirt 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,can we start the video with a warning that says no 1 pedal driving such a bummer i think thats the best feature of any ev i have driven
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,jeep   fiat
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,this is not going to be reliable
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,there was and is no hype 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,looking back at the dodge avenger they could have sported it up a little or save that name for a real sports car
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i love jack and his car reviews
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i dont
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,me neither
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i think stellantis have flogged this drivetrain too long still no ev ground up platform which i think is now time overdue meanwhile it needs a 60kwh premium battery option and proper onepedal driving even if just an option rather than default all the variants peuguot citroen ds opelvauxhall are popular which is good but they are all just missing some je ne sais quoi
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,im really disappointed that they didnt bring this to the us
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,expect it to arrive in 2024 like the new fiat 500e

2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,the car industry has to recognise there is a massive cost of living depreciation but still price the cars as if there is a multitude of people who can afford 40k for an entry level ev the chinese are gonna smash european ideals about pricing because they have the infrastructure to produce cheaper affordable evs which will  in the long run profit
2023-11-22,YxpaKrbA-b4,"the china car market domestically is 80 of the rest of the world combined their right and left hand drive products appear in places that western built models dont examples volvo xc40 phevev xc60 plus a tesla model 3 and model y the list is exceedingly long saic gwm byd all produce rhd models that will never appear in western europe or north america as an australian we took your crap when gm bought holden we suffered through amc harley davidson opel and a bunch of japanese cars that were either assembled locally or completed with locally supplied parts after people and companies stopped buying the ford falcon and holden commodore we realised every single company in the market had come to rip us off gm took 190m in subsidies the year before it closed all manufacturing ford got fined 10m for anti consumer behaviour only the koreans and chinese have been transparent about their dealings with australia 

stellantis we are on to you"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,jack it is strange that the fiat 500e that i have dose have one pedel driving
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,im glad to see some companies are not jumping into the touchscreenforeverything train and are instead keeping actual physical buttons for essential controls
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,fisket ocean  ripp off
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,jack dose the tail gate on the jeep sound the same as the fiat 600e ie a revering lorry
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,when giving figures for mileskwh please compare to other cars in same class not to previous gen from same manufacturer
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,wow we are really that far from a smallmid size 20k car
2023-10-31,YxpaKrbA-b4,only twenty grand away
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,coughwagen excuse me 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"5k more buys a model y
which comes with 8 cameras and 17 speakers"
2023-12-18,YxpaKrbA-b4,and the tesla super charger network and more range and more performance more interior space electric tail gate sentry mode ota updates etc
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,whats the battery chemistry
2023-10-30,YxpaKrbA-b4,"its a nmc 811 lithiumion

lithiumnickel manganese cobalt linimco less weight  more energydense than lfp thermal runway at 220c10444f good for long lifecycle and high loading"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,you made a good point about tch in a car i have had cars as well as my wife where afyter a while you only use the basics which apply to you for your own comfort for example lane assist got but never used it blind spot feature never used it  need i go on we are bamboozled into options we really wont use in the long yterm or just switch off because they become annoying
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,so basically the same size as a vw tcross petrol but 16k more
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,avenger is also going to come in a cheaper and more affordable petrol version
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,so you basically get a model 3 with the same money no thanks for the jeep
2023-12-18,YxpaKrbA-b4,in america the model 3 is considerably cheaper than this  probably why it will never make an appearance the other side of the atlantic
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,that is pretty cool but i find myself wanting an i3 more every day  nothing compares in my estimation
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,until you want to open the back doors and realise you cant without opening the front as well lol
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,meh 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,question you drive in the most beautiful country roads testing it on all front      why do you call it a city car
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,love the look but its not a jeep if it is a 2wd  4wd pretender feels such a fake image to portray
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,the silicon implants of the new car world
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,although a bit technical would appreciate battery chemistry and heat pump info be included in fully charged reviews
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,exactly you are essentially buying a battery when you buy an ev
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,battery chem is a key consideration for ev selection
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,ladaussie so youre putting battery chemistry over range being the most important thing when buying an ev
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,its nmc and yes respectively
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,jvoric correct 
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,also what kind of motors and what electronics  what software
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,sunmancrucial if you also use the battery stationary for your home appliances will become awesome when the next generations of sodiumion batteries appear since they have way more charging cycles than even lfps

2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,youve come to the wrong reviewer
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,good note we can add this into the lower third graphics you see going forward
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,a key not the key depending on use case i could see it being more important than range but undoubtedly the most important for most people is cost  jvoric
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,jvoric yeh range when you do to and from work shop and local locations chemistry more important get home put on charger repeat
2023-11-11,YxpaKrbA-b4,druste 
2023-11-18,YxpaKrbA-b4,cant help with all their reviews but the avenger does have a heat pump as standard on all variants and the traction pack is nmc lithium nickel manganese cobalt li nimnco 811 lithiumion 17 modules 102 cells thermal runway at 220c10444f
2023-11-18,YxpaKrbA-b4,"jvoric i think if the op is sure the winter range will easily cover his dailyweekly needs then pack chemistry is important eg nmc li nimnco are more energy dense and by this fact have the potential to have a greater range plus due to their valued constituent materials theres a high likelihood of the pack being recycled at its eventual end of life thermal runaway occurs at 220c10444f which can be caused by puncturing the battery their cratingchargedischarge cycle life is 500 to 2000 80 discharges

whereas lfp lithium ironphosphate lifepo4 are heavier than nmc but less energydense and thus have less potential range especially in cold temps than packs with cobalt and due to less valued chemistry lfp packs are less likely to be recycled thermal runway occurs at 270c518f lfp batteries can withstand puncture without going into immediate thermal runaway their cratingchargedischarge cycle life is 2000 to 5000 80 discharges"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,man i wish that we got the jeep in the states
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i never thought someone could make a jeep feel like a toy car  jack is too tall
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,better than lexus lbx 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,yeah not paying 40k for a jeep just to have the doors be stuck on i mean come on why am i buying a jeep if i want the doors by default
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i wonder if they could do one pedal driving through an update  i really like these but wont buy one without one pedal driving
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"thanks for the fun item
we used to own many jeeps different sizes and forms like landcruiser but also a small fun suzuki lj80 and even several vw 181 
but they never ever looked like some boring suv 
avenger will start at 38500 not impressive at all but expansive
we have good hopes for the citroen ec3 situated in the bclass 
it will cost around 24000 and have a 320km range and 100kw fast charging that is impressive and affordable"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,small daily runabout with no rear leg room and 220 mile range for 40k but you get a shelf to dump your  in  only 2 moves to switch lane assist off  stellantis are still way off the mark
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,half of the glovebox is taken up by the fuse box on rhd cars so the shelf is a necessity
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,honestly this car should have topped out at around 32k
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,small how is it small exactly
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,zarlanthegreen i have a peugeot e2008 and im 61 and can sit behind the drivers seat alright i would say though my head scrapes the roof in the rear passenger seats i have to lower the drivers seat so i can comfortably drive it
2023-10-31,YxpaKrbA-b4,i think stellantis will find a few marks
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,great job jack
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,my 3000kg vivaro e life does nearly 3miles per kw so 44miles per kw in this aint very good 10miles per kw should be a bench mark now
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,the reason for cheaper chinese evs is that they are subsidised up the wazoo by the chinese government  the eu is already getting miffed about this  dont expect cheap chinese imports except maybe in the uk for that much longer
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,as soon as you mentioned the price i stopped watching
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,everyone is everyone rather than a few
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,when a 4wd consumes less than a 2wd coz of more regen why would one build a jeep or any other suvish vehicle without 4wd back then we took our 200quattro or s4 offroad despite of a lowered clearance i dont need airbags or assistants but a sliding sunroof and awd are essential
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,just got my avenger last week your review is spot on the good and the bad
2024-02-13,YxpaKrbA-b4,got mine in october and fully agreed  love it so much
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i had a jeep renegade when we first got an ev and honestly i just want stellantis to go bankrupt their servicedealership system is so toxic in the states at least youve got to think these are the same people who have been flooding the world with mediocre 4door wranglers and haunting us with trashy chargers and challengers for decades
2023-10-29,YxpaKrbA-b4,haunting lol and who is us you mean you
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,pity stellantis will build a electric jeep  then not sell it in the us
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,it is also available with a petrol engine which is more affordable
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,fake jeep
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,regarding the talk about the price at the end i would say no thats not the point the point in most companies is to make as much money as possible for their shareholders this means that they will charge whatever they think people will pay for the product while trying to minimize costs
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,true so if fully charged really want to see prices come down to real prices their reviews should not rave about cars that are over priced jack seems to be enthusiastic about every ev his clapometer shows full for everything he reviews and by now is not a valuable gauge of anything dont get me wrong i love his enthusiasm but if your fuelelectric gauge always showed full it wouldnt take long before youd start to think you cant really trust that in your decision making for some of us an extra 10 grand is a lot of money just for a shelf to put stuff on  that you would normally put in the glove box out of sight keeping the dash tidy 
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,paowens paowens hes enthusiastic about every ev because fully charged is there to promote evs in general and the transition to sustainable energy use its not for critical car reviews and thats fine as long as you know it
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,looks pleasant  inoffensive i can see why people like it 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,in addition to 1pedal driving  we should also be able to coast when we lift our right foot this is the most efficient  think how we ride a bicycle regen is great  for when we need to slow down but much of the time coasting is better  because you accelerate less and using the moving mass of the vehicle  to move the car forward  is the most efficient way to do that
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"i havent driven an ev is there not a zone in the middle of the pedals travel at which there is neither power input to the motor not drawn off with regen

i suppose there would need to be a clever clutch to disengage the motor from the drivetrain to allow it to freewheel and then reengage to regen and do it all seamlessly as the pedal moves through its range of motion"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,all the vw id cars do that in d mode while having the benefit of regen kicking in when the sensorsgps detect cars bends roundabouts etc
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,andrewhelgecox yes but this takes effort and you cant do it as well as just lifting your foot
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"fusflash1 well  yes and no we have had 2 egolfs and they did this but our id4 only does it on the highway on smaller roads it has variable regen on down slopes and only coasts on level ground which misses much of the point

hyundai and kia evs have coasting modes which is great but they default back to mild regen each time you start the car"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,neilblanchardwe have a us kona ev and at startup my wife puts it into sport and reduces regen to 0 with the right regen paddle  i drive eco which i have saved to 3  the option is good  and lane keep is off because my wife found it annoying we dont have acc or lane following
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,fusflash1 my 2022 eniro does that to and ive got flappy paddles to make changing the regen easy
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,andrewhelgecoxin our nissan leaf i try to hold the pedal in a coasting position by seeing that the instrument report neither consumption nor regen but its at best a guess difficult to hold and not even at a fixed point in the pedals travel so its a complete pain if you go straight from power to regen you are sacrificing energy to the inefficiency of the motor twice so you do not get back what you used around town one pedal driving is nice and easy but for efficiency what i want is at least the option to coast on lift off but have regeneration triggered by the brake pedal only bringing in the friction brakes when the motor cant slow you fast enough and in contrast to the muttering rotters i would like a nice clear change in pedal feel at that point so that i can learn how much i can slow without bringing the friction brakes in im pretty sure kiahyundai cars can do this without the clear change in pedal feel but i wish reviewers would report on every cars ability to do it its not easy informs to find
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,neilblanchard my id3 behaves most of the time correctly with the eco assist option on regen on down slopes kicks in only if it reaches the speed limit otherwise it coasts well i have to agree that it is not perfect and sometimes it does not know what to do
2024-04-13,YxpaKrbA-b4,"yes i have an mg zs i dont mind working the pedals to work it to coast 
i have found weakest regen setting lets me coast moreso buuut on my testing i get less back than moderating it myself"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,never an suv never ever maybe a crossover but not likely
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,whilst the jeep is close to 40000 and it sounds like a very large sum for a small car there may be a way to bring that down to a more manageable amount i have a similar citroën ec4 and new it was just over 36000 however  i lease it for just 265mth after placing 1250 as a deposit  it is a totally practical family runabout  maybe in a few months this jeep could be leased for around 300mth please note that my previous petrol bill was 150mth and my electric bill is around 40mth saving 100mth you could argue this off the lease cost so a new jeep for around 200mth cheap efficient  and stylish motoring
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,or a new ec3 for 23k on the road
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,rcajavus8141  indeed the ec3 could be a best seller when it comes out in 2024 hopefully it wont be too small
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,regardless of your enthusiasm  from a financial point of view none of this electric car make any sense at all which is why the electric car industry is in the trouble  that it is right now in right now this car is overpriced by at least 20k
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,everyone crazy about 20000 units ordered since 2022  full ev version
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,everyone  
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,thanks jack sharp indeed
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,my parents bought a suzuki ignis recently its so practical it makes a lot of sense to build a car which is shaped like an suv but the size of a hatchback you get extra room and height but without the footprint
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,no you get way more room and height internally if you have an actual hatchback instead of a crossover suvs and crossovers have many drawbacks and zero benefits a hatchback more room even if they are smaller and if it doesnt have enough room get an estatestation wagon all the while being far lighter and easier to get in and out of
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,"zarlanthegreen im not sure what youre basing that on im pretty certain the ignis is a lot roomier than hatchbacks with a comparable footprint like the swift or the hyundai i10

when i say height i mean driving position i dont know about the headroom"
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,"andybrice2711 i checked and the ignis only has four seats unlike the other cars you mention it has a little more space in the boottrunk but not nearly as much as the space in the fifth seat of the other two cars
as for having a higher position
that has no notable actual benefit"
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,love an ignis me
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,"ahh yeah it is a shame they removed the 5 seat option the boot is pretty huge though

i vastly prefer the high driving position firstly the seats are at buttock height so you dont have to climb in and out

secondly im sure its easier to judge distances when youre higher up ive heard people claim that science says otherwise but im entirely unconvinced by their reasoning stereoscopy plus triangulation seems a lot more effective than stereoscopy alone both intuitively and logically"
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,andybrice2711 it has less space for luggage compared to the hatchbacks you mentioned so youre clearly wrong there and triangulation is obviously used with all vehicles so you have no leg to stand on there and you think you personal 100 subjective and biased experience is better than several independent rigorous investigations of countless carsdrivers that do their best to eliminate bias and confounding variables i dont even need to point out the issue there
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,"zarlanthegreen nah i just looked it up the ignis does have a larger boot granted only slightly larger by volume though but i think it is also a lot more cuboidshaped so it can more efficiently hold boxes and cases

it is possible that my sense of better depth perception is all psychological and really its just my dumb monkeybrain feeling _big thing above me  scary small thing below me  fine_

but that doesnt seem to add up to me like obviously whenever anyone wants to position their vehicle accurately they look at the ground to triangulate when youre finely judging the distance to the vehicle in front you look at the back wheels or bumper when youre parking in a tight space you might tilt the mirrors down to see the wheels and bumpers relative to the ground

maybe there are other nuances or factors i havent considered im always up for being convinced by empirical evidence that my perception of the world is completely distorted but so far i havent seen anything with enough rigour to persuade me that triangulating object positions relative to the ground is purely habit and doesnt actually work"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,amazing vehicle like the ford explorer electric which is also not coming to north america brilliant
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,youre british afaik how on earth did you miss vauxhall off your list off stellantis sub brands mr motoring journalist 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,this mans rings are pissing me off for some reason
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,the electric hyundai kona  eniro are better than the avanger in every way more efficency more range torque and power  this jeep is overprice
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"notes from an avenger owner
333 jeep avenger is either pure petrol or full electric the fiat 600 will have a hybrid variant
654 the reversing camera doesnt have any protections so mud dust or rain will make it sorta useless requiring you to get out and cleandry it
1501 there are no climate control in the back not even a duct from the front so whoever is in the back needs to rely on the front heated seats for comfort in the winter or whatever gust of wind from the main hvac outlets on the dash in the summer

your car seems to be equipped with the optional leather  electric control seats id love to hear feedback on them my first edition couldnt be specced with them and every local dealer wouldnt stock them so it has been a nagging thought since ordering it if they are any good or not"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,mild hybrid or bev
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,stevenjones916 the 12 gse t3 or puretech if you prefer psa branding engine doesnt even have the mild hybrid part its a simple petrol engine
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,awesome
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,nice review jack please keep railing against the socalled driver aids until the motor industry gets the message that we just dont want this nonsense
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,love that its cheap to run but how much will i sell it for in 10 years time when the battery needs replacement
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,ncap are already working on taming down the adas options  configurability
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,so jeep is how stellantis is bringing peugeot and vauxhall to america  cool
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,jack aka lord of the tombac rings
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,simply absurd that its not being sold in the us
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,us safety regulation mandates that all vehicles should be able to mow down cyclists without them suffering this doesnt pass the test as it barely cripples them
2023-10-31,YxpaKrbA-b4,stla figures avenger would tarnish the brand
2023-11-02,YxpaKrbA-b4,it is an insult to jeep brand
2023-11-22,YxpaKrbA-b4,stellantis would be sued out of existence in a year
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,can you test the range as none of these ev s for 1000s of pound get the range they are advertised   most get only 50 to 70 of their range   that is just false advertising  and people cannot waste there money  what is the insurance on them not a very helpful program
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,why can all electric cars get the outside looking so good but the dash is just an ipad glued on
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,no way at that price
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,still too wide still to compromised still to costly
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,make the indicator noise sound like the blasters on a star wars walker pew pew pew pew  id have that
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,now were talking
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"40k kona is still top of my list gonna be a few more years until electric is in my purview
electricheads say purview
its not the batteries that are expensive  you know where i got that from this channel  so the mind boggles where the money is going
edit great review team "
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,purview
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,its an import the price is set by the automotive cartels in china a model 3 is 28k because the excellent chinese evs are both better and cheaper if china brought those prices to the uk the govt would add an import tax to bring them up again oh 40k is the threashold for tax as well also given the lack of servicing the dealers need extra  on the sale
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,theyll never be cheaper than they are right now prices generally dont go down yes i know tesla just slashed their prices but that just shows they were charging too much to begin with
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,the price of new tech always go down think laptop computers digital cameras large flat screen tvs etc etc etc evs are the same we are just going through the initial stage of high price small enthusiast driven demand wait 510 years and prices will plummet
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,not true  costs to build these are falling  and competition in the market will drive prices down always happens
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,scotts comment sounds exactly like a car salesman convincing a poor family to buy outside their means 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,full length shelf eh like a siii land rover from about 1971 somewhere you can put stuff that doesnt slide into the footwell the first corner you go round i approve
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,erm440 grand 40 grand isnt that like   the price of the base tesla model 3 cute as this isseriously
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,very extreme jack 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,so gnarly
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,in europe volvo ex30 is more powerful and with a rear wheel drive at the same price it also has opd and it is a more premium brand i think jeep is overpriced
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,1100 for any metallic colour on the summit model the other options arent cheap either avarice is the biggest turn off for car buyers
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,thanks jack 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,fullchargedshow  1635  will you please do a ten minute full on explanation of what jack is talking about  thank you
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,im seriously considering doing this
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"but to summarise euro ncap wont give a 5 star rating without lane keep assist or if it can be switched off just by pressing a button i think  and they require that it has to be turned back on every time you restart the car jeep have been clever because the button opens the screen where you can turn it off so 2 presses required and 5 rating preserved 

the nissan ariya has got lka right though you can set your own preference for both sensitivity and intrusiveness on the lowest level of intrusiveness it doesnt yank the wheel at all just makes it vibrate so it wont cause an accident but it might still help prevent one as it is supposed to and the best bit is those settings can be chosen once and theyll be retained unlike turning it off altogether"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,40k no way i get this over a volvo ex30 which is what i likely move to from my peugeot e208 shameful that stellantis doesnt have 1pedal driving by now
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,ex30 review inbound shortly 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,jackscarlett1 dead chuffed about that
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,you tell it jack  ive got a 2020 kia niro ev and theres no way to turn off lane keep assist other than turning off the cruise control  i love my car i love adaptive cruise control but the two features on my car that makes it considerably worse are lane keep assist and the backup alert sound which on my year  model is unreasonably loud
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i dont understand what youre saying i have a 2019 enirol here in france one of the first to come into the country and i can turn off lca using a button just to the left of the steering wheel the problem is that the button is obscured by the steering wheel cruise control default is off and lca still works when cruise is off
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,kiaenirodiariesencore4270  in us models that button does not exist
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,8antipode9 reallyso you cant turn it off at all i live in rural france which has mostly empty back roads some with white lines down the middle some not if the road has a white line the lca is a pain so i turn it off the button cannot be seen from the driving position but ive had the car nearly 5 years now so i know where to hit it hope yours has been good ours is at 91000 km now55000 milesand its been rock solid so far
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,kiaenirodiariesencore4270 if the cruise control is on then the lane keep is on so technically yes you can turn it off  its a real nuisance when you pass by an off ramp and the car sees that shoulder line running off and the wheel gently jerks to try and send you down the offramp  i spent a while googling to figure out a way to use cruise without lane keep and it does not seem to be possible also where i learned of the button on the eu models  overall though i love my car and would say hands down its the best car ive ever owned
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,you can turn it off press and hold the lda button its the same for all of hyundaikia products
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,hold down the lda button on the steering wheel its there
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,dreadpirateflappy  hmmm im sure i tried that  ill try it again next time im on the highway  i will be overjoyed to be wrong
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,the new toyota prius comes on all wheel drive but not this jeep  the worlds turning upside down
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,wait 6 months and pray jeep isnt reliable
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,is this supposed to be real technology that makes sense because it sure has a lot of compromises for something that makes absolutely no sense like they deliberately made it lame to make it feel real i stink therefore i am
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i am not sure why stellantis has chosen to make any of these city cars  it dilutes the brand  im not saying this car shouldnt exist but it should be a dodge or something  i suspect it has to do with regulatory compliance
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"its a jeep no 40k no no no 
as for car of the year how much did they pay for that"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,far too expensive no additional value over the competition will sell some to enthusiasts but the rest of us will not buy it
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,theres more important points at hand it doesnt matter how efficient or cheap evs become markets are forcing better battery technology to constantly be produced the big energy companies are never going to lose out so the price of electricity will continue to rise until it costs the same or more as running a petrol or diesel your home energy bills will continue to sky rocket and will rise more and more as renewables grow make a program about the problem in hand
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,hmmi thought that the prices of electricity are actually going down as more companies move to using renewable options  in any case ive got a solar install on my house so i dont really care that much about what prices the big energy companies want to charge for electricity
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,ill be surprised if they sell many at that price
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,getting serious huh hes still horizontal 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,its good at being a car but pretty terrible at being a jeep you couldnt go green laneing in it you cant fit a winch and rock sliders its not a jeep its a branding exercise for people who care about marketing more than they care about the vehicle stellantis should put one of their many other brands on it and then itll be fine
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,is the merger to reduce costs or increase profits
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,both i suppose
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,too expensive
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,especially considering this only has a 50 kilowatthour battery
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,as soon as he said this one is 40 grand i stopped watching  that price is in pure lunacyland
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,how much should a new car cost these days especially one that is so cheap to run
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,usersd3ik9rt6d 30k for plasticy lowcost ev city car is about the current rate see midspec peugeot e208 by stellantis for comparison
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,it costs 1100 for any metallic colour on the model he tested
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,usersd3ik9rt6d a midrange vw polo rline costs around 25k if fuel is 170litre and the polo does 45 mpg id need to drive 87000 miles to burn up that 15000 difference in price and thats pretending the jeep would cost nothing to charge up ever but to drive 87000 miles in the jeep at 45 mileskwh 34pkwh the electricty will cost you 6500 so perhaps the little jeep could be reasonable priced up to about 30000 maximum
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i cant yet afford any of the cars fully charged review but ill still watch the whole video i mean come on its jack hes delightful
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i stopped at multi energy platform these companies still designing new petrol cars this late in the game they deserve to buy all their credits from tesla in the uk
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,its just another overpriced  stellantis group creation ive not watched the whole video yet 257 in but youd be better off buying a second hand e208 probably be same drivetrain
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,origin178 you are right on paper but look at energy prices over the last 10 years if governments werent subsidizing fossil fuels or stop doing it how much would you be willing to pay to go electric
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,origin178 youre 100 right would take the average user 8 years to recoup the cost of electric version assuming they get free electricity for life lol im all for electric cars but they are ridiculously overpriced 40k for an urban car the size of a fiesta where are folk finding all this money from
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,why buy a fiat at tesla prices
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,grow up
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,origin178 a midrange polo costing 25000 is obscene in itself
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,stellantis puts crazy prices on their cars then they have to put huge discounts to sell
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,exactly the price is ridiculous for a bsegment crossover its one big piece of plastic
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,origin178true but money isnt everything you just cant compare the driving experience of any half decent ev with a polo for 25k you can get a used ev instead and then you dont put another vehicle on the road that will spew out exhausts for the next 1520 years
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,that number is even worse when converted into usd at 48600 or 66800 cad  the average cost of a new car in the us is around 45000 or around 60000 in canada
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,covid is over stellatis cars now sell new for 30 off
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i agree you can get a volvo ex30 for a few grand cheaper like whattt
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,what  40k   youre joking 1140
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,at some point fully charged will have to make objective car reviews the every electric car is wonderful type reviews are wearing a bit thin now people buying an electric car are aware of the benefits and need real reviews
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,im not a fan 
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,there are cheaper models
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,the refreshed tesla model 3 also now starts at a shade under 40k and my goodness do you get more for your money

biggest downer is that this is not a pure ev so the room is poor and you will be able to get the same car for 1015k less with an engine which would be gutting"
2023-10-28,YxpaKrbA-b4,comments like this annoy me how about comparing apples with apples how much does a comparable vw ev cost oh thats right  the vw evs pale in comparison to this except for the buzz van which costs over twice as much
2023-10-29,YxpaKrbA-b4,"origin178incorrect most evs are charged at home at night when rates are far lower also the gas would be triple or quadruple in cost and the cost of gas tends to increase more over time

ice vehicles typically cost more for maintenance and repairs though also factor in the costs of air pollution that is toxic to humans and greater carbon emissions from fossil fuels for climate change impacts and ev is much more economical then add the cost of disastrous oil spills from the oil and gas industry and the ev wins with ease"
2023-10-29,YxpaKrbA-b4,kenzohkw its all incorrect total cost of ownership can be less
2023-10-29,YxpaKrbA-b4,jakerichardsong yes it can be less but thats not a good enough it should be less but it wont be for a long time for the average consumer over time itll become more affordable for the general population like most things but at the moment it does not provide an immediate benefit for those that need it most and cannot afford to replace their exisiting ice vehicles
2023-10-30,YxpaKrbA-b4,"1st edition was 37500 but there were only 2000 of them

on the road prices as of oct 23 are still high but its only the top one thats a tad under 40k
base spec 35700  longitude
mid spec 37400  altitude 
top spec 39600  summit"
2023-10-30,YxpaKrbA-b4,"jvoric on paper yes but the e208s range is approx 34s that of the jeep and the e208s efficiency per kwh is approx 15 less compared to the jeep im not a jeep fan but if running costs are quite a bit more id take the jeep having said that the features you get for the price are not that great there an optional pack for this and an optional for that you even need to pay extra for the emergency tyre puncture kit 25

then theres pay for optional extras for led front lights led rear lights heated seats rubber mats including that flippy cover front fog lights and the lists go on

second thoughts youre correct the avenger is just too much for what little you get as standard"
2023-10-30,YxpaKrbA-b4,reggiebuffat that says it all right there though im not a fan of nearly everything via menus
2023-11-05,YxpaKrbA-b4,holy moly so much plastic for 40k
2023-11-18,YxpaKrbA-b4,totally agree with you 40k for this toy if hed said 32k id have thought it was expensive but about the going rate 40k is ridiculous electric is only cheap to run while your government allows it once we all have it theyll ramp the cost up make hay while the sun shines as they say
2023-11-30,YxpaKrbA-b4,sbomorsethats some expensive paint
2023-12-17,YxpaKrbA-b4,"the volvo ex30 is made in china
the jeep avenger is made in poland"
2024-01-17,YxpaKrbA-b4, 40 k
2024-03-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,dont worry it went down to 30k on the jeep website
2024-06-08,YxpaKrbA-b4,one price upfront another behind we will see what it will really cost
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,the solution for the price problem make the chinese evs expensive by issueing 50 import tax for them that wont make eu cars cheaper but at least makes them competitive
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,my fiat 500e has propper onepedal driving
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,for normal people 5mileskwh is 12kwh100km
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i prefer kmkwh myself you just have to multiply it by the net battery capacity to figure out the range
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,thank you
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,how is that easier
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,my vivaro e life 8 seater bus 3000kg does 29mile per kw this car is half the size should do minimum 6kw mile
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,manikdesign it might be half the size but its not half the frontal area which has a massive impact on range and efficiency at speed
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,because more numbers is easier
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i dont know what you coughed
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,came here to see if anyone does know
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,the cough was to mask the initials vw
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,johnnodge4327   thx
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,im sure its a very good car like most stellantis cars unfortunately its a jeep in name only it has the ground clearance of a turtle now an electric suzuki jimny or swb pajero would be great
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,the jimny could only fit a small battery so wont really be viable
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,ajackofspades most evs have a much larger battery capacity than is required to complete the vast majority of journeys its mostly down to marketing that cars come with a lot more than 60kwh capacity even a 40kwh battery would more than cater for most jimny drives theyre not long distance cruisers
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,what a fabulous review
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,wish theyd sell this in the us
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,jeep recon is coming just below the wrangler basically
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,but will you guys buy it  isnt the us still about big big and bigger 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,nisseohlsenbelieve you are right us people wont buy it
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,actually i think there is already a demand for this in the us
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,nisseohlsenwe need them
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,pottery4life in this world or in an ideal one 
2023-10-31,YxpaKrbA-b4,dont you like americans
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,arent all those brands known for not great reliability lol   saying that though i like the looks of the car and the fact its small and electric is good
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,my friend has an 8v fiat punto that he bought second hand for the equivalent of 4500 euros its done more than 280000 kilometers more than 150000 since my friend bought it 3 years ago its never let him down and worn parts are dirt cheap to replace id call that incredible value for money operating costs are largely gas and insurance which is dirt cheap as well since the engine is only a 12 liter  plus he gets great gas mileage
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,nisseohlsen nice anecdote shame it means literally nothing in reality
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,kristoffer3000 so you think that reality means nothing in reality 
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,jeep is a top offroad brand as in you see them pulled off to the side of the road all the time because they broke down
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,speedstrn this platform is tried and tested the peugeot e208 and the opel corsa electric have run it for more than 3 years with tremendous success
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,speedstrn haha  nice seems to me that a lot american car brands has problems lately especially with their ev versions of cars
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,nisseohlsentremendous success as in a corsa e is half its new price at 24 months and 18k miles old if you can get one of those for 15k why buy this one at 40k to lose 20k in 3 years i think the key strategy here is salary sacrificebusiness lease
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,your spelling of landrover is incorrect
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,nisseohlsenwho cares that means nothing
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,ssyw7vo  to some 50 million italians it does
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,andyvalentine1243  funny thats not the case here in denmark at all where are you at 
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,nisseohlsen a platform great on one car doesnt guarantee it is on another
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,"reliability is not actually reliability it is true that for instance french and italian car brands are not known for reliability but for their cheap price and low upkeep costs
on the other hand german brands are also not known for reliability these are mostly luxury cars requiring high maintenance thus high upkeep costs
japanese car brands are actually known for reliability like cars running 100000 km without maintenance and without anything breaking
but with evs where many mechanical components are gone the reliability is likely to shift a lot 
there are different expectations on what reliability means is the german car reliable because you spend a lot of time and money to ensure that it operates properly or is the japanese definition more to your expectation of reliability where a car just operates properly for a very long time without you having to spend time andor money to make sure it is working properly
it would be easy to say that most people might favor the japanese way but in germany that is not the case japanese cars are almost nonexistent here even though they dominate many other markets this is because there are people who define reliability in the sense of the german car example and they want the luxury these cars promise"
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,never ever ever buy a jeep they literally have the worst customer satisfaction in the world they are unreliable  if you get a lemon even in the unlikely event that the dealer wants to do the right thing corporate jeep definitely wont avoid this company at all costs
2023-10-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,rardingo what nonsense this jeep is directly based on the peugeot e2008 meaning it is on a totally different platform and shares absolutely zero parts with other jeep models the only thing people should be avoiding is the bullshit stereotyping from those that no nothing about it
2023-11-04,YxpaKrbA-b4,bw1376 i think he talks about jeep before the stellantis era had an older one with a 52 litre v8 very nice car built quality wasnt very good but for me it was reliable and comfortable and it was strong could pull an overloaded trailer out of the forest without problems after stellantis got them i dont know how good they are but with the new engines i wasnt interested to buy one i remember i was to the technical inspection and he looked at the rusty brake line and wasnt sure about it he called for the workmate that had more experience with american cars and asked what he thinks he only said look how thick that brake line is compared to european cars there is enough material no problem i think under stellantis control this brake lines will be thinner
2023-11-04,YxpaKrbA-b4,stoapfalzrunden4150 we are now only seeing stellantis having an impact on newer models even the dodge hornet was an old fca project
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,love this review
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"sooit just needs to be 22000and it would be fantastic
however"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,how much do you think new cars built in western factories that pay their employees properly
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,usersd3ik9rt6d none of them pay their employees properly thats literally core to capitalism
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,wait 5 years more or so and it will be this price
2024-01-26,YxpaKrbA-b4,usersd3ik9rt6d  its not communism  if customer is not satisfied nobody cares how much western factories pay to employees
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i dont know if that was free music at 155 but metronomy might want to give it a listen as it seems to borrow heavily from the look
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i completely disagree similar rhythm  but thats all
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,vfrrideroh come on each grouping of notes starts with a slightly discordant synth note followed by a set of short notes in a very similar rhythm its very clearly based on it it comes on again around 940 and its clear there too
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,what a teaser
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,no news abut your scam giveaway
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,an excellent question
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"come on guyswhere is the review of the citroen c3 ev  
finally
an ev which is a sensibly sized sensibly pricedproper normal car with doorsand a hatchbackand four wheels which isnt chinese
sosomething which normal people might actually want to buy
where is the review"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,that car is basically the same as this one the only real difference is the looks and the price the citroen starts at 26k where im from while this jeep is just 24000
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,thursday
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,nope i think they are based on different modules
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,so comparing to sister cars how is this better choice than peugeot peugeot is nicer designed inside and outside so what makes this more interesting
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,i also think that 2008 might be better maybe we have to test compare ourselves
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"all stellantis has 0kg towing weight uselessat least opel 0kg on the roof
125 kwh100km"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,ive been driving for over 40 years and never needed or wanted to tow a thing most of us dont sorry it wouldnt work for you but
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"zoe also doesnt have towing from factory i have installed the zoekupplung from wolf mechanik near erding in germany
its 750kg tow capacity now thats nice i have needed it multiple times already
do these aftermarket solutions not exist for other cars"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,in the uk at least the zoe is not approved to tow so insurance here would not cover it towing also potentially invalidates the manufacturers warranty i assume youve checked thats not the case where you are mrkoenigma
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,mrirbee why would not want to tow anything are you incapable
2023-10-25,YxpaKrbA-b4,no melbournes4x never had the need to i also dont juggle garden knit and many many other things ability has nothing to do with it i dont want to  i derive no benefit from doing so
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,"wanted to be the first comment
nice video as always"
2023-10-24,YxpaKrbA-b4,loki
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,another cracking review vicky  i always enjoy your reviews
2022-11-30,VUTk4_ZrkLY,its really great to see diversity in a traditionally mens domain good on you girl your dad would be proud
2023-11-05,VUTk4_ZrkLY,a jeep with a towing capacity of zero
2023-08-21,VUTk4_ZrkLY,chuckling at the safety rating is no joke it just shows how little effort and value is put on customers lives and for that i give  jeep and the reviewer very little care safety should be the priority period wont support again
2023-05-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,excellent review
2023-05-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,very smart addition of the heat pump could have done with 4x4  rear wheel drive or a panoramicsunroof option im also hearing rumours of the ambient lighting will not be released on uk models nonetheless i feel that none of the above will be real deal breakers jeep have really tried on their first ev instalment they could be onto a winner  
2023-05-27,VUTk4_ZrkLY,i just created a top spec avenger on their website and even the top spec doesnt have sat nav its an extra 500 so its not standard on any trim level and no massage seat options either as with all jeeps over the last 10 years sadly its very plasticy inside and i mean cheap and nasty scratchy stuff and at over 40k i would expect some soft touch inside
2023-04-05,VUTk4_ZrkLY,front wheel towing a battery and vehicle weight behind is a bad idea for noneuropean markets
2023-04-04,VUTk4_ZrkLY,great car for singles i would love to have one but unfortunately with children i will have to look elsewhere ridiculous in 2023 not to use the interior space in a more clever way even if at least the back seats would scroll back for more back leg rooms would solve the issue i guess families is not the target group which is such a pitty
2023-03-31,VUTk4_ZrkLY,ive owned my jeep for almost 20 years and i love this thing there is a 4x4 version coming the looks of it knock this one out of the park but jeep is smart to release this one first to avoid sticker shock this one to me looks like a smaller us version of the compass which i also have and love
2023-03-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"no navigation in uk 
no interior dashboard lighting in uk"
2023-03-25,VUTk4_ZrkLY,come oooon dude wtf are you doing in jeep a no 4wd jeep is not a jeep what a shame jeep is doing pussies crap no 4wd no jeep 
2023-03-21,VUTk4_ZrkLY,shit review i want to see more of the car not her
2023-03-21,VUTk4_ZrkLY,too much chatting 
2023-02-25,VUTk4_ZrkLY,useless review
2023-02-21,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"jeep are owned by fiat  since that happened their rugged off road quality vanished  now they offer a fiatjeep based on a vauxhall mokka chassis i cant think of a worse combination two of the most unreliable cars on the planet combined it will be worth next to nothing after 2 or 3 years  will be like a bag of nuts  bolts to drive

avoid at all costsutter rubbish"
2023-02-10,VUTk4_ZrkLY,nice review thanks for your impressions i think its gonna be a great success 
2023-02-05,VUTk4_ZrkLY,great review and possibly my favourite looking small ev  but over 36k for a jackedup supermini sized car is pushing it a bit especially when leadin models of the larger kia niro ev and megane etech cost about the same have bigger batteries  more range longer warranties and plusher interiors lose the powered tailgate and cut the price by a few grand and it might make a bit more sense itll be interesting to see what lower spec versions will go for when launched until then ill keep my cash
2023-01-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,i spend all the time watching this video and i never saw the back of the car  
2023-01-27,VUTk4_ZrkLY,0750 gpsin airplane mode
2023-01-27,VUTk4_ZrkLY,743 gps glitching
2023-01-27,VUTk4_ZrkLY,does this support v2h
2023-01-23,VUTk4_ZrkLY,this would be a great replacement for the goofy looking renegade please bring it to usa
2023-01-20,VUTk4_ZrkLY,just a standard stellantis ev with the switchgear pulled from the fiat 500e way too expensive for what you get doubt if you would get 175 miles out of ths brick looks ok though
2023-01-18,VUTk4_ZrkLY,so the industry has managed to convince us that a 34k polo is a good deal and we are all buying it weve been paying a premium for higher ride of suvs for no reason and now the ev premium has basically doubled the price of cars over past decade madness
2023-01-16,VUTk4_ZrkLY,the front is awesome the back not so much
2023-01-16,VUTk4_ZrkLY,reminds me of a dacia dusteralthough it is based on alfa romeo tonale
2023-01-16,VUTk4_ZrkLY,seats do not look like offering the best support and no massage function in 1st edition uk as mentioned in review might offset the stiff suspension a little
2023-01-16,VUTk4_ZrkLY,010  really really love your review of the jeep avenger  therefore im subscribing  341  1026
2023-01-16,VUTk4_ZrkLY,thanks for the sub
2023-01-15,VUTk4_ZrkLY,engineered and designed in italy and built on a french platform in poland so thats clearly not a jeep
2023-01-15,VUTk4_ZrkLY,does the avenger offer wireless android auto from review it mentions apple car play is wirelesswas not sure meant  that also applies to android autogood to see it has a heat pump as standard although i hope it is more efficient than the heat pump on the e2008 which is next to useless
2023-01-15,VUTk4_ZrkLY,it does
2023-01-15,VUTk4_ZrkLY,concerned about the stiff suspension especially on the back country roads here in irelandotherwise looks a decent buywill be a long time before getting a test drive unfortunately  to test that suspension
2023-01-15,VUTk4_ZrkLY,car of the year 2023 but i have never heard of it
2023-01-15,VUTk4_ZrkLY,not a big fan of jeep cars but i like avenger its actually nice looking and with good specs ill wait for the awd version and some off road tests for now
2023-01-14,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"noooo a firm ride is not ideal god thats gonna be awful 

at least it has an ev interior that wasnt designed by a screenobsessed minimalist five yrold hate the buttons for shifting though needs a prindle"
2023-01-14,VUTk4_ZrkLY,ha ha what a slab of junk  jeep are one of the most unreliable brands out there battery power wont pull a heavy trailer very far what the heck is it for posing
2023-01-14,VUTk4_ZrkLY,european car of the year 2023 
2023-01-14,VUTk4_ZrkLY,no 4x4 means not a jeep im sure its a fine vehicle but its not really a jeep
2023-01-05,VUTk4_ZrkLY,im looking forward to the awd version it is not excluded that it comes later
2022-12-26,VUTk4_ZrkLY,for the uk im a proper jeep fan boy got a wk2  a renegade i love this avenger but not offering awd is a big mistake
2022-12-22,VUTk4_ZrkLY,so sad this wont be available in the us  this is such a better looking vehicle than the renegade  they should dump it and replace it with this
2022-12-22,VUTk4_ZrkLY,bring it to australia in 4x4
2022-12-21,VUTk4_ZrkLY,hybrid version of this suv will steal mid size suv segment mkt
2022-12-20,VUTk4_ZrkLY,its somewhat looks like duster modded with aftermarket grill lmao
2022-12-20,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"puma is pwumah
isnt it pooma"
2022-12-20,VUTk4_ZrkLY,jeep is a fiat
2022-12-19,VUTk4_ZrkLY,cap would never drive this
2022-12-19,VUTk4_ZrkLY,where the heck are all these people charging their electric cartoys its literally impossible in big cities
2022-12-19,VUTk4_ZrkLY, 39500 is good price
2022-12-18,VUTk4_ZrkLY,there is a neighbour in the area that i live that has a 78 chevy that despite of the age runs nicely question whats gonna be of all those electric cars once their batteries stop holding electricity after a while the same way every smartphone does
2023-01-20,VUTk4_ZrkLY,even old nissan leafs with dodgy batteries are lasting over 10 years you can replace the battery with a better one already this market will keep growing old batteries can be repurposed into home storage and or recycled
2022-12-18,VUTk4_ZrkLY,only front wheel drive ill pass this would be a nightmare in the snow
2022-12-17,VUTk4_ZrkLY,dacia duster look 
2022-12-16,VUTk4_ZrkLY,elf ears
2022-12-16,VUTk4_ZrkLY,this is my first time seeing the car and i had hoped to hear it has a 20l engine but well the future is electric
2022-12-15,VUTk4_ZrkLY,it reminds me of a renault doesnt look very jeep like
2022-12-13,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"pros
 looks cool
 performs well
 a lot of space for such small car

cons
 pricey
 its a jeeb so very unrealiable"
2022-12-11,VUTk4_ZrkLY,wait a dang minute a jeep with no 4x4
2022-12-07,VUTk4_ZrkLY,the old jeep looked pants  the light facelift looks really good
2022-12-07,VUTk4_ZrkLY,this is fabulous been waiting for something like this hopefully the large suv trend ends soon people who drive them that dont have an absolute necessity to look rather ridiculous considering climate change is only getting worse and the roads arent big enough for driving mistakes in those massive tanks
2022-12-06,VUTk4_ZrkLY,urghhit looks like it doesnt really know what it wants to be
2022-12-06,VUTk4_ZrkLY,the first avenger
2022-12-06,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"the mg4 is in the critics because of its lane assistant its very unreliable too aggressive and in order to deactivate it you have to swipe through the touchscreen menus several times
how is the jeep avenger in comparison how does the lane assistant feel and is it possible to deactivate it with a simple click on a hardwarebutton

what about v2l or even v2h is stellantis aware of these things i fear they didnt implement anything like that which is very sad otherwise they would for sure have mentioned it"
2022-12-05,VUTk4_ZrkLY,nothing to be excited for there is no engine in it
2022-12-04,VUTk4_ZrkLY,glad this isnt coming to the us this is an abomination lol
2022-12-03,VUTk4_ZrkLY,just wow no north american release jeep is leaving a ton of money on the table too bad cause i really like this too
2022-12-03,VUTk4_ZrkLY,surprised no preordering yet  uk
2022-12-03,VUTk4_ZrkLY,this is presented as a brand new model it kinda is but also it is the same stuff under the skin as opelvauxhall peugeot and ds
2022-12-03,VUTk4_ZrkLY,glad it is a reasonable size for uk roads in this footage it looks bigger than a polo or a juke though maybe its smaller in the metal shame about the price 34k this needs to stop now as there will be vehicles sitting on forecourts for some time  no matter what they say about orders 
2023-01-15,VUTk4_ZrkLY,price confirmed as 36500
2023-01-16,VUTk4_ZrkLY,mg3hybrid hopefully they work on that price over time
2022-12-03,VUTk4_ZrkLY,i am really loving what stellantis has been doing with jeep love this car
2023-01-15,VUTk4_ZrkLY,nothing good
2022-12-03,VUTk4_ZrkLY,the title makes me laugh
2022-12-03,VUTk4_ZrkLY,
2022-12-03,VUTk4_ZrkLY,i wonder if range will suffer on the motorway and in the cold like it does on the mokka real shame they didnt go for a bigger battery and target 300 miles
2023-01-16,VUTk4_ZrkLY,might depend how efficient the heat pump is
2022-12-02,VUTk4_ZrkLY,this better make it to the us getting fed up with us manufacturers not marketing decent products to themselves
2022-12-02,VUTk4_ZrkLY,no no no
2022-12-02,VUTk4_ZrkLY,cracking design
2022-12-01,VUTk4_ZrkLY,jeep have a terrible record for vehicle and driver safety 
2022-12-01,VUTk4_ZrkLY,is it just me or does the avenger look a bit cheap the plastic wheel trims the plasticlooking wing mirrors etc theres a good car in here somewhere but quite a few changes to be made first
2022-12-01,VUTk4_ZrkLY,front volkswagen rear peugeot
2022-12-01,VUTk4_ZrkLY,man that thing is beautiful
2022-12-01,VUTk4_ZrkLY,fwd only is a dealbreaker unfortunately if they ever come up with an awd variant ill be interested again its a shame too this cars size and proportions are just about perfect and it looks amazing too
2022-12-01,VUTk4_ZrkLY,why cant the us get this vehicle we never get the awesome tech in vehicles
2022-11-30,VUTk4_ZrkLY,i love your reviews its great to see companies really pushing the switch to electric but the last jeep we had was terrible with reliability unfortunately im interested to see how that pans out for them hopefully it gets better keep up the great reviews
2022-11-30,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"come on vicky
come down off that fence and tell us all how you really feel about this car  
also whats with the very james bondy backing soundtrack i kept expecting to see machine guns poking out from the 7bar grill or something 
personally im not a fan of suvs as they have been shown to use up around 25 more energy in production and running than a standard hatchback
however having said that i agree the avenger looks a stylish jeep design "
2022-11-30,VUTk4_ZrkLY,would have loved to see a deeper dive in media software legacy automakers struggle in making a decent ux with competitive features video notes how it has everything you might want when it doesnt show any competitive features to android automotive or new automakers
2022-12-04,VUTk4_ZrkLY,actually this _is_ android automotive jeep uses it as the basis of its incar systems across all its new models this one included i have the same system but in a different car and its fast responsive logically laid out and it supports wireless android and apple phone mirroring in other words everything you might want
2022-12-04,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"krisw1 you say that yet it wasnt ever looked at in the video 

does it have play store too so youtube netflix and music streaming can be installed because thats something user might want while charging i know i use them"
2022-12-06,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"martinzw i do know that jeep adopted android automotive as its incar os across its product range as uconnect version 5x  if this car uses a different os it would be the sole exception from jeeps recent launches

but android automotive is not android as you understand it android automotive is an operating system that is based on android and shares its libraries and services with the android phonetablettv operating system and so it is capable of running android apps but unlike android for phones car systems that use android automotive do not have to include a play store or the standard google app suite as part of the licensing agreement the manufacturer controls what apps are made available on the system not google  if you want to use streaming services in your car the best way is to use the app thats on your android phone displayed the car systems screen using googles android auto technology which is not the same thing at all as android automotive hey dont blame me it wasnt me who chose two nearlyidentical names for two completely different things 

and yes this car supports both android auto and apples equivalent carplay"
2022-11-30,VUTk4_ZrkLY,wonder what the fiat version will look like
2022-11-30,VUTk4_ZrkLY,big question for me would be reliability which jeep doesnt have a great reputation for odd choice of name too for this particular vehicle doesnt suit it imo evenger perhaps
2023-01-16,VUTk4_ZrkLY,purely ev you would think reliability should not be as big an issue as their ice models they briefly offered 5 year warranty but back to 3 years standard now i am still waiting for jeep to detail the warranty on the avenger no details given yet
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,cant help but notice the lack of passenger grab handles which is a strange omission in a car marketed as having offroad abilities  looks good apart from that  great review as always
2023-01-15,VUTk4_ZrkLY,i did spot that as well but at least the front passenger has onestrange and unfortunate omission but same as one usb in backcutting corners for that 36500 price point
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,first of jeep line to lead chrysler to bankruptcy again electric cars are a pipedream i will not be buying one no reason to brandon saying so does not work for me
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,5 miles per kwh  just no
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,this product is gonna do gangbusters in italy
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,i like it its great for cities and especially in the european market jeep is just trying to get every market they can but with their own twist in your garage you can have a wrangler for the weekend and an avenger for the the week makes sense to me great review by the wag
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,she likes it she really likes it good review thanks
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,thanks for watching
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,sticking to my kona ev not much to get excited about here
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"sobecause you like jeep as a brand this  because it has a jeep badge  its interesting practical and you like it despite the fact that it is only fwd you even dont mind the very light too light steering wheel and  you find its infotainment system ineat and tidy
but if we watch all these things because under the bonnet avenger is basically identical to ec4 e2008 ds 3 etense reviewed in a french version of cmp based b segment ev then they are unworthy and you have a slightly stiff upper lip and raised nose about them "
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,great review vicky i love this so cute 
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,my wife and i were looking forward to this coming to the us market but sadly they decided against it it wouldve been a nice addition and companion to our jeep renegade that we love  awesome review vicky
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,jeep means 4x4 cant call it a jeep unless it is 4x4 
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,wow what a funky little car this may sway us brits into buying more evs well done jeepstellantis
2023-01-15,VUTk4_ZrkLY,fiat
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,looks like a mean golden retriever puppy  a mini renegade good stuff
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,by the looks of things this is based off the latest adaptation of the ec4mokka2008208corsa platform no complaints here from me if that is the case especially as this system has proven very reliable in the aforementioned cases nice styling and scaling choices here too
2022-12-01,VUTk4_ZrkLY,its just a peugeot 2008 with jeep badging
2022-12-01,VUTk4_ZrkLY,alfrredd to be fair thats most likely no bad thing whatsoever especially as it means many of the parts shared will be ridiculously cheaper than if they were purpose built for that singular variant
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,is this related to the 2008 and mokka 
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"yep if you disregard the dimensions and styling  practically identical 
the difference is just in tech advancements made since their presentation like 2021 corsa e mokka e ec4 ds 3 cb etense e208 e2008 doesnt have the same energy density battery 50 kwh instead of 54 and some tweaks under the bonnet which all result in a longer range"
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,its all very excitingthat is until they finalise the price it will be extortionate
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,42k for the basic one cmon wake up folks
2023-01-15,VUTk4_ZrkLY,36500 is confirmed price on jeep uk for 1st edition
2023-01-15,VUTk4_ZrkLY,mg3hybrid 36500 thats ok then
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,nice to see something a bit different  price will of course be key  bet you its nearer 40k by the time it gets here
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,very nice styling
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,vicky has great knowledge and presentation skill interesting offering we have a 3008 hybrid as family 3rd car used for dogs shopping in town due for replacement in august this ticks a lot of boxes 
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,this woman provides good reviews i dont share her enthusiasm for jeeps i prefer more agile vehicles and so would prefer a polo to the avenger but i think this reporter does cover the vehicle well
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,this looks great
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,a lot of jeep pr in this review we dont get any bad points or downsides feels like they want to get invited to the next launch i guess we have to wait for doug demuro for the quirks and features
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,i think thats a bit harsh imho vickys videos are always balanced in terms of positives and negatives
2022-11-30,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"vincentohanlon i dont think red is right that this is pr  presenter just loved the car but reason why he might believe so could be related to an area important to him that was not reviewed
 software uiux and features
 interior material quality
 actual height of the passanger when she said it fits average adult nicely 
 or another"
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,vauxhall mokka e underneath  which is a peugeot 2008 e
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,not much technical information in this video i checked and  as expected its based on the same platform as the peugeot 2082008
2022-12-03,VUTk4_ZrkLY,larger battery though
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,looks like peugeot 3008 front and citroen back end another stellantis hash up
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,this is far more cohesive and pleasing to the eye than any of the french rivals from the same group perhaps the megane is a better car but thats a class bigger and more expensive the avenger is ahead of the competition
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,i think if they add a center armrest to the back as standard itd be a perfect family car and honestly would tempt me a lot
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,great review vicky 
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,another cracking review vicky  i always enjoy your reviews
2022-11-30,VUTk4_ZrkLY,its really great to see diversity in a traditionally mens domain good on you girl your dad would be proud
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,generally i have a huge dislike for anything in the suv class but this really is something different far smaller than many it looks really purposeful and quite squat
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,its a very nice looking car especially at the front with the black headlight area the interior is simple but very spacious good job jeep
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,mmmmm jury is out
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,great little ev
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,i really like the look of this just the right size for city driving too
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"ill wait for the petrol version if they dont over price it and not many will be able to afford it  
it wont be priced like the captur and juke itll be priced more as a premium version of those rivals 
b segment should be affordable not overpriced 
and the flap in the interior is cheap"
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,the petrol version is not coming
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,oliverstemp9132 it does at least in europe you have already spypics on internet
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,mjuresic it is only being sold in spain italy and a few eastern european markets not in the uk however i dont think that jeep will really lose out on much
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,oliverstemp9132 yes it is the petrol has already been confirmed
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,wayneheyes904 please read previous response
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,oliverstemp9132 please read previous post
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,wayneheyes904 youd still be wrong
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,oliverstemp9132 and so would u be
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,isnt this the alfa tonale
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,no not at all
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,love this cant wait to see it in some better colours
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,anyone else think this could replace the pensioners honda jazz
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,suvs even small ones like this are actually too high for pensioners to get in and out of i think this may be a little difficult to manage for most elderly drivers
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,thanx for review
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,the first jeep under stellantis platform since the interior looks like a peugeot with infotainment system of a citroen 
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,the software is from the fiat 500e and it has the 500 gear selector buttons
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"oliverstemp9132 no its not this is the latest stellantis infotainment system you can find in peugeot 308 408 citroen c5x etc and the drive mode button is exactly the same as in everything from  corsa 208 trough c4 and astra up to 508 and grandland
though it is absolutely possible that the latest version of 500 has the same infotainment software and drive mode selector but its not from fiat anymore"
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,mirkozlikovski9553 ive tried out all of those cars this software is clearly different from peugeot and all the others but is the same as the 500 the reason being is this is open source android automotive rather rather than bring proprietary it looks like the android automotive system has been chosen going forward the 500 was developed pre merger and is completely different from the 208 and corsa nothing is shared however it seems like future models will be a best of both hence the gear buttons from the 500
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"oliverstemp9132 funny you say that you drove them all since the new peugeot 408 is just having its first presentation tests and its not on sale yet and c5 x and new 308 are rather rare on roads since they fully went on sale in the beginning of this year 
i saw this infotainment system in person only in the new 2022 c5 x early this may my 2020 p508 sw does not have it and from what i just saw in quick checks of a few new 2022 fiat 500 e videos its system looks similar too so i kind of  doubt premerger versions of 500 have it first stellantis production car that had it was new 308 i think or may be new ds4 not sure which one of them was presented first of course my assumptions are based only by the look of the tilewidget based ui look and swiping animation of what can be seen in this avenger video that looks identical to what i saw this may when i test drove new c5 x
and the drive select mode button is exactly the same as in my p508 sw or 2020 citroen c4 "
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,mirkozlikovski9553 it really isnt the same
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,oliverstemp9132 well ok i really could not claim for sure since i havent seen this one in avenger by myself neither that in premergerr 500 but i saw the one in new p308 fiddled with one briefly in new astra and played with one in new c4 x and they all looked pretty similar to what can be seen in this video
2022-11-30,VUTk4_ZrkLY,mirkozlikovski9553 well you arent as observant as i am then
2022-11-30,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"oliverstemp9132 well may be you are  but if you are maybe you can play a bit of the spot the difference
httpsipostimgccxj3qhdwlavengerjpg
httpsipostimgccy9xp4vv9c5xjpg
and tell me if their overall ui as well as the actual tiles for widgets they bot have on screen ventilationclimate control and application drawer are the same or from two completely unrelated systems
or may be the differences in their home screen layouts
httpsipostimgcck5kcn1fhavengerhomescrjpg
httpsipostimgccyyrbsjtqc5xhomescrjpg
because to unobservant me they look pretty much identical if we disregard the color scheme and some minor brand only appearance modifications  "
2022-11-30,VUTk4_ZrkLY,mirkozlikovski9553 i love hoe far you are going with this but they are very different
2022-12-01,VUTk4_ZrkLY,oliverstemp9132  not really since after my initial post im constantly allowing the option that youre right or better said that they all are based on premerger fiat system and im just stating even with pictures why i think avengers infotainment is the same as in latest models of other stellantis vehicles 
2022-12-01,VUTk4_ZrkLY,oliverstemp9132 o btw did you spot the difference and if you did what is it 
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,its just a peugeot e2008 vauxhall mokka e in a jeep with a slightly larger battery but still has very average range
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,its bigger inside than those cars
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,nice review
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,id like a hillman avenger
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,i like however the range as with all evs is the killer for me as a rural dweller there is no infrastructure in place government is all yap and no action so its ice for me and millions until ranges improve and government installs adequate infrastructure
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,vicky definitely has the gift of gab
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,250miles so a solid 200 in real life from a 51kw usable battery in a  brick shaped car is good going
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,jeep have done some black magic visual trickery with the avenger vicky keeps saying its tiny but it looks decently sized its unfortunate its fwdonly and not available in north america it probably would need to have 240mi of epa range to be viable in the usa
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,they have an awd model for this model as an ev this would be perfect if it had more range for the us
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,yeah i wish they wouldve brought it to the states it would be perfect for my wife who commutes about 3 miles to and from work every day our renegade is fwd and to be honest i was skeptical about it at first but 5 years of solid service and 4 snow storms later i am not talk feet of snow but 2 of them were 9 deep and it did amazingly well havent got it stuck yet now the 2023 renegades are all 4x4 and theyve tamed down the color palate as well but the new dash and infotainment few more payments left then i might go snag a th renegade and have some fun build a small overlanding rig for my wife and i 
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,what exactly makes this a jeep just change the fake grill a bit and it could just as easily pass for a kia or toyota or subaru or
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"b9m3 eh youre blind  designwise this is resized compass  unless you find that compass could pass for a kia sportage or subaru crosstrek
it would be far more understandable if youd btch about it being redressed peugeot e2008"
2022-12-16,VUTk4_ZrkLY,it looks exactly like a jeep renegade which is available in na
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,its better to go with japanese cars if you want reliability in this price range but i really do love jeepthey make some good carslove the way the avenger looksbtw the review was spot onthanks again for an amazing video yet againyou guys never fail to hit the sweet spot when it comes to reviewing cars
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,care to name any japanese rivals that are fully electric with chunky off road looks in a compact size
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,we used to have an avenger  a hillman avenger
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,so what speed does it charge at how long does it take to charge  surely this should be covered in every battery car review and someone should not have to ask in the comments section to try and find out
2022-11-29,VUTk4_ZrkLY,"yeah  

ive gotta be honest i wouldve liked to have seen a lot less vicky and a lot more car in this review not just because i didnt see much of the interior but because she makes me feel anxious  there was no smiling joking or any witty comments just non stop talking but in a way that made her come across as she doesnt like her job

i couldnt find matt from carwow anywhere online for a review of this car hes got great charisma"
2023-03-05,VUTk4_ZrkLY,you can get specifications from the car manufacturers website video reviews are for telling us what its like to drive
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,definitely not an suv person but i really like the look of this
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,looks great
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,quite a neat looking car better than any vw     id still prefer the 70s hillman version though 
2022-11-28,VUTk4_ZrkLY,been waiting for this review really like this car think jeep have got a big seller on their hands i agree to many brands thinking bigger is better and not spending time or money on developing smaller models in their ranges not everyone wants or needs a giant suv that can carry 7 6ft people and drive 500miles at a time another great review vicki
