2023-10-16T22:08:27Z,@stevemccormack9948,ck7r4EQYRvw,I am going to wait till new battery chemistry comes out before buying an EV. But I do like the Mokka 1.2 Automatic,2023-10-16T22:08:27Z
2023-10-02T14:04:39Z,@evanovix,ck7r4EQYRvw,"When talking about EV range I would like to hear more specifics about how the car was driven. Motorways, cold weather or wet roads will cause the consumption to increase alot. Sports, normal or eco mode matters less than the weather conditions and how efficient you drive.

A 140 miles (228 km) range would mean a 2,1 kW/100km (or 3mi/kW) consumption on average. The only time I have seen that kind of consumption is driving uphill in cold/rainy weather. There are no motorways where I live so top speeds are usually between 45-55mph.

I saw a Norwegian winter test where the Mokka e was driven in ""slushy"" snow, 0 to -10C, and still managed a 165 mile (~260km) range. In a summer vs winter range loss comparison the Mokka e was only beaten by the Tesla Model 3. The Mokka managed 324 km (202 miles) in the summer test, which is almost bang on compared to the official WLTP range. All the EVs in those tests are driven in the most eco friendly mode, under the most ideal conditions during summer, and no high speed motorway testing.

Have had my Mokka e for a month now and my average consumption after 1100km is 1,65 kW/100km (roughly 3,7 mi/kW) This would give me roughly 175 miles of range. This is in normal or sports mode only by the way. The temperatures have been anywhere between 8 - 20C, lots of rainy and wet conditions. The car definitely does not like wet conditions (not many cars do) and this is where I have seen the highest consumption so far.

Goes without saying that since the car is brand new I have been idling alot as well as testing the acceleration 0-60, handling through corners and whatnot. Would have seen a lower average consumption if I had driven it in more dry weather conditions and without all the ""new car testing"".

I have also seen crazy low consumption when commuting to and from work. The consumption has been as low as 1,35 kW/100km (4,5 mi/kW) This was during mild and dry weather conditions of course. With those numbers I would get closer to 215 miles on one charge.

Regen vs coasting efficiency:
The cons of the Mokka e so far is that it only has D mode or B mode. In D mode it regenerates slightly so you cannot get a full coast mode like you can in the eGolf or other EVs. For downhill it is not so bad, but I notice that driving uphill/hilly roads or flat roads I keep having to throttle somewhat to maintain speed. 

Because it lacks the option to turn off the regen in D mode it then becomes less efficient than it could have been and I can imagine this only get worse on motorways. Any EV that lets you coast also lets you maintain speed for some distance without even touching the throttle, and/or you only need short bursts on the throttle to keep the momentum going.

In other words, when driving on flat roads or hilly roads it feels like the Mokka e is constantly trying to slow down whatever speed I built up. If the Mokka e had the ability to coast I would probably get 230 miles+ during the summer.

In summary: If you drive alot of motorways then you should be less concerned with the official WLTP range and look at the size of the battery instead, as well as the drive modes of the EV. To get a minimum of 200 miles on one charge you would atleast want a 60-70 kWh battery size.",2023-10-02T14:19:04Z
2024-02-02T20:34:01Z,@spacedoutET,ck7r4EQYRvw,"Agree. I have a e2008 since October 2020. I tested it on eco, normal and sport. I drive the same and get the same mileage.

2022-08-05T11:31:04Z,@amazingdanndini,ck7r4EQYRvw,"I've had my Mokka-e SRi Nav Premium for almost 6 months now. I'm averaging out 3.9 - 4.0 mi/kWh and frequently travel from Oxford to Southampton & Portsmouth.

Basically, whenever I travel to Portsmouth, I pop the car into Eco mode, just to preserve the range and usually have to give it a little top up at one of three Lidl stores on the way back through. Enough time for a bite to eat. I can do Southampton and back on a single charge with approximately 20% left in the battery.

Motorway efficiency does drop off a cliff, but I find that dropping to either 65mph or 60mph does help - yes it may take an additional 10-20 minutes to arrive, but it's a small trade off.
My biggest gripes are the rear space & boot capacity, being a new father. It's a bit difficult getting the child seat & pushchair in.

Otherwise, in terms of design, I'm not a big lover of the piano black features - an absolute magnet for grubby fingerprints; and the boot button being above the number plate, which is just bonkers to me and only adds to the aforementioned grubby mitts problem.

On the whole, however, it's a great piece of kit and I'm looking forward to see what Vauxhall can do with the rest of the range. I'd recommend the car to anyone looking at EVs at the moment.",2022-08-05T11:31:04Z

The car itself has a ""Delay charging"" facility built in which is the only way to control the charging to automatically start after midnight on a cheap tariff.  2) There is no equivalent facility to automatically stop charging before it reaches 100%.  Therefore you either have to physically stop the charging manually or allow it to charge to 100% every time which apparently isn't good for the battery.  Batteries degrade more quickly if they are frequently charged up to 100%,... apparently operating within the 20%-80% state of charge range is more advisable to look after the battery.",2022-06-01T13:14:45Z

2023-01-22T14:21:19Z,@guyfleeming1440,ck7r4EQYRvw,"@@philthompson665 Since buying our Vauxhall Mokka-E a year ago I've been charging it using the ""Deferred Charging Schedule"" facility built into the car, because it appeared that the car stubbornly refused to let our Indra (V4) charger control the charging.  Indeed a response to an email that I sent to Vauxhall querying this issue stated that they could not change or set up their cars to allow smart chargers to control the charging.  However just this last week in discussions with the installers of my Indra (V4) charger, ChargedEV, I have discovered two things.  1) A ""Compatibility Mode"" called ""Relaxed Overcurrent"" can be set on our charger which prevents the car from going completely to sleep when it is plugged in and locked, which basically means that the ""Deferred Charging Schedule"" facility built into the car is not required, and the charging of the car can indeed be controlled by the Indra (V4) smart charger (YIPPEE!!).  2) Recent changes to the software of the charger and the smartphone App for the Indra (V4) smart charger allow for much greater control of the charging, including the ability to STOP charging, and also the ability to LOCK the charger when not in use to prevent electricity theft, which in present times with sky rocketing electricity prices, may become a thing (but hope not).  Hope this helps,... someone  üôÇ",2023-01-22T14:21:19Z

It is VERY comfy, VERY quiet and VERY smooth. The elevated driving position is great too. Absolutely no issues with the infortainment and phone connections.

I have to turn the lane assist off so it doesn‚Äôt jerk the steering wheel which is annoying.
The two front windows don‚Äôt wind all the way down. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don‚Äôt. 
Car not opening with key fob, tried both fobs and only way to get in was to take the key out the fob and open the passenger door by key. Then the fob starts working again. 
The footwell vent when selected blows loud but not with a lot of force. This is because it‚Äôs not switching off from the windscreen. So my dash cam overheats and switches off. You can select other vents etc, but footwell only? Not a chance. 
My feet were cold on my morning work journey in winter.
The left circle on the dash with the eco/braking totally disappears and is replace with an amber warning light that looks like a charging cable wrapped around a pole. Apparently there is a recall on this. 
The ‚Äúdownload yourself to USB‚Äù updates that you then have to take and put on the car is a complete backwards step considering these cars are the future. Plus my car just kept saying error, so it had to go in for it doing. Customer care had to agree to pay for it too. Despite the warranty you are warned of diagnostic fees if they can‚Äôt find anything wrong ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
My car is currently in for a second time in regards to the above. I have had it 7 months (5,000 miles) and had no issues in the beginning. Now there seems to be all sorts cropping up. 
There are no specific car seat covers as yet, same with the usual accessories, still waiting. 
The rear seating area is cramped for adults and even more so if the front passengers need their seats further back. There is no lighting in the back or air vents. However there are two USB ports so I have put a couple of those LED usb lights in there to help. Boot space is limited but I have downsized from a BMW X1. 
If anyone asks me advice on electric vehicles I recommend  them to wait as there will be better designed cars with longer battery life being produced and for less ¬£. In some ways I regret changing cars, the price of fuel v and Ev (costs about ¬£2 to charge overnight) maybe 3-4 times a week. Yes it is cheaper. With ICE you don‚Äôt have to worry about filling up and going longer distances. 
The EV aspect is more charger availability anxiety rather than range. If you can‚Äôt park in the right bay for EV charging the cable won‚Äôt reach! If you get an emergency during the night or have to travel unexpectedly, the paranoia of this has you trying to keep the car topped up ! 
I had an emergency hospital visit and was low on charge. There were two chargers at the hospital that I could have used but both spaces were ICED. The hospital was no help in getting the cars moved or contacting the drivers.",2022-05-24T20:56:08Z

I agree the lane assist is far too aggressive and always gets turned off in our Mokka. The boot space is especially woeful, trips away and further afield take immense packing skills. I just can't quite get a comfortable driving position however much I adjust the seat. Range isn't great and tanks in colder weather, but all the Stellantis EVs suffer from this.

2022-06-11T14:02:04Z,@richardharrison3099,ck7r4EQYRvw,Hi Robert. We have a petrol Mokka. We have given up on the keyless entry as it is so unreliable. However we even find the key fob unreliable also we have a special trick to get into our Mokka when the key fob fails. Luckily the keyless entry works on the boot so when the key fob fails we have to open and close the boot. Then the key fob starts to work again and we can open the car.,2022-06-11T14:02:04Z

Getting in the back is another issue. So kids will be ok but if your an adult you will have issues getting in and out. We have the keyless entry. We have given up on this as it is so temperamental. Then one big issue is when we go to open the car with the key fob. We find the car will not open. The key fob stops working. So we have a trick now to get round this. We have to open and close the boot. Which I am guessing because we have keyless entry it allows us to do this. Then the key fob comes back to life. We can now open the car with the key fob. The car has been back 7 times to the dealer. Still not fixed. I have seen on other reviews other people have the same issues so I guess goes across the electric and petrol models.,2022-06-12T07:17:26Z

2024-07-07T07:57:37Z,@MrOffaB,_MUTNTT-31E,"I have said it before around YT, and I'll say it again here. No motoring journalist should ever mention the 1,2 puretech engine without an enormous caviat! Got it in my 2016 Peugeot 308 SW II, and as many other owners of cars with this engine, I've experienced massive issues with this engine! The timing belt dissolves itself over time, cause Peugeot uses ""the brilliant solution"" of having it run thru oil. The valves stick open on some cars when you floor it for overtaking, turbos have issues on certain cars. It drinks oil like nothing I've ever experienced, and that is just some examples of issues with the engine! Oh, and yes this engine eats spark plugs btw, one must change them every other year or they're likely too burn out, wich happend too me while on a long journey wich was great fun! 

The whole exchaust rusted too pieces after just 5,5 years, they keyless function on the driver door is well known for giving in on many Stellantis models.

And another amazing bit of engineering, is that almost all of the alarms on everything from the windshield washer fluid, to servere engine problems, has the same sound. So after having had 4-5 engine failures as I've experienced, there's nothing like hearing the same alarm go when your out of washer fluid!

I lost so much money on my car, and with Stellantis cars depreciating like crazy, and all the issues I personally have experienced, I simply can't afford too get rid of it either, I'm massively up side down on the morgage, and have spent an insane amount on repairs as it is.

Oh, and yes one more love nugget. Almost every time I've complained to the dealership where I live, i get the lovely response, ""yeah, that's a well known problem with these cars, but your guarantee has expired, so that will cost you so and so""!

I just write all this because I'm simply amazed how much praise this engine have gotten, but rarely, if all, there's any mention of the massive amount of issues with it!",2024-07-07T07:57:37Z
2024-07-07T18:17:16Z,@piglet5287,_MUTNTT-31E,"I'm sorry about your experience but have to question whether these problems still persist on Pure Tech engines, even wet belt ones, after about 2018. PSA changed the belt material several times, and this engine turns up in so many Stellantis models, I wonder why we don't hear of more failures. I've run a Peugeot 208, September 2020  manufacture, for over three years and the belt looks fine (you can see a section through the oil filler), it uses no oil and the spark plugs have lasted. It's low mileage but then the doomsters say it's short journeys that kill it. On the negative side, the stop/start system hardly ever operates. What I'm sure of is that you have to use exactly the right standard and grade of oil",2024-07-07T18:17:16Z

2024-07-15T15:59:03Z,@joshpipe7755,_MUTNTT-31E,"At least 4 engine failures in 8 years? I'm so sorry you've had this experience.

One source I've found helpful over the years is 'Honest John', who have been good at pointing out known faults on used models. I couldn't seem to find a mention of the issues you experienced on their 'What to watch out for' 308 SW page, though.

As of 4 July, at least in the UK, all new electric Peugeot models sold are covered for up to 8 years under their new 'Allure Care' scheme, as long as the car is serviced at a Peugeot dealer every 2 years. This looks very similar to 'Toyota Relax' that has been in place for a few years now.

Unfortunately, Peugeot's new scheme only seems to cover new, electric cars. And as much as I like them, electric cars seem to be depreciating even worse than most ICE models at the moment. To the tune of the Renault Zoe selling brand new for ¬£30k and used for ¬£15k just 1 year later. So I'm not too sure what to suggest for your situation, other than if it were me, having such an experience with the reliability of your 308 would have massively knocked my confidence in Peugeot...",2024-07-15T15:59:03Z

I can see the appeal even though a spreadsheet might suggest an alternate choice. 

Styling alone is the only rationale for choosing a DS3 E-tense the Mokka-e encouragingly has other good attributes.",2023-09-11T11:07:32Z

2022-06-19T08:54:42Z,@richardharrison3099,SEfrjS8ODjQ,So we have had a petrol automatic Mokka for 12 months. So the lane control is a pain. Getting in the back is another issue. So kids will be ok but if your an adult you will have issues getting in and out. We have the keyless entry. We have given up on this as it is so temperamental. Then one big issue is when we go to open the car with the key fob. We find the car will not open. The key fob stops working. So we have a trick now to get round this. We have to open and close the boot. Which I am guessing because we have keyless entry it allows us to do this. Then the key fob comes back to life. We can now open the car with the key fob. The car has been back 7 times to the dealer. Still not fixed. Oh Vauxhall customer service is a waste of time. I will not say what I think of them.,2022-06-19T08:54:42Z

2021-07-19T23:58:53Z,@MrECHEEx,SEfrjS8ODjQ,"At the moment im stuck between the vauxhall mokka-e, the Citroen eC4 and the Peugeot e-2008. The eC4 and e-2008 both seem to outclass the mokka but from my knowledge, Citroen and Peugeot have a history of unreliability when it comes to mechanical issues. That is however, a history and doesn't mean that they're new electric models will suffer from the same unreliability. Do you have any opinions about this?

Also great video! Very well spoken, all the useful bits of information and some really great points about some of the down sides such as visibility and the rear doors. I'll definitely be checking out your videos for the eC4 and the e-2008!",2021-07-19T23:58:53Z
2021-07-20T07:57:16Z,@TotallyEV,SEfrjS8ODjQ,"Can't comment there, as it's hard to test for reliability. However, all the vehicles you mentioned come from the same motoring group - some built even on the same vehicle platform. Groupe PSA, now known as Stellantis. So, wouldn't associate one or the other, especially, as you said, with the electric power train.

And thank you, glad you liked the video, comments such as these are very much appreciated!
Do let us know what you make of the other two. Subjectively, the e-C4 is the best out of the bunch - purely because of its comfortable seats.",2021-07-20T07:59:05Z

2021-07-19T13:51:58Z,@XENONEZZ2,SEfrjS8ODjQ,"Good review....I looked at the Mokka before deciding to buy the Kia Soul EV.
Reasons being I just felt Vauxhall have let themselves down here by offering a car that although I quite liked from a looks/design point of view simply doesn't...for the money...provide enough range or performance.
I'm finding my Soul EV will easily offer 250m of range and with over 200hp on tap it's actually a fairly quick car too with plenty of confidence inspiring instant torque.   
I was looking for a positive first experience to driving electric and the Soul certainly provides that....it's a great, well thought out vehicle....Thank you Kia...!!.",2021-07-19T13:51:58Z

2024-01-24T09:40:02Z,@TRONICSfer,RRf_qR2EzTs,"Your review is complete miss... I just had it as a rental in some medium trim, and the only thing this car is good for is roll it down the cliff... It is made for looks only, and that's where everything ends. It is unpractical, uncomfortable, not nearly decent to drive, loud and with pointless body shape (small SUV?)
It had the same 3 cylinder 1.2 turbo engine, that sounds as tractor, fuel consumption is super high for this engine size (9L/100km). This one was automatic, and I drove it moderately. In general, these 3 cylinder turbo engines are overly stressed and I don't believe they will live more than 150k km before some more serious problems. This translates to resell value of practically giving it away for free.
Then there is hard plastic all around, and even with 16k km on the clock some parts are already rattling. Then ridiculously wide door footstep that you have to go over to get in the car. Infotainment (despite the physical buttons) is the most stupid unit I used! It even can't remember that you were listening BT last time you drove so each time it switches to radio when you start the car.
Oh, yes, the start button... It is the most unresponsive start button ever. You have to hold it for a second or more so that it figures out you want to turn on or off the car.
Back seat is far more worse than described in this video. Rear windows come half way down even though they are tiny. Hard plastic everywhere, even on doors elbow support.  You really have to crawl in on the rear seat and then you feel like in the dungeon. No light in rear bench. 
Rear camera image on the screen is horrible. 
Suspension is hard and unforgiving, very loud and shakes entire chassis even on the smallest pothole. Steering wheel is disconnected from the feeling of driving, driving display is just huge display with not so much useful info.
AC controls are mainly integrated into infotainment and very confusing
These SUVs are becoming popular only because people's vanity. They are pointles for the fuel efficiency and practicality, they are not capable of offroading, horrible to drive on road, and these downsized engines are not even remotely better than 4 cylinder in real life usage, and their lifespan is much shorter. But they are cheaper for the manufacturers...",2024-01-24T09:40:37Z

If you drive it in normal mode it takes forever to pick up speed.  In sport mode there's quite a lot between hitting the gas pedal and the car noticing this, then it's rushing and you have to hit the brakes. This in city traffic , so getting through a junction  of roundabout is a nerve wracking expetience.  The seat adjustments are limited making it uncomfortable.  The car feels unstable, the brakes don't give you any confidence.  Fortunately I'm only stuck with this for a couple of days and will thereafter absolutely avoid it.",2023-06-16T22:44:27Z

2022-06-19T08:39:55Z,@richardharrison3099,RRf_qR2EzTs,So we have had a petrol automatic Mokka for 12 months. So the lane control is a pain. Getting in the back is another issue. So kids will be ok but if your an adult you will have issues getting in and out. We have the keyless entry. We have given up on this as it is so temperamental. Then one big issue is when we go to open the car with the key fob. We find the car will not open. The key fob stops working. So we have a trick now to get round this. We have to open and close the boot. Which I am guessing because we have keyless entry it allows us to do this. Then the key fob comes back to life. We can now open the car with the key fob. The car has been back 7 times to the dealer. Still not fixed.,2022-06-19T08:39:55Z

2021-02-06T14:47:23Z,@errcoche,2_B_KUtDWGA,"So I just realized that we have this here in the US - the petrol variant - badged as a Chevy Trax and there is a Buick variant ( my neighbour has one ).
They do strike me as a stupid design because the cabin looks tiny in relation to the size of the vehicle in terms of the four corners. As an electric car, the design makes more sense with the car being taller because it is sitting on a tray of batteries. Of course, there is no electric option here.

They have the Bolt here and I am a little surprised that they haven't brought out an SUV based on the Bolt chassis. It's a tall hatchback so it would just need a little dressing up to become a faux SUV. The cabin in the Bolt ( I just bought one ) is woeful compared to the Mokka. It has the worst seats of any car I have owned and yet is the most expensive car I have owned albeit that I bought it used and for a very reasonable $15k. Still, I love it overall.

Best Vauxhall IMHO, Mark III Cavalier. I had a 2.0 CD in the early 90s - a company car, as was every other example and they were like a plague on the motorways of Britain. I could do an indicated 90 at 3,000 RPM and it just ate up miles. Loved that car. It did for Ford at the time. It was disparaged in general as the rep-mobile but there was a reason all the fleet buyers chose it.",2021-02-06T14:48:42Z

They say 201 mile range...in real world use that will be closer to 150 miles....which is pretty dreadful.
Anyone who's thinking of paying ¬£34k ought to save up and buy a ¬£40k Tesla ... they'd have a *Real* electric car then complete with an established charging infrastructure.

2021-02-07T15:11:01Z,@Brian-om2hh,2_B_KUtDWGA,"EV's are premium priced at the momsent because they're relatively new tech to the market, but like computers and digital cameras, prices will ease. The cost of lithium batteries has tumbled in the last 10 years. And once more people buy into the technology, then manufacturing costs come down. But yes, at the moment EV's are pricey Steve, but the cost of running them is a *lot* less than a petrol or diesel car. Prior to getting my Kia eNiro, I was forking out about ¬£25 to ¬£30 a week for fuel. Now it's around ¬£7 a week. I charge at home on my drive using cheap rate through the night, usually once every 8 or 9 days. Servicing costs are peanuts in comparison too, as there are no oil changes, no engine, no cooling system, no gearbox, no clutch, no exhaust etc..",2021-02-07T15:13:36Z
