AXGNb76QgH0,NEW Fiat 600E Review: Fantastic or Flawed? | 4K,AutoTrader,foreign 500e and you should it's brilliant but for you it was just on the small side then this might be just the thing you need because this is the new Fiat 600e which is basically the 500e but it's bigger chunkier and yeah looks like an SUV that's the simple way of looking at the Fiat 600e and it'll be enough to get most people interested SUVs are super trendy these days of course but there's a lot more going on Under the Skin firstly it's not actually a chunky 500e  technically it's basically a Jeep Avenger and built in the same Factory in Poland and it uses Parts also found in the Vauxhall Market e and the Peugeot e 2008 among a few more so it's a bit French a bit American a bit polish and with some Italians sprinkled on top but what does that matter when it looks like this all the things that make the 500e look cool and cute are here but it does look a bit meaner than the 500e large model name in the center true Fiat style rather than the manufacturer badge but I don't know I'm still not sure about these eyelids Jerry's out for me on those now feet have done a very good job of basically making it look like a chubby 500e nice big wheels up to 18 inch to keep it all in proportion what's interesting are the color options Sophia have apparently banned Gray even though it's the UK's most popular car color bulb move Fiat instead you get uniquely Italian takes on four particular themes C sun sky and Earth but the Earth color is called sand and I don't know what you think but to me doesn't it look quite gray maybe not so bold after all fit and then around the back a very familiar slope very 500-esque and what's interesting is the boot size 360 liters that's double the size of the Fiat 500 and apparently the biggest in class so says Fiat and it does have some useful features but the suspension covers at the side are quite intrusive and you'll actually find a lot more space in a Kia Nero EV or a Peugeot e 2008 fiance this has 15 liters of front storage which apparently is best in class but maybe someone forgot to tell them that the Jeep Avenger which is basically made on the same production line by basically the same company has 34. anyway a cool Central Storage cubby which has this nice looking iPad cover but I might get a little irritating three cup holders um decent sized door bins and a rather large glove box it also has wireless charging and one two three USB ports which is all well and good apart from the kids in the back might have to fight over who uses that one USB at least they won't fight about who uses the rear door Pockets though because there aren't any but a baffling oversight there are buckets on the back of the chairs for phones or books but it'd be nice to have a central armrest with cup holders in for me leg room is sufficient but if they're at all a driver then perhaps that would start to feel a little squished Headroom definitely sufficient isofix on both sides considering it's the same height as the 500e feels good pretty spacious beyond all that it's just really stylish in here the dashboard is lifted from the 500 quite literally and it looks lovely including the integrated LED lighting the touchscreen is fairly straightforward to use and there are shortcut buttons for the main functions so you're not fiddling around in menus too much which is a good job because the software design is quite busy the main question though does it drive as well as Fiat says it does right where's the exit we can't keep going around here all night we're told it has a beautiful joyful pampered Driving Experience Big Talk pampered I'd say overall yes the first thing he notices how quiet it is I mean obviously electric cars tend to be a lot quieter because you don't have the internal combustion sounds but then usually you end up hearing an awful lot of tire and wind noise but actually fiat's done a really good job of shutting that sound out suspension is on the softer side too soaks up the bumps well and body control feels pretty good when you turn sharply in a corner it doesn't feel like the Leaning Tower of Pisa so you might worry that it doesn't have the same frisky character as the Fiat 500 the sense that it's small Nimble and fun especially given that it's an SUV and it uses so many bits of other cars but you shouldn't worry you can feel the 500 in here the steering is really light but it turns the car quite sharply and that means at higher speeds it feels kind of alert and alive but around town also dead easy to maneuver kind of effortless unlike the Fiat 500 which can feel a bit cramped this feels a lot less claustrophobic visibility is good too it's a nice driving position and you've got really good view of the road ahead plus you can pretty much see all four corners of the car the 600e has a single electric motor driving the front wheels but the power you get depends on which of the three driving modes the car's in in normal mode it has 109 horsepower but an Eco that drops to just 82 to make the battery last longer and in sport it leaps up to 154 driving modes in cars like this often don't make much difference but in here they really do whichever mode you're in this is not the fastest of cars not 62 in nine seconds but if you're a speed demon or you like to regularly overtake then pop it in sport mode because it does make a massive difference certainly feels an awful lot snappier the 600e comes with a 54 kilowatt hour battery which is good for about 249 miles or 372 if you're just pootling around town some of its Rivals like the Kia Nero or the Volvo ex30 do have bigger batteries but it does charge pretty quickly at up to 100 kilowatts so that's good for not 80 in about half an hour the 33 000 pounds base model called red doesn't have navigation it also comes with steel wheels under plastic covers ugh you'll need a top level Prima model for your big Alloys and your Sat Nav which is 37 000 pounds it also comes with keyless entry a massaging driver's seat fully adaptive cruise control including automatic stop and go in traffic and even a hands-free tailgate loads of stuff basically but still no rear door pockets or gray paint never gray paint unless you go for sand which is definitely not gray anyway at least they're trying to encourage people to make bold color choices and that sums up the 600e pretty nicely there's just something about it that's more fun more joyful if you like than the average small crossover and if that doesn't convince you the price just might remember at 33 000 pounds is nearly four grand cheaper than a Kia e Nero and Peugeot e 2008 and almost 6 000 pounds less than a Vauxhall Moka e and that combination of price personality and practicality is what makes the 600e here so appealing it's an affordable electric crossover that you'll buy because you want to not just because you need the space I like it it's a shame it's not a bit quicker although sport mode is quite fun the space in the back is not huge and boot space while it's okay it could be a problem if you had a large family but that's just the thing isn't it with these crossover types but all in all yeah if you're looking for a grown-up car but you're not quite ready to be a grown-up then this could be just the car for you [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you [Music]
MvgfB8kcS1s,I wasn't expecting to like THIS car so much?! Fiat 600e review UK 4K,Auto Social UK,"fats have always had this fabulous way of winning you over I never thought I was going to be a fat 500 girl but then I spent time with a f 500 electric and I also owned an arbar 595 for around a year and quickly they're fun and quirky and quite often compromised personalities just made me fall in love but have they been able to inject that fat passion into their latest larger electric product this is the Fiat 600e and in today's video we're going to be finding out if it's Love at First fat or if I'm going to be dumping it at the end of this video plus I'll be giving you all the facts and figures that you need to know if you're considering this as your next car so if that sounds good then please keep watching and if you like new car reviews and car content well you're in the right place please go ahead and hit the Subscribe button so before we talk about that quirky fat styling let me tell you all the important facts and figures around the electric bits it's fitted with a 54 KW battery capable of covering a claimed 250 Mi on a single charge the 154 PS electric motor has proven credentials and provides the power to allow the Fiat to accelerate from not to 62 mph in 9 seconds before reaching top speeds of 93 mph prices start from a reasonable 32995 however fat are offering the egant to give you £3,000 pound towards the purchase price then making it one of the cheapest electric SUVs on the market if you're not bothered about the electric stuff there is also a 1.2 L petrol mild hybrid version with 100 brake horsepower that cuts the price to just 23, 975 yes a whopping £99,000 less the fat 600e has a maximum charging speed of 100 KW so that's slightly behind some Rivals but still if you find a charger quick enough then you can go from not to 80% in around half an hour if you've got an at home wbox like I have now this will charge at 7 KW and it will take you around 8 hours for a full charge at first glance you might think the new car is just a fancy replacement for the firm's 500x crossover but it's not so the 500 x has still got a couple more years in it yet this 600 is a bit smaller and lower sliding right under the 500 x in the fiat's lineup it's like the bigger four-door sibling to the 500 just like the good old 600 from the 1950s fat have done a good job of beefing up the appearance of The Lovable 500e even if the design below and above the number plate make it look a bit like they've added a mustache and a goatee to its baby brother the classic theat styling of the rounder motive headlamps and the Funky flower designed alloy wheels help to play homage to the brand and the floating 600 beside the lights is a nice touch electric cars come in two trim levels Lea and red red models have the choice of three colors and it will come as no surprise that one of those is red the interior also features black seats with red embroidered stitching and a red dashboard insert the lur Prima models are for those who are looking to go a bit more daring with their colors all four of the colors are inspired by elements of the Italian landscape the one I have named orange Sun of Italy Blue Sky of Italy Green Sea of Italy and sand Earth of Italy all a prima models get a light interior lastly opting for the hybrid only trim means that you get all of these colors paired together with black and ivory fabric seats around the back they're once again leaning into their Italian Heritage and you'll find the Italian flag just down here in the embossed 600 it's a pretty nice rear design not as nice as the front you do get some 3D tail lights but I don't quite like them as much as the emotive front lights you also get a nice gloss black spoiler which I do think is a nice addition now inside this boot you'll get 360 L of space you also get an electric boot which I found really handy now 360 isn't the biggest of its Rivals but actually I find it more than practical I've been moving house this week and it's been taking all of my stuff for the house move so it's been easily a very practical car you've got a nice load area as you can see it's nice and kind of waist length to load things in and it will easily fit quite a few suitcases and you even have some underfloor storage where you're able to pop your charging cables moving on to the interior of the 600e and I think that Fiat have done a pretty good job at bringing the personality of the 500 into this larger electric product it feels very quintessentially fat however there's still no denying the fact that this does just feel a little bit like a rebranded product from either perso or voxel around the cabin you will find things like this the start stop button which are familiar throughout every one of those products although fear have done a good job at bringing their own personality especially to these wonderful seats I really like these I know that may be contrasting and some people may find the light Fabric or light leather a little bit impractical but I think they look great and they match the personality although I would definitely want to go for one of the greens or Blues to match with this lovely light blue greeny stitching here and you also have fat all the way down the center I just think these are really nice I also love the armrest this can also be extended which is quite nice and then you have this slightly strange storage area now this can be customized using these little bits of plastic so you can have extra cup holders or you can take them out so that you have just an open storage area but I don't know I've always found these little bits of plastic a little bit cheap personally I'd rather just have some standard cup holders as you always need cup holders now here you have some additional storage and you'll see that it's behind this slightly strange how I would describe iPad cover so this is actually magnetic and it kind of folds up so that you can customize that storage there and you can also take it completely out as well although I don't think that looks particularly nice I'm not really sure how I feel about this I feel like it feels a little bit cheap they've done this in the Jeep advenger as well and I would have rather they'd gone for a more high quality coverage rather than this little bit of lever although I'm sure some people are going to love it now inside of here you will find your USB and USBC charger as well as a 12vt charging point so lots of charging options and if those still aren't enough you also have some wireless charging in the center as well which is really handy Above This storage section you also have a little snack drawer where they pop very nicely or of course when you're not wirelessly charging your phone that will fit in there as well it's just a nice storage option to have the layout is very good as well it's all very easy to see you've got a nice clear screen although I would say that this screen feels a little bit small compared to some other rival products however despite the touchscreen being slightly on the smaller side compared to some Rivals I find the functionality very simple and one of the main reasons why the functionality is so good is because of physical buttons in this center console you've got three and four if you can the hazard light physical buttons hazards you've got your door locks you've got a car here which gives you a shortcut to all of your different safety systems and then you have the home button which takes you straight back to the home screen for instance if you're using your Apple carplay which is Wireless you can then just press home and that takes you back to the main home screen which is really simple as you can see on the left hand side your climate control dials stay here on your home screen how ever you don't really need them because you've got everything you need right here you've got dials which you can click up and down to change the temperature as well as automatic AC Max AC and off as well as your fan speed as well here on the right now the only disappointing thing is there's no Dual Zone climate control so you can't change it between you and your passenger but I really like that you have all of these physical buttons now if you wanted to access your heated seats for for instance you have a menu button in the middle here and then that will give you a quick function to be able to angle your fan speed and to also go on to seat options and change your heated seats but if that's a few too many shortcuts then what you can do is on your home screen you can just pull down and your heated seats stay there at all times and you've also got your Apple carplay as well and you can change some other shortcuts to be here at the swipe down menu so it's really easy to find your favorite different functions when you swipe across the screen you'll see your map and then swipe again and then you've got loads of different functions including things like your energy consumption as well as lots of other features there's plenty of things to play around with and you have all of your modern-day technology with electric meaning that you can set your climate control before you start your journey when it's connected overnight which I think is really handy jumping into the back of the 600e you are reminded of the fact that though it is larger than the 500e it's definitely not the biggest family car as you can see this is in my driving position and I don't have the most leg room so six foot people would struggle although there's quite a lot of head space I'm impressed with that you do get some USBC charging which is in this armrest which unfortunately does come quite far back and you don't get any cup holders in the center or an armrest which is a shame you also don't get any storage in the doors either so it's not exactly the most practical in the back here that's a little bit disappointing but things that I do like you still get this really high quality lever you've got the same stitching which feels really nice it's also nice and light because you've got a light headlining so despite being a little bit smaller it still doesn't feel claustrophobic I also like the fact that both of your is fixed fitments in the back here are behind Zips so that's going to keep things nice and tidy and it also just feels a little bit more premium you do also have door pockets on both the backs of the seats but you really do have a compromised middle seating position because this sits on the same platform to accommodate non-el electric vehicles that means that you still have a transmission tunnel so if I slide across to the middle one you have to get your leg behind that Center armrest and then you have to sit either side of the transmission tunnel and as you can see there that doesn't leave you much space either side for people sitting to the size of you so really if you are going to use this car it's only really a four- seater five if you absolutely have to so the last piece of the puzzle is to take the 600e out for a spin and tell you about the Driving Experience I'm not particularly a fan of these little buttons for selecting the gears but let's face it those really are minor things so we'll just quickly put it in drive and I'm actually going to put it straight into my braking mode as well because unfortunately that does stop every single time and even if you go to park or if you go to reverse if you go back into drive it turns it off which I find a little bit annoying but we'll put it back into braking mode and I'm just going to make sure that I'm in the normal driving mode for now there's three different modes you've got economy normal and Sport as well but going to sit it in normal because I think really that's where fat 600e drivers are going to have it most of the time and overall I found it a really Pleasant Driving Experience they seem to have got the balance for this car very very good you see it's quite engaging you've got not the lightest steering but it is actually quite nice to drive there's not too much roll in the corners the throttle response is good but it's not too sharp so that means that when you're pulling away the wheels don't Spin and it doesn't throw you back in your seat it's actually quite a smooth power delivery of course if you want a sharper power delivery you can pop it in sport and then it will become a bit more responsive and of course the opposite to that when it's in Eco that then dulls down your throttle response and really it does become very dull at that point so I think you're going to want to have it in normal most of the time and it does have that theat personality about it with the steering you see the steering is quite light and that means it's really easy to maneuver around town and you do lose a little bit of kind of the engagement when you're on the back roads because it's not exactly thrilling to drive because you do feel the steering is just a bit too light so if you throw it around you don't always have the best control over the vehicle but then that wasn't designed to be like that it was designed to be a fat 500 or a fat 600 and have that theat personality and the personality of the fear has always been that it's a fantastic City car and for that I think they've got it nailed and despite of course being a much larger vehicle than the 500 it still feels really easy to maneuver it doesn't feel like a large car and of course on this model I have got the rear view camera so it's easy to park as well and you've got pretty good visibility it's quite a small rear window but actually elsewhere around the car it's a decent amount of visibility nice visibility over the Bonnet and I'm actually sitting down quite low so if I was to go up a bit higher I can then see over the full Bonnet which I know for a lot of people is a plus point so that means you can always see exactly how close you are to things in front of you overall I don't really have any complaints about the drive of this car other than the regenerative braking so there's only one level of regenerative braking and that can be found via the button next to the drive button and it's not exactly a one pedal drive if that's what you like so we'll accelerate and then just come off of the accelerator and as you can see this is with the regenerative breaking and it's not even going to break me in time for my corner so we're going to go around the corner still off of the throttle and now we're coming to a crawl so it does take a while to slow down I really like regenerative breaking and I like it to be as strong as possible because I like a one pedal drive so if that's what you're after then maybe the 600e isn't going to be the vehicle for you but if you're not too fussed about that regenerative braking then elsewhere everything is really nice about the car and I also love the fact that you have a shortcut underneath the screen which has a little car on it press that and it instantly takes you to your lane keeping assist and you can also kind of favorite some things on here so if there's other things you want to turn off on the Safety Systems then you can get there really really quickly but I actually haven't found the lane assist to be that intrusive I've actually found it to be quite well balanced so I really don't think you'd need to turn it off but if it's something you really dislike then you have that really quick shortcut it's all just really easy to use and it's not particularly exciting to drive but then it didn't need to be thing which I've always found it a little bit difficult to trust stellantis regarding is efficiency and what do I I mean by that well you see their early electric cars like the Corsa e or the Perse e208 they were not particularly efficient they were supposed to do around 200 miles on a full charge and in reality and especially in Winter they were only getting around 100 miles and this was due to poor thermal efficiency and also they were running on some poor efficiency tires as well but over time stanus have made changes to these cars and those original cars then got 220 Mi of claimed range and they were achieving much closer to 180 they were far better after they made those changes and now you have these new generation of cars the slightly larger ones you've got this the 600e the Jeep Avenger electric you've also got the new perso e208 and they claim closer to 250 mil but can they achieve that well I'm really pleased to say that with dramatic Paws I really think they have now made the right changes to be able to achieve these figures you see when I've been spending time with this the 600e I've seen in upwards of 5 m per kilowatt hour that's really impressive if you know your electric cars you'll know that that's pretty much as good as it gets that is the ultimate EV Driving Experience though because I've been doing drives a little bit in warmer climat so it's been around 15° and also I've been doing shorter Journeys and at lower speed so around 30 mph and that's the ultimate EV Driving Experience but still I'm really impressed with that efficiency and on that claimed efficiency it should be able to do the claimed 250 miles but what about when you get out on the motorway or when it's a little bit colder well I've done that as well and I've seen around 4.1 miles per kilowatt hour which is really quite good of course that is going to be a slight drop but you do expect that when you're doing those Motorway miles and that's probably going to see around 200 to 220 mil but this is still really impressive and I think that's right on the money for the target audience of this car I think that most people should be easily able to run a car on 220 M I appreciate that other than the complaint about the slight lack of strength to the regenerative braking and the weird quality of that interior iPad cover in the center console this has been a very positive review and I do really like the Fiat 600e but would I put my money where my mouth is and actually buy one well there's some serious competition out there and there's some serious competition for more affordable Rivals I think if you can get a good enough deal on a 600e then it's a very strong option for a fun family electric car but let me know what do you think of the 600e or would you go for one of the rivals let me know which in the comments down below I really hope you have enjoyed this video today guys if you have go ahead and give it a

eZMrw98nHgU,Fiat 600e FIRST UK DRIVE. Does the 500e’s big sister have la dolce vita? | Electrifying.com,Electrifying,"I know what you're thinking Nikki's lost her mind Nicola already did a review of the fat 600e one possibly both of those statements are in fact correct however you might notice something different we're not in Italy no it's gray which means we are of course in Great Britain so this is the first time we're testing the car on the Great British road so I am here to find out if this lovely little motor has the essence of lul Vita because I think we all need a bit of sweetness in our lives without the calories but before we find out if the fat 600D does have all the ingredients but are sweet life remember subscribe to the channel thanks very much now here at electrifying we've always been huge fans of the fat 500 E its cute personality isn't just Skin Deep it's a very competent little electric car and little is the right word because while supposedly you can squeeze four people in it it's not a particularly elegant way to transport your friends and um well I mean in terms of getting car seats kids all of their stuff it ain't happening so the 600 E with its Five Doors and a more spacious interior could be the perfect answer for those who want the charm of a 500y but the space that comes with a small crossover now Fiat simply hasn't just taken the 500 and stretched it a bit they've actually gone down the far easier route of actually pinching the big bits that you can't see including the battery and the electric motor from the Jeep Avenger now that kind of sounds like cheating doesn't it but the Avenger is actually a great little electric car so the 600e has actually all the right ingredients to be a really good car now it's got all the good bits of the fat 500 uh but obviously it's a little bit bigger um it still has that kind of cutesy charm but we got to talk about the eyes what's going on and the expression actually generally is it a slightly kind of seductive smirk or is it resting face depends on your mood I think the way you look at it uh I'm going to go resting  face in this case says a lot about me doesn't it um the other thing the eyelids eyelashes eyelids slightly closed I think again it's supposed to be that kind of you know Zoolander what is that pose called the Zoolander blue steel look but I feel like they actually just look a bit Dopey like the eyes are kind of half asleep like a kind of half asleep Angry Bird 10 out of 10 for this the mascara flick that I can never get the right angle on so whoever did that if you come do my makeup that would be Fab um 50 cm longer than the 500 50 cm well used I would say it's got presents doesn't it this car um it's still compact got presents but it's not too much of a handful unlike some people I know no now f is making a big song and dance about the color with the 600 apparently it's embracing its dolita Spirit by ditching gray H too many car makers paint their cars in boring Shades believes Fiat and that's why you can now choose from some very bright colors come with rather fancy names too so orange is called the son of Italy but I thought the sun was yellow anyway the sort of greeny blue color is the sky of Italy again I thought the sky was like a pale blue anyway the Sea of Italy is a Bluey greeny color too and then there's the Earth of Italy which is well actually it's kind of gray I'm so confused here is a little known fact for you now the CM 500 that we all know and absolutely adore was of course that original car that put families on the road it put Italy on the map when it came to cars and it spread like wildfire around the world we absolutely loved it and we fell in love with the model however 2 years previously the 600 was born so actually the 600 was the Forerunner to the 500 and I think most people think it's the other way around this is what US Brits like to call the boot and there is 360 L of the stuff which means it's kind of small um it's actually smaller than the VW ID3 it's smaller than the mg4 however it has a variable floor if you get La Prima version daada I like to call it the hidden floor because you can hide things in there like treats or charging cables what else can I show you oh I know the seats they fold in a 46 60 fashion which is always handy when you need to put loads of cargo in the car uh oh this is just a reminder 600 the model you're driving and of course at the touch of a button your boot closes I do like that and just in case you have forgotten again there's the 600 with the Italian flag to remind you that this is the fat 600e okay well back here I was hoping I'd have a bit more space but it's still a bit claustrophobic definitely bigger than the 500 that's for sure um but well you can see where the seat position is and how much space there is between my knees and the front seat I'm actually running a Vox or mocka e at the moment and I would say that's slightly bigger in the back I mean as you can see this opening is quite narrow um and if you're trying to get car seats in kids it's going to be a battle I mean I mean it's always a battle putting kids in a car seat but uh putting their mood and Tantrums to one side it's still going to be a bit tough but once they're in they're not going anywhere um other thing to note back here is you've got a lovely little USB C Port which is very useful however it only comes in the top spec um but other than that it's a nice place to be it feels expensive for quite a affordable car um and I do quite like if you see the stitching on the seats back here it does say f it which you might think is a bit too much brand in your face but the way they've done the stitching it's kind of subtle and it it looks it looks kind of cool I like it it's more like a pattern but if you look closely it says theet well that is the rear space probably the last time I'm going to sit in this position to be honest time for the front that was clever wasn't it now if you look quite hard um the bottom part of this Dash you will notice it looks a bit like the Jeep Avenger um and that is because bits have just been pinched from the Jeep Avenger um whether that was a good idea or not I'm not 100% sure I mean down here is where your drive selector is it's an all right place for I suppose this funny little cubby iPad cover I I just don't understand um has also been stolen from the Avenger which definitely should have stayed the rest of it though you can tell it's been inspired by the fat 500 because it does have that retro feeling about it I love this Ivory finish up here now this is La Prima version topspec version therefore you get it in Ivory if you go for the entry level red this part will actually be the same color as the body paint um which is quite nice but I prefer it in Ivory um up front here we've got your lovely digital display right in front of the driver position got all the information you should hope for infotainment system nice and easy to use now you only get SAA on the top spec car but let's be honest who uses that luckily Wireless Apple carplay and Android auto are standard on all the models so just stick with that physical buttons which I used to really like but my view is now changing very useful I think to have all of the the stuff that you need straight away with no distractions of having to go into various menus at your fingertips however what I do quite like is if it's just at the bottom of the screen at all times that would be my preference but um anyway this is what you've got physical buttons um and yeah all in all I think it does feel quite elegant a bit retro a little bit PL iy at times but for the price point it's kind of what you would expect there's just one motor battery option the 600e and no surprises here it's the same as you'll find on a whole host of stellantis electric cars so that means a 54 kilowatt hour battery or 51 KW usable and a 154 brake horsepower motor which drives the front wheel this is good for a range of up to 254 m in the cheaper red model or 252 mi in La Prima we first tested the 600e last summer in a sizzling Italy on a mixture of roads and we actually averaged around 220 mil now in a colder UK in the winter we've actually been getting closer to 200 miles fat does throw in a heat pump of sandard though which should help in those cooler temperatures right this is the important bit how does it drive and well I can tell you straight away it's quite different from the 500 I think this is where we really see the differences um because the 500 is kind of like nippy and agile bit like a little Terrier darting around all the time whereas this it feels it's a bit more refined it's a bit more grownup which I suppose is what you would expect from more of a family car it's a bit more black laab like um I don't know why I'm using dog analogies cuz they've really got nothing to do with dog but there you go now in terms of handling steering is quite light I feel a bit disconnected to the road it's okay but just a little lighter than I would like um that kind of goes for the braking as well you really have to kind of thump on the brake pedal to stop what I do like is you've got the B button for the regen now that is the mode that I just have it on permanently because it means I don't have to use the brake pedal as much however we will test this I'll use it a little bit but it doesn't actually come to a complete standstill no um so it's just sort of slows you down now this has 154 brake horsepower woohoo um and it has enough not loads and you do feel like it struggles a little bit if you're trying to overtake on the motorway but um yeah it's going to be absolutely fine for kind of driving around town and going at a very moderate speed on the motorway I've got to say though the ride is pretty good you can hear the suspension thump into the potholes luckily not so many around here compared to in Italy but it doesn't actually translate into an uncomfortable ride it is relatively smooth now in the press conference before they gave me the keys to this Fiat said that apparently according to them 66% British people thought that living an Italian lifestyle would make them happier does it make make me happier o what have we got here an Italian Suite oh it's chocolate nuts in now I'm happier I can confirm living the Italian lifestyle does make me [Music] happier now the doich lifestyle is all very well but ultimately how much is it going to cost us and there is no nothing sweeter in life than a bargain now when we first drove this in Italy we were hoping for a price point around the 30,000 Mark and now we know the figures are in bear with me it's a little bit disappointing to start with but wait for it so the entry level the red model is coming in at 32,9 195 La Prima is four grand more 36 995 but fat have said that for at least the rest of 20124 they are committed to this that anyone that buys a fat 600e will get £3,000 off the list price they basically said they're pretty angry at the government for originally offering all of us incentives to buy electric cars and then the government slly took it away so feia have said don't worry guys if the government can't do it we know they're going to let us down at some point as they always do we will do it for you so they are offering £3,000 off the list price which means the entry level is under 30 grand just by5 but still it's under 30k right okay let's conclude this drive of the Fiat 600e now if you did fall in love with the Fiat 500 and love that cutesy character but it was just limiting you on the size and the practicality well then this could be for you because it is a bit bigger it is a bit more practical and it drives a little bit better is this lulita wrapped up in a car well honestly I think you're going to have to have quite a good imagination and some good Italian food on hand [Music] and well hopefully we've sprinkled a bit of DOL Vite over you and your happiness level has skyrocketed to 10 out of 10 if it has would you do us a favor subscribe to the channel cheers"
HAZC8wrWQGM,All-new 600e Review: Fiat's family friendly EV,CarGurus UK,the Fiat 600e is the latest electric car from the Italian brand it shares a platform on a Powertrain with the Jeep Avenger a sister brand from the stalantis group meaning a range of up to 254 miles for this pure electric High riding family hatchback with prices starting at just under 33 000 pounds now we really like the Jeep Avenger not least because it is actually a properly compact car that's one of the things that I think you know it's a quite a small car yet it's got a decent range and the Fiat 600e is much the same so for the Fiat you're looking at 4.17 meters long which for some context is sort of between a Volkswagen Polo and golf in length so it really is kind of a usefully compact City car yet it is also more than kind of big enough and mature enough if you want to do high mileage with it if you're going on the motorway routinely it is what I think Fiat would probably call a B plus so it's good in that respect because it's not huge so many modern cars are getting a bit big aren't they and I think the fact that the Fiat and the Jeep sort of buck that trend is good now you'll have to forgive me we're out on the international launch but we don't have a huge amount of time with the car so this may not be quite up to scratch with our normal CarGurus reviews but hopefully it'll give you a good idea of what to expect with a Fiat 600D which after all is quite a big model lots of people out there are looking for a car that's not too big reasonably priced a decent range take the boxes for a lot of people because it looks cool and it's really nice to drive we're out in Sharon around the company it's very historic Mira Fury Factory this car is actually made in Poland but nonetheless Fiat have very very deep roots here in Turin so they wanted to show us their lovely Factory and this is where we're driving the car and I can't blame for it for really pushing home the Italian point I mean you know you've got the Italian badge on the bumper you the colors are called things like Sun by Italy and uh you know Sand by Italy which absolutely isn't gray by the way you know Fiat said they're not doing great cars anymore I would say that sand by it and he looks quite gray but gloss over that the dash is also rather striking with a painted finish to match the car even in the 600e red which is the cheaper of the two Trims on offer a 10 inch color touchscreen with Wireless Apple carplay and Android auto is standard too and there's plenty of room in the back seats for two average size adults or for a couple of kids but three will be a bit of a push a 360 liter boot will be fine for most everyday family duties although it is annoying that you have to go for top spec La Prima to get a variable boot floor but it is a big price jump up it's something that over four thousand pounds more than the uh cheaper red Fiat 600a anyway even that's reasonably well equipped you get your reversing sensors um you get the 10 inch touchscreen here the Uconnect system which we've seen on quite a few other stellantis cars now as well it's pretty good the graphics are good it's reasonably easy to use a wireless Apple carplay and Android auto I actually think it does a pretty good job driving wise definitely Comfort oriented the steering's really light but it does the job I do think you could do with more feedback I think if you're comparing this to say the 2008 and the Jeep Avenger which a lot of people will be it feels agile enough actually on some of the faster roads around here in Italy it's been really quite good fun but you don't get a huge amount of feedback through the steering wheel it's absolutely fine for what you want it to do 10 and a half meter turning Circle so it's reasonably nippy and wieldy around town I think it just does exactly what you want it to do it's not massively fast 9 seconds to 62. uh front wheel drive of course you've got that single electric motor up front and you have a 51 kilowatt hour usable battery for an official wltp of 254 miles all in I think the Fiat 600e has got a lot going for it I think that basic sort of sub 33 000 pound price would be quite tempting to a lot of people the monthly prices in the UK are going to be really critical if they can get those down and keep deposits and APR down and that kind of thing then I think a lot of people will go for it because it really is a nice blend I think of being both really convenient for things like the school run and nipping to the shops because it's quite Compact and yeah it feels comfy and sort of substantial enough to also do the family trips at the weekend further up the motorway to see family and that kind of thing as for Real World Range we saw 4.3 miles per kilowatt hour on our varied summer route on the roads around Turin for the 600e international launch that's good for a range of 220 miles while we would expect to see that drop to around 180 miles in winter with the standard heat pump helping with winter efficiency I like it I really do like it I think perhaps the Jeep's got a bit more gumption to it style wise I don't know maybe the sort of cheerfulness and the slickness and the italian-ness of the 600D will win people over I do think that longer range cars like the mg4 even arguably when you look at things like the ID3 which is quite a bit bigger it has got a lot of competition this car so you've got to specifically have to want a car that's not too big and that has that sort of style Focus I think to choose this over some of those Rivals even so it's a well-rounded product it's got a lot going for it and I do genuinely really like it and that is the new Fiat 600e don't forget to head to cargurus.co.uk for a whole host of

Z6vFfBmTXuA,Is this car a bit *too* quirky? Fiat 600e Review,Electroheads,hello Electro heads Tish here and welcome back to the channel now if you're after a small electric crossover from the stalantis group well you're spoiled for Choice pretty much every single manufacturer now has one in their lineup and Fiat wasn't about to miss out introducing the all-new Fiat 600e but what makes this car different from the rest of the cars that are currently out there after all they all share the same battery and running gear there isn't much difference between them so why choose the Fiat or hopefully that's what I'm going to get to the bottom of in today's video so if that sounds good then please keep watching and if you like electric car content and Electric Mobility then this is the place to be if you're looking for a car that's going to blend in amongst the Sea of monochrome Motors then you're out of luck here but for those of us who like to look on the brighter side of life the 600e will only be available in a cheery color palette inspired by the beauty of Italy that includes Hues of suns of Italy Seas of Italy Earth of Italy and skies of Italy Fiat had the vision of transforming the design and personality of the Fiat 500 electric city car into a larger more practical package that would better cater for family needs with the 600e to simplify the task the company utilized the platform motor battery pack and interior technology of the 600e from the stalantis parts bin consequently it shares many features with the newly launched Jeep Avenger in fact they're now built alongside one another in the factory in tinchi Poland design while this is possibly something which is more important to Fiat than well anything really you buy a Fiat because of the design you don't buy them because of the power you don't buy them because of the ride comfort you buy them because they're quirky and cool and you can absolutely tell that that's what they've gone with with the new 600e do I like it no I don't think I do it does borderline just on a bit too quirky for me they've given it this big grin at the bottom and they've given it these emotive headlights with the eyebrows at the top but for me personally I don't think it's a particularly stylish looking car but that's all down to personal perception because if you want something which is gonna stand out it's gonna be quirky it's gonna have that kind of personality then this is going to be an excellent choice as I mentioned you've got the grill at the bottom which almost creates this smile with the Fiat 600 and then you've got this kind of strange Grill in the middle I'm not really sure what the purpose of this is and I think maybe that's what's throwing off the exterior design for me personally I really like the badging and I like the badging around the car as well you've got this 600e at the front here in Chrome and you can also find it in some of the lights around the back and you've also got it in the side of the light there the wheels are very quirky as well I like that they've gone for that retro style it almost looks a little bit like a flower what worries me nowadays with electric Wheels is how are these going to last manufacturers nowadays are going for these really busy two-tone designs and it does concern me that if you look at Citron wheels from around five years ago you'll struggle to find one that's not corroded so is that a trend that we're going to start to see on cars in five ten years time we'll have to wait and see the headline stats for the 600e are as follows a 54 kilowatt hour battery and a standard heat pump help to achieve 250 miles of electric range a 156 brake horsepower electric motor propels the fear to 60 miles per hour in 9 seconds it could also charge at maximum speeds of 100 kilowatts whilst isn't the most impressive amongst its Rivals will still top up the battery from 20 to 80 percent in less than half an hour the interior of the 600e is a delightful throwback to fiat's Rich Heritage with numerous nods to its iconic predecessor the dashboard design and petite instrument panel pay homage the original 600 while the seats feature a tasteful stitched company logo even the steering wheel serves as a tribute to the classic 600. quality might be lacking but it's all quite pleasingly cheery fear offers two trim levels for the 600e the entry-level red option starts at 32.995 and includes 16-inch steel wheels gloss Black Wing mirror caps matte side skirts automatic climb control rear parking sensors keyless go and LED lights it also features unique red logos a red Dash and red accents on the upholstery the higher end La Prima option starts at 36.995 that adds 18 inch diamond cut alloy wheels Chrome assets and an ivory Dash a rear camera heated leather seats with a massage function for the driver a hands-free tailgate and Wireless smartphone charging both trims come with a seven inch driver's display with a 10.25 inch infotainment screen with Wireless Apple carplay and Android auto but lipoma also includes integrated navigation and an upgraded sound system around the back I feel like the design is slightly more palatable than the front it's not quite as daring and I quite like a few of the design cues around here you've got a nice contrasting black spoiler I really like the lights as well very similar to what we're seeing on other brands products they're in this Crystal Clear design so you can see the inner workings you've got the 600 on the side and I like the way you've got this dappled Chrome effect which blends with the front of the car I also quite like the contrasting black bumper at the bottom you've got the 600 embossed in it and you've also got the Italian flag it's just a nice little touch which gives it that Italian Flair which fear is of course so well known for now whilst working on design fear have also concentrated quite hard on making this car not too large from the exterior so it's easy to drive around town but they've also worked quite hard on maximizing the interior space that you get as well so inside the boot you'll find quite a decent level of storage when it comes to boot space it falls within the average range for its class with a capacity of 360 liters it suppresses the smart hashtag one by 37 liters however it falls significantly short compared to the Kia Nero EV which offers a whopping 115 more liters of space and it's also 110 liters smaller than the mgzse EV fear not storage elsewhere is practical with lots of cubby holes up front and some decent sized door cards the little 500e has a personality which is well known for being brilliant around town it has light steering it's easy to drive but of course it's always been a little bit knocked for its range this however does have the nice characteristics of still being very good around town having very light steering but you have the practicality of that additional range 250 miles is far better than the previous generation of Fiat products and it should be easily enough for most drivers especially those that will be using this car to commute to go to school and to go to the football on the weekends it's interesting they've launched this car within the B segment and making a big song and dance about how they've returned to the B segment this had me stumped for a little while because I thought this was quite similar to the 500x although they're claiming that the two cars are very different the 500x is a little bit taller it's more or SUV like whereas this is kind of just more of a slightly beefier hatchback which is why they've launched it in that b segment personally if you're going to have a car in the B segment I'd prefer to see something which was punto sized or perhaps something that's slightly closer related to the Peugeot e308 or the voxel Astra and then I'd like something even chunkier if we're going for a c-segment car but overall I think it offers a good amount of practicality while still fitting into that trendy SUV package interestingly it actually had me a little bit stumped when we watched the press conference and Fiat claimed this as their return to the B segment which I found a little bit odd to me the B segment has always been small compact cars like the Vauxhall Corsa or the Peugeot e208 this feels much larger but maybe it's all a bit of a placebo when it comes to how tall it is it has that SUV stance that's not necessarily a bad thing because it has that trendy SUV styling and it is a bit more practical but personally I would have preferred to have seen a more compact car and then make the SUV even more practical with more space in the back and more space in the boot this kind of sits in an odd in between area when it comes to ride Comfort I had the expectation of the Jeep Avenger in my mind because that car is pretty much exactly the same as the Fiat 600e and I've driven it recently and I would say they drive very similarly they're very quiet they're very Supple it's actually a very comfortable car to drive but the steering is notably lighter and I think Fiat have done that on purpose because they've always been well known as being light City cars it has that very light steering paired together with a pretty good turning Circle that does mean that when it comes to driver engagement a little bit of that is lost because it's not as taught as some of the other models it certainly isn't as nice to drive as the Peugeot e 2008 but if you want an everyday family car which is going to be really really easy to drive jump in jump out with no trouble then I think you're going to really enjoy this car it's been interesting driving both the Jeep Avenger and the 600e so close together because it's easy to compare the two cars after all well they're pretty much the same in their range they're charging statistics and they offer a pretty well-rounded package when it comes to space and interior quality or what I would say is a little bit of a lack of interior quality but it's clear that each one does have its own personality for me personally I'd be edging towards the styling of the Jeep but if you're after something a bit retro with that fear Edge then the 600e is going to be a great option do I love it quite as much as the 500 possibly not but I do think if you're looking for that similar quirky styling in a much more well-rounded package than the 600e is going to give you a new Choice into the market and choice is always a good thing but let me know what do you think of the 600e do you think I've been a little bit harsh on its styling

VokQJrHzBR8,FIRST DRIVE: New Fiat 600e - does the 500e’s bigger brother deliver la dolce vita? | Electrifying,Electrifying,some interesting things about the Fiat 600e I mean the way it looks the historical name the price the efficiency something even more interesting did you know that in the UK the most popular car color is gray now in 2022 alone in the UK there was 415 000 gray cars sold yeah Sophia have said no was that enough we're not doing it anymore we're doing big bold colors only no more gray no that's not gray shut up that's not gray that's that's the Earth of Italy so definitely not not gray right let's talk about the design of the car essentially this is the bigger sister of the 500e because you know how the 500e is like utterly adorable like the cutest thing you've ever seen this is definitely the bigger sister the reason I say that is because well it's 50 centimeters longer and also has a couple of extra doors but check out her eyes perfect eyeliner flick she's got resting sassy face and resting big sister sassy face you know like one of those so this is the first electric Fiat to be based on other stalantis cars like the Jeep Avenger for example which actually Ginny drove last week so we'll pop a link in the description below so you can watch that video if you like but the big bits that they've taken are things like the 54 kilowatt hour battery which returns 254 miles of wltp range there is something about the team at stalantis that are just really good at making efficient cars because that's 19 more miles than the Hyundai Kona that's 37 more miles than the mg4 SC it's all very very impressive oh and yeah just in case you were wondering we are in Italy at the Fiat Factory yes this is where they film The Italian Job I know right so unlike the Avenger the Fiat might have a sort of suvish look but it's not got any off-road pretensions instead it's meant to be nippy around town and very fun to drive and generally it is look this is very much designed to be a city car it is just a nice bigger version of the 500e except yeah it's just a little bit bigger isn't it this is this is comfortable in town I mean I haven't fully been able to put my foot down in it yet but look at this look I'm basically just driving with one finger this is how you know it's a city car because the steering is so light like really really light weirdly light your most kind of don't feel connected to the car in a way the driving is almost too easy if that makes sense so at the moment we're driving on these windy lovely country roads in Italy which I do have to say are very much like our British roads quite bumpy and quite pothole so we could do a proper test to kind of see how the 600e handles it and it has been crashing into potholes quite a bit now I have heard according to Ginny that the Jeep Avenger copes with the potholes pretty well but this has been this has been a little bit crashy at times even like you know when you kind of go over a drain and you feel like that Rumble and the clunk when you go over a drain yeah you're feeling that through the cabin quite a bit quiet though that's really quiet actually there is a brand new motor inside this which is apparently 50 quieter than its predecessor so that's probably why it's quiet we do have different Drive modes right so we have sport mode which makes it a little bit faster I guess the throttle is a little bit more responsive if you will it's got 154 horsepower we'll do naught to 62 in like nine seconds perfectly adequate you don't need it to be any faster than that we then have normal mode which is when you just drive normally really just like normal stuff and then you have eco mode which kind of slows everything down a little bit and it will reduce the performance a little bit it doesn't have the sherpa mode you know the sherpa mode in the 500e I don't know if you've heard about this but when you put it in Sherpa mode that is when you're at the point where you're starting to panic about the mileage that you've got in your car so you put it in Sherpa mode and it just switches everything off like all the aircon and stuff and gives you a speed limit of like 50 mile an hour or something silly to make sure that you can make it to your destination to charge a car this doesn't have that this just has eco mode I guess because the battery is a little bit bigger and it will get you further than a 500e so you shouldn't have to have that worry oh by the way wonderfully efficient so we check the numbers once we did our lovely drive around Italy and we were getting 4.7 miles per kilowatt hour that's not not too shabby oh we do need to test out the regen braking so there isn't like Flappy paddles or anything like that to kind of change the levels of things instead we have the standard B button B for regen which always makes sense or B for breaking that makes sense doesn't it yeah of course so let's see how well it does when we oh okay well you could feel that couldn't you well there's no one behind me shall we see if it comes to a complete stop or a creep it might go down to a creep down to a creep okay I mean that's fine the thing is is I I do think most of us are electrifying like myself and Ginny included are big fans of regen break-in especially when you can change the levels of region like I like full-blown hearty regen breaking that I can lift my foot off the pedal and I can feel the brakes working and I'll come down to a complete stop you won't get that in this okay here is where you're really going to notice that this is definitely a city car because we're currently on the equivalent of a Motorway if you will and it is noisy road noise wind noise all of the noise that's that's not the most relaxing experience while you're driving at speed better in town welcome to the interior of the Jeep Avenger the Fiat 600e sorry sorry I mean it's an easy mistake to make because it's basically exactly the same like completely the same layout I mean if you see them side by side yeah it looks exactly the same we've got the La Prima version by the way which is the top spec version so we have all the little Ivory bits and I do have to say these seats are very comfortable I do have to give a shout out to the seats I feel like I'm sat in them rather than on them if that makes sense now The Styling in here is quite nice it's very nice and simple like the Jeep Avenger we've got a 10 and a quarter inch screen for all of your entertainment stuff on there and in a tiny little screen behind the steering wheel for all your driving information there are some sort of cheap materials dotted about where it gets a bit scratchy plasticky no gloss black though which is a really good thing I've spotted two things where I think see it have maybe just forgotten about number one is the engine start stop button engine whereas it doesn't have a an engine and this it looks nice but this Flappy is actually just a bit irritating like I'd rather just not have it I mean when it's sort of tucked back here if you kind of keep it out the way because you've got something bigger there you now can't touch any of these buttons it's like one of those sort of cheap iPad covers that you buy I'd rather just not have that at all but but storage is fantastic so they've managed to access an extra 15 liters of space of storage in here because like there is so much space inside here there's wireless phone charging there's so much space in stone here does that lift up it does look at that door bins very decent size what's going on over here that's all that's a very nice size as well storage is cracking yeah just a few little bits that need tweaking huh this is smaller than I expected um that is set up for my driving position let me tell you this for free right when I'm sat in the back of the byd dolphin I can fully stretch my arms out when it's sat when it's set up for my driving position this is just a that's that's quite tight isn't it long-legged folk might struggle back here is there any like cup cup holders and no bit of charge in there for one person simple small and simple it's all right you know I'm pleasantly surprised by it you've got 360 liters of space which is like 20 less than the Jeep Avenger but look they had to find the space somewhere so clearly they just took the space from the rear seats so they could put more space in the boot which is kind of what I mean I mean two big bags in there it's all right it's all right right charging it will take up to 11 kilowatts from a wall box or 100 kilowatts from a DC fast charger so that means it could be less than half an hour to charge the battery to 80 percent hello okay let's get on to the important bit which we all know is the price so the red which is the entry level model is 32 995 pounds and the posha La Prima which is the one that we've got here is 36 995 pounds that makes it cheaper than the Avenger and the Kona and the Vauxhall Corsa with the same battery and motor as this as well but it's obviously more than the Chinese Rivals of mg and byd so what do we think well I mean they're reasonably priced I mean let's be honest fear is a really really popular brand in the UK a lot of people love the 500e so I think a lot of people will love the 600e I think it will be a big seller because of look at how adorable it looks the question is is in terms of price in terms of space in terms of range other Chinese Brands just gonna pivot to the post are they going to sell as well I don't know let us know your thoughts by the way in the comments section below and don't forget to subscribe to the electrifying YouTube channel thank you very much
ejT6GwY6cSY,"Is This The Small, SIMPLE Electric Car We've Been Waiting For??",Fully Charged Show,hello this is the new Fiat 600 electric and it's a lot like the Fiat 500 electric but more 100 more okay but kidding aside important car this in fact I think you could go so far as to call this the most important electric Italian car that we've seen so far Fiat claims that what we have here is a practical rangy spacious yet small family car with a tasty price to boot and actually what I'm most excited about is that where so many of this car's Rivals tried to pull you in with needless acceleration and flashy features the Fiat is much more interested in two things that I am much more interested in comfort and efficiency if you like the fully charged show then you'll love our Live Events next up we're in Amsterdam for fully charged live Europe on the 24th 25th and 26th of November get your tickets today now then we're out on the road in the Fiat 600 electric worth noting we're just outside of Turin today uh I've opted to leave Turin to talk to the camera and film this video because as I very quickly learned during our microlino shoot here last year Shireen not the most relaxing place to film car reviews oh I was so lost already but as we were leaving the city I did do enough cobbly Street driving to ascertain that this is a nice comfortable car England is beaten perhaps only by Italy in terms of bumpiness of Road surface they love a cobble around here and this car is tuned accordingly it's an Italian car it's tuned for Italian roads therefore it's nice and squashy and that's just one of the things about this car that would make it an absolute Doddle to drive through town it is quite compact it's got a fairly short wheelbase meaning it's really really Nimble visibility is good the controls are so light in normal or eco mode you could steer it with a couple of fingers and you it's just a really easy relaxing car to move along the road very quiet very modest power as well I think barely 150 horsepower which is plenty for a car like this but not so much that you accidentally stress out all your passengers when you plant your foot so comfy quiet easy to drive one complaint actually no one pedal driving that's an absolute cardinal sin I can't believe that any new electric car is being released without it these days we've got drive and then we've got B which is the regen mode and if I take my foot off the throttle now there is the regen but it's not strong enough to bring the car to a complete stop which means I can't do one pedal driving and that is annoying design wise well I don't want to spend too long on this bit because big 500 in it that would be my concise summary you can see all the iconic design details we've got the circular lamps although they're split in half like they are on the 500 electric and as the law dictates this is of course a crossover so it's a little bit jacked up you've got the plastic cladding around the wheels it's just a little bit more chunk to it than it's smaller sibling it's a nice enough looking thing it's certainly nothing groundbreaking I actually think the most interesting thing about the way it looks is the color because Fiat have done away with gray they vowed never to offer any of their new cars in Gray ever again it's all part of their Endeavor to just create a more cheerful colorful brand identity and I like that more orange cars please anyway enough about that I think much more interesting than the design is the size of this vehicle because you could well be looking at this thinking oh great another medium-sized crossovery thing but actually this is a small sized crossover effect it's more compact than just about any other electric family car you'd care to mention 4.1 meters long it's shorter than an mg4 so dinky little car but one that claims to offer big space inside that's one of the big selling points of the 600 according to Fiat is that true we'll find out in a moment when we put a Jack in the back but I can show you this for starters a class leading sized boot at 360 liters look at that that's a pretty big boot for a pretty small car decent sized opening flat floor false floor underneath it good to see one complaint with the boots is that it sounds like a reversing rubbish truck coming at you when it closes and then at the end it slaps it's quite stressful a small gripe a couple of other numbers while I'm at it 51 kilowatt hour usable that's the only batch entry available on the 600 and that is good for 250 miles of wltp range 250 miles from 51 kilowatt hours of battery efficiency more on that later that's 375 miles of urban range by the way seriously impressive numbers and here's one final number for you and this is an important one 33 000 pounds that is the entry price for the Fiat 600e now people get cross when I use the word affordable to describe cars that cost 30 something thousand pounds and I understand that but let's be clear that makes this one of the absolute cheapest five-seater long-range electric family cars really only the mg4 comes in underneath this with anywhere near as much range that is an impressive price well we're lost in the outskirts of Turin and forced to turn around and shamefully retrace my footsteps but let's just take a moment to acknowledge a crisp that reversing camera is also very very tight turning circle on on the car which makes it really really easy to uh oh squeeze down Tony ancient medieval Italian strings like these foreign [Music] welcome to reviews of cars going backwards the did not think would be testing the reversing camera quite this thoroughly today [Music] now inside the Fiat 600 electric and it's a continuation of the cheerful Italian Vibes we get from the outside what have we got then well a lot of this is reminding me of the Jeep Avenger again a car that will share a lot of bits with this one because they're both stalantis products same platform same Bank of physical buttons here for things like climate control and demisting this is going to make a lot of people happy just big physical easy to hit buttons and look there's more of them on the wheel it's not haptic and I don't have to open a menu within a menu to change my fan speed nice to see I think on the whole this is still the preferred method of fiddling with things like your climate isn't it especially when it's done in a way that doesn't necessarily clutter the cabin and I don't feel that this does I like this little Bank of buttons to select your gear as well that's quite a nice little touch this I'm a fan of this kind of slightly magnetic iPad cover-esque lid for the glove box in which I find a bit of storage a wireless charger more storage cup holders little teeny bit of storage in there nice little rubbery shelf here just to put your key in it doesn't go flying storage is what I'm trying to say to you storage and again bearing in mind that this is one of the cheapest electric family cars on sale you don't necessarily feel hyper aware of that in here when you touch stuff in the mg4 it feels a bit affordable it'll be fair to say but actually they've put nice materials in all the important places here to make it feel good at least at first impression so got nice Supple material on the steering wheel this on the higher spec version is a faux leather that actually feels really plush and soft and I like I like the Fiat stitching in there now the eagle-eyed among you may have noticed this which can only be described as a gear tunnel and yes this car is not sitting on bespoke EV architecture it's what stalantis calls a multi-energy platform there will be a hybrid version of this car there won't be a pure ice version but both of them sit on the same architecture and designed to accommodate both now the pro of that for Fiat for stalantis is it's a fairly affordable and efficient way of building cars which enables them to keep the price low the disadvantage is of course space we do have a bit of room in there but there would be more were it not for the fact that space has been saved for the gearbox of the hybrid version and in the back is where you are most affected in my opinion now we know I'm tall that's well documented but if I'm being completely honest with you I basically couldn't get into that back seat not in my driving position not even when I scooch forward to the safest most forward driving position that I would be okay with it's barely room for me to get my feet in back there good Headroom mind you just the leg room is a little cramped back there and again I am unusually tall I think a normal person driving you'll be able to fit a normal person behind them just fine and it's also worth noting that these B segment cars have never been spacious historically it's always been a square trees in the back in these smaller cars but if this were sitting on bespoke EV architecture like the mg4 for example you'd be able to get a proper sized human back there and that is a big big thing that the mg has over this car my main issue with this interior is this screen the software is great it's intuitive it's reasonably quick but the screen's the wrong size it's very long and thin which means when I pull up my navigation I can see what's to the left and right of me but not very far in front [Music] and then here's the thing I'm potentially most excited about with this car it is bloody efficient today we've been doing all sorts of driving uphill downhill City mountains twisty straight we've done the lot and without even thinking about efficiency without even trying to drive in an efficient manner I've achieved wait for it just under nine kilowatt hours per 100 kilometers what on Earth is that in human language I think that's well clear of six miles to the kilowatt hour that's a big efficiency and I'm not going to do my whole long spiel about why efficiency is such a big deal in electric cars because I'm sure a lot of you have heard it before but the short version is it's not just about getting you further on a charge it's also about enabling Fiat to put less battery in each car enabling them to sell them cheaper making the cars Greener making them lighter and more enjoyable oh I did the Spiel I did it by accident but it makes everything better when a car is efficient and efficiency is still so under prioritized in electric vehicle design so this is great to see and how have they achieved it well they've done it by making this a relatively small and light car relatively oh loony they've done it with a much more efficient design of motor for these V2 cars the same motor going into the new Jeep Avenger which I'll be driving soon but they've also done it by just not overpowering the car they've given it a modest little motor and remove the temptation to drive it in a silly way I have actually been driving an eco mode this whole time because it doesn't matter it's not a sporty car I have no desire to drive it sportly so then first impressions of this new Fiat 600 Electric well in short positive I would say I mean first of all let's just acknowledge the fact that there is still so few electric cars of this size at this price point that I'm just happy to see another one show up anytime it does but this does appear to be a pretty impressive one and look we'll need to spend a bit more time with this car before passing final judgment but I think what we can confidently say from our first day with it is that it's efficient affordable easy to use and cheerful and there's not many electric cars that you could apply all four of those words to so it's a pretty good start so there we go then the Fiat 600 electric please make sure to like And

bxgXvFlt9aY,Fiat 600e review – Bigger but better than the Fiat 500e? | batchreviews (James Batchelor),batchreviews,you don't need me to tell you the Italians are great at building characterful cars they've been making them for decades take the latest Fiat 500e it's not just charismatic for an Italian car but it's the most Charming EV on sale right now full stop Fiat wants to re-establish itself as the master of smaller cars and to do so it's returning to the B segment hatchback Market the last time Fiat was here was in 2018 with the punto [Music] but Fiat is back with not one but two new models there's a brand new Fiat Panda coming next year but in the meantime there's this the all-new Fiat 600e oh it's the new bigger brother to the 500e and it's a family hatchback but with a slightly rugged crossover look but beneath the 500 design cues the 600e shares a lot with its sister car the Jeep Avenger when I say share I mean it basically Nicks the Jeep's platform it's 154 brake horsepower electric motor and it's 54 kilowatt hour battery pack which also happens to be the same Hardware as the Peugeot e2008 as well it's an easy reason for all of this they're all built by stellantis so there's a lot of family love going on here even the dashboard is taken pretty much Lock Stock and Barrel from the Jeep Avenger but there are some Fiat retro touches like on this La Prima version we've got this Ivory colored panel on the dashboard and the seats they're embossed with the Fiat logo probably to remind you what car you're driving if you've forgotten aside from these features though and the strange cover that looks like an iPad cover that hides the central cubby there isn't quite the same Delight that you get in the 500e and while Everything feels robust there are too many scratchy Plastics on the dash and on the doors for my liking the infotainment system works well though there's decent space in the back boot room stands at 360 liters but only La Prima models get a movable boot floor prices start at a reasonable 32 995 for the entry-level red model and rise to 36.995 for the La Prima which means the 600e undercuts the Avenger and the E 2008 but not the mg4 if you want a charging cable though fear to relieve you of 400 pounds which seems a bit stingy to me what's it like to drive then well if you're expecting this to be a typical electric car an absolutely fly towards the horizon when you put your foot on the throttle then you're going to be disappointed because this is not a quick car not to 62 miles now takes nine seconds and if you put this car in eco mode which you probably will if you want to eke out that claimed 250 mile range it feels that you're not going anywhere at all but I'm probably being a little bit too harsh because this is a family SUV after all or family crossover hatchbacking do you really want Lightning Fast reactions in your family car probably not the acceleration is probably more than good enough now I do like the ride it is particularly good in this 600e it's probably the best ride aside from the ec4 of all of these stellantis electric crossover SUVs now we're driving this car in the home of Fiat Turin and the roads are as crumbly as you'll find in Britain and this car has just sailed over them you do get the sense that when you hit a pothole it sort of Glides over you hear the wheel go in the pothole we don't necessarily feel it and that really does bode well for the car in the UK the steering is very light it's more than accurate enough but it does feel a little bit light although I would say happily it does weight up when you pick your speed up [Music] this is a very likable car and one that I think would be very easy to live with I also think it'll be a strong seller here in Britain because we love Italian chic the 600e is also the best example of a larger Fiat 500 I've seen but there's still the feeling that the 600es character is just a little Skin Deep the 500e it's the real deal foreign I suppose what I'm trying to say is that the 600e doesn't woo you like the 500e does but what the 600e lacks in Charisma it makes up in usability this is a well-priced and spacious family SUV crossover EV hatchback call it what you will this is a great all-rounder it just doesn't make you want to own it unconditionally
HLquNEYSKWk,A FUN Family Car?! New Fiat 600 Review - & Why The Ford Puma's Worried,cinch,"[Music] the fat 500 has long been a hit with the fashionistas of this world so much so that they even made a Gucci version but it's always had one big problem and that's the fact that it isn't big it's been really small which is why fat has produced this the new 600 well technically this one's a 600e but just like the hybrid version that'll join it later this year it gets more doors more space and more style or at least does it have enough of those three things to lure you fashion Easter away from a in Alternatives like the mini Countryman the Ford Puma or the pjo 2008 it certainly has a good go at it with a dying price of $29,995 thanks to the £3,000 discount that at the time of filming is being offered by f on it EVS it makes the 600e a full 7 Grand cheaper than a Kia e Nero and 500 crit cheaper than the mgzs and it helps to alleviate some of the 600s quite significant shortfalls which we'll reveal in this video after talking fashion now the first rule of being fashion able is to look stylish and the 600 definitely has a good go at doing that come with me down here because you'll spot the first of many 600 badges across this car in fact we're going to count them as we walk around it but I think it wears it proudly just like any kind of fashion item that wears its logo everywhere Anyway come with me around here and you'll spot the first familiar part of the car to the 500 E this headlight with its so-called eyeliner but I think it looks a bit stoned well yeah this is obviously a carryover of what you got in the 500d it looks quite smart here with another 600 badge down here the wheels on this La Prima top spec car are 17 in on the base red car red as in the trim level not the color you only get hub caps with Steels this is a bigger wheel therefore it's probably heavier but it is a flat design and doesn't have many openings so it should be good for range although we'll test that a bit later and your spot it's got a studded design as well if you follow me down to the side skirt another 600 badge albe it's just half of one another one there and then another 600 badge on a tail light cluster that looks very familiar from the 500 E I like this u-shaped design here you'll spot the studs they match those on the wheels so stylish I think first fat badge that we've spotted and we've got this spoiler up here and then if you cast your gaze down there we have ourselves another 600 badge with an Italian flag in case you forgetting where this car's [Music] from and the last one is on the steering wheel now the interior overall is definitely a bit of an improvement on the 500 when it comes to space because obviously there's more of the stuff especially above me here and also you've got a nice setup around you I've got a digital instrument cluster as standard ahead of me plus an infotainment system here and that infotainment system is actually pretty good the thing I like about it is it's fast it's responsive you've got Wireless Apple carplay and Android auto and plus you've got shortcuts so it's easy to navigate around even if you you get lost you also have tactile and manual buttons for your climate control so if you don't want to fiddle with the screen well you just press buttons down here which is nice and they're quite long so if you've got long nails they should be easy to use and all the weighting and everything just feels quality but also very easy now it's a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to storage in the car because while it's definitely a lot better than the 500 E compared to some of the rivals it's not the best in the class although you still have a decent amount of space you got space down here to put cups and mug or whatever space in here as well and it's quite deep and then under this cover you've got a wireless charging M and a couple of USB C's as well as a 12volt port but you've got this clumsy iPad cover style thing here which I mean firstly it looks like it's going to get a bit dirty quite quickly and secondly it's always in the way apart from when it's down so that's not ideal and then you've also got this flat patch up here which is rubbery which looks like it's supposed to take your phone but you're going to put your phone in there so I guess maybe it's for your passenger and I have to say the door pockets are quite narrow I can't get my keep Cup in there and I can't get my refillable water bottle in there so yes you can put them here but I like having it in the door sometimes so that's a small negative up front overall though it's a nice stylish place to sit and I really like the finish with the cream and the black but I have to show you possibly the worst thing in the front of the interior and that is the glove box which is Tiny now obviously the back seats are where the key advantage over the 500 ears because here we've got three of them and obviously it's bigger as well I've got way more Headroom and I can fit technically it's snug but my knees fit and my feet fit as well so this isn't really a place for fully grown adults not for long Journeys anyway but for a teenager or for a kid well yeah it's okay although you don't get a few Creature Comforts that you'd think come as standard in 2024 firstly there's no armrest to fold out of this seat here so there are no cup holders as well plus you've only got one USBC port and no ven and you don't even get door Pockets down there so if you've got a bottle or a cup well you're going to have to hold it unless you can seal it and put it in this here I mean it's not great at least the windows go down all the way which isn't common these days properly all the way down and isopix bars are very easy to access something is telling me this back seat interior is designed for very small kids all those in child seats rather than anything bigger now you won't be surprised to hear that the boot of the 600 is much bigger than the boot of the 500 the 500 boot is Tiny by any standard whereas here we've got a pretty usable amount of space so much so that it swallows jal's camera bag with ease and handily you've got some underfloor storage as well to hide away your charge cable in this electric car I'd expect that floor space underneath to grow a bit when the hybrid model comes later this year but even so this is comparable with a big hatchback although it's definitely not the biggest in the class I think that title will go to other model models including maybe the mini Countryman or the Ford pummer which has that amazing underfloor storage space but it's okay oh yeah and we can also confirm that the electric tailgate won't chop your kids' hands off which is good now we just need to find out if the 600 drives as nicely as the 500 or if it feels like the lazier heavier puzle now behind the wheel of this 600 you really do feel that fashionista Vibe right away and that's because it gets all of those Vogue Essentials that are fitted to the 5 00 I'm looking at the same dashboard that you get in a 500e and that's a really nice place to be so that feeling that emotion carries over into this 600 I was expecting it to feel a little bit like uh a bit slobby and a bit a bit less nice to steer down a road versus the 500 which is a good driving car but actually on this bumpy section of British B- road that we're on not only does it ride nicely but it also steers nicely as well it feels effortless all the controls are very light touch all feels good quality as well and the same goes even for the indicator stalks and the buttons that you touch everything just feels well judged and well matched to make life easy and make driving very simple now you do get a bunch of Drive modes you get just three you've got an Eco you've got a normal and you've got a sport and the normal is as you'd expect it makes the car feel nippy energetic but not particularly rapid all right let's get into sport see how it changes the car cuz we're on a twisty road now and yeah instantly I can feel that acceler ation is better I mean fear claims are not to 62 time if you're interested of 9 seconds which is nippy certainly nippy enough for Town and Country and Motorway driving and because this car steers and rides so nicely it's actually quite fun to drive there is one minor gripe I've noticed from behind the wheel and that is that there is a little bit of road noise all the time as the road surface changes you'll definitely hear the coarser sounds coming through the car it's not overly intrusive but it's one to know and because obviously there's no engine noise in this electric version well there's nothing to drown it out although having said that who drives with the radio off St in sport here's a launch yeah it's nippy not quick is it it's not a neck breaker no not a neck breaker now what about the Turning Circle in this car let's give it a go there's no one around me that's not bad it's okay it's okay I mean that's definitely up there with with cars of this class better than your petrol ones I would say um it's not too bad I mean I almost did a proper U-turn there on a B- Road right reversing camera hopefully no Angry farmers will come out who could be angry with such a happy looking car right visibility is really good even without the camera actually I can see around the car very clearly but the camera is very useful it's nice and sharp and I've got a 3D above view as well which means not only am I aware of what's behind me but I I can also see what's around me and even in front of me a little bit so that's quite good and then you can also make the view bigger and focus it entirely on the reversing camera itself rather than that above you so that's good good visibility easy to drive done a bit of wheel spin oh trash control there oh yeah and on the subject of driving Tech this car has plenty of driver assistance features you get a real long list including Lan keep assist and adaptive cruise control but also really really good is that there's a home button for the infotainment screen and there's also a car button so you press that and it shortcuts you to your driver assistance features and you can turn them off and you can even save that button so that it will turn off some of those features just to press of it now I'm into a village and I can see that it's really easy to thread it through these narrow Lanes not only does the car respond quite keenly but also my visibility is great I can see where the Bonnet is front and left look I'm having to break to let this guy go and I know there's loads of space in fact everything's happening it feels like I'm on my driving test people reversing out of driveways but I feel confident that even if someone pulled out of me I've got a car Nimble and agile enough and able to squeeze through gaps enough that I don't have to worry too much God I'm really enjoying driving this little thing actually it's not even that listful but it feels it and that's what matters when you're not driving around in circles and you actually want to make progress the 600e and its compact 54 kwh battery can eal 254 Mi on a mixed driving route it's quick to charge too with a 100 Kow plug compatib ability ensuring a rapid charge time of under 30 minutes although if speed is your priority you might want to wait for the abbath version of the car which will trade on range for a hot 240 horsepower output cannot wait for that all right so if you're looking for a 500e that's more spacious and just as stylish the 600e definitely offers all of those things although there are Rivals that are more practical and definitely more spacious inside but with the price tag of this thing especially with that SP discount well I think it's very very competitive but if you want to see how this car Stacks up to similar SUVs watch this video here"
1OWaEGStiA0,New Fiat 600e (2024) | FIRST LOOK,Planet Car News,[Music] thank you [Music] foreign
FknVzDA15bE,Fiat 600e review (2024): A Larger 500e But Still Affordable! | TotallyEV,TotallyEV,"the Fiat 500e is among one of my favorite small-sized electric vehicles but the 600e is its larger sibling now at the time of filming and in the UK the manufacturer is offering £3,000 off the list price at least for retail customers meaning that the 600e starts from just shy of £30,000 while if you go for the topspec La Prima it will come in at just £34,000 so it is review seeing if it's actually worth its price tag and how it compares to some of its competitors so to kick things off let's talk about Electric range and very much like other vehicles from the stantis group the Fiat 600e houses the same 54 KW hour grow or 51 Kow hour net battery pack there is also a heat pump that comes included as standard which is certainly appreciated the manufacturer claims that you will get roughly 253 mil at least on the wltp test cycle however from my own mixed driving test I ned between 200 to 220 Mi which ironically is absolutely identical to what I actually netted in the Jeep Avenger now it's worth considering however that the 600e is significantly cheaper than the Jeep Avenger and it's also a lot better in terms of the overall range in comparison to the Fiat 500e as you'll be able to see from this mileage leaderboard where the latter actually got roughly 140 to 160 mi from my own mix driving test suffice to say that the 600e actually does fair pretty well specifically considering its overall price tag now for you to be as efficient as possible there is a degree of regenerative braking and there is a button that is found towards the center console right now I'm in B mode so I'm just going to accelerate a little bit towards this bus and then lift off and as you'll be able to see that the vehicle starts decelerating relatively rapidly but in my opinion it's not as harsh as it should be indeed you haven't got a one pedal drive the same sort of complaint was said about all of the other vehicles from the stantis group it would have been great if there was a degree of customization or indeed that full one pedal drive because it makes those inner city drives a little less cumbersome now of course you do have the ability of plugging it in and VI C CS Port it will take up to 100 KW of input therefore allowing you to go from 20 to 80% in just 27 minutes VI its type 2 Port it has actually got an 11 KW onboard charger and therefore if you do have access to a three-phase power supply you can go from 0 to 100% in 5 hours and 45 minutes while if you do connect it up to a regular wallbox it'll take you roughly 8 hours while a 3 pin socket will take you over 30 hours so what about when it comes to Performance well here there is a single front mounted motor which dispatches all the power to the front wheels anded you've got a front-wheel drive configuration now in its sport mode preset you will get the maximum amount of power 115 KW or 154 horsepower and 260 Newt M of torque in the normal mode this drops down to 80 KW or 109 horsepower and 220 newon met of torque and in eco mode it goes down to 60 KW or 82 horsepower and 180 Newton M of torque now I actually she had it tested using race logic's performance box touch from 0 to 20 mph in 2.44 seconds 0 to 30 mph in 3.68 seconds 0 to 60 mph in 8.65 seconds and notes that is pretty much bang on to the manufacturer 0 to 62 mph claim of 9 seconds and then 50 to 70 mph in 4.78 seconds and a peak acceleration of just 0.3 HG top speed is rated at 93 mph now indeed the vehicle performance is quite lackluster specifically if you consider some of the Alternatives out there on the market but nonetheless I do think it will certainly suffice for most consumers what's more important however is the overall driving comfort and in this respect the vehicle is actually tuned to Perfection now sure enough its suspension system is a little bit stiff in comparison to some Alternatives out there even from the stellantis group themselves with the likes of the Citron ec4 or EC 4X but in this respect it's far superior than the Jeep Avenger which suffered from low-end resonance when traversing on uneven terrain that's not the case in the 600e so I'm very pleased to see that Fiat has actually thought about the insulating material furthermore the steering wheel is actually very light making the vehicle very easy to maneuver but on the flip side it does mean that the Fiat doesn't exactly inight that overall driver's feel or indeed that level of confidence when you're going around winding country routes this is in part due to the fact that youve got a front-wheel drive configuration and that you also suffer from a bit of body roll if you're going to be really chucking around winding country routs so aside from how is on the road what about when it comes to its interior design well given the overall price point of the 600e and also the Fiat pedigree I've actually got no complaints whatsoever it certainly does stand out in comparison to for example the mg4 EV yes indeed you have got really nice stitching work around the upholstery you've got nice use of materials towards the dashboard and even in terms of the door frames the overall design and the look of it certainly is there of course you're still going to get some cheap plastic around the dashboard but I've not got any major complaints I also love the fact that Fiat has preserved some physical buttons you'll find them on the steering wheel and also towards the dashboard where they'll serve as shortcut buttons for the infotainment system for example your climate controls you've also still got a physical knob for the volume now as for the infotainment system it's actually very responsive you've got a 10.25 in display which has got a pretty intuitive feel to it at least when you get your head around it it also supports Android auto and apple carplay over a wide and wireless trans Mission it's worth noting if you do want the built-in navigation system you'll have to go for the LA primat Trim because it's not available in the entry level red model now no matter if you're using the built-in navigation system or the thirdparty mobile operating systems you will be pleased to know that turn-based navigation data does feed through to the 7in instrument cluster indeed this fully digitalized display does provide you all the key information that you require and it's good to see that level of integration is also there which isn't the same that could be said about some of its Rivals if it is a shame however that a head-up display is not offered be it in the more expensive trim level or indeed available as an option speaking of which there's no means of actually changing the audio system because in the entry-level red trim you'll have a four speaker setup while in the lapr Prima model you'll have a six speaker configuration the latter does relatively well across the sound frequency range and will keep most people excited but it's certainly not going to compete with more audio file Centric products out there so moving on let's talk about storage and towards the front of the cabin you've got the glove box although it's a shame that it's not been optimized for right-and drive vehicles which I do think is quite lazy from the manufacturer nonetheless you have got the door bins where they'll accommodate a 500ml bottle with ease alongside some small to mediumsized valuables it's a shame yet again not to see any sort of fabric material therefore meaning that your loose change or keys will be heard rattling about when you're traversing uneven terrain now towards the center of the dashboard you'll find a small little cubby hole which can be handy for placing your wireless key fob or your wallet or small small size purse and then you have got a 15 L compartment which is comprised underneath an iPad light cover this is also removal if you so wish here you'll find a wireless charger which is present in the topspec La Prima trim and then you'll find a 12volt socket alongside a USB type A and type- C Port the latter is used for connecting up to the infotainment system there is another USB type-c port that is found towards the rear of the center console so moving down the center console you'll find a small customizable area with the small little plastic ins allowing you to place let's say a can or small size water bottle or indeed you can fully open it up for that increased amount of storage you have also gots the small compartment that is found within the center armrest although it's relatively narrow so you're not going to fit any sort of large size Goods as for the rear of the cabin it's pretty limited you have not got a pull down armrest compartment for your cup holders and the door bins are pretty much non-existent now of course you have got its boots where you've got 360 L to play around with or if you drop down the seats 1,231 L Which is far superior than its smaller sibling the 500e which SATs at 185 and 550 lers respectively sure enough it's not exactly class leading figures but it will certainly suffice for doing your weekly shops furthermore it's actually pretty practical with a hatchback design you've also got 6040 rear s split folding seats in the La Prima model you'll also have an adjustable boot floor which means that you have got a small little underfloor compartment for your charging cables and you've also got an electric tailgate that comes fitted as standard and top spec variant now I should also point out that the rear seats have not got any sort of seat belt Runners which makes it a little bit more cumbersome if you're going to be dropping down the seats regularly a complaint that I have about some of its competitors as well but just something I thought I should highlight in the 600e now as for the overall seating Comfort I've got no issues whatsoever the seats themselves are actually very accommodating and soft at the front you will also find in the La Prima model that they become heated and also you have got six-way electronic controls for the driver's seat with a massage function function which is very much appreciated now as for Headroom towards the rear of the cabin it's a little bit limited but certainly should suffice given that the vehicle itself is pretty compact however leg room is going to be a bit of an issue specifically if you're transporting adults it of course won't be a problem if you have got children or younger adults but it's just something worth highlighting so see if you're comparing this vehicle to slightly larger SUVs it's also further disappointing that you still have a transmission tunnel in a fully electric vehicle moving swiftly on let's talk about it exterior design and I'll be curious to know what you make of it down the comment section below subjectively I don't think it's as cute looking as the 500e but it still has got that stylish profile and of course that is due to fiat's DNA at the front you'll see it thanks to the headlights and the Bonnet and towards the side you have actually got 16in steel wheels which actually don't look too bad in the red trim while in the La Prima model you'll have much more stylish 18in diamond cut Alloys it is a shame however that the automaker has still preserved plastic wheel archers and S skirts but thankfully they don't protrude Too Much from the exterior shell as for the rear I've got no complaints whatsoever it fits in with fiat's other vehicles and still preserves the remnants of the 500e now as for your color options the red model comes as with the name suggest in red as standard however you can go for a black or white finish for an additional £600 the La Prima model however really UPS the anti with the sea Earth sky or sun of Italy finishes really standing out in comparison to what else you can find out there on the market so what about when it comes to safety well at the time of filming the Fiat 600e has not been tested by Euro encap so I can't talk about it overall crash safety scores but what I can comment about are the driver assistance systems now as standard on both trim levels you'll find cruise control and intelligent speed assistant drowsy driver detection traffic sign information autonomous emergency break Lane keep assist which by the way can actually be pretty easily disabled by pressing a shortcut button found on the dashboard and then going on the infotainment system and disabling set option and in the La Prima model you'll find blind spot detection with adaptive cruise control which actually does work a treat on the motorway keeping you at a safe distance from the leading vehicle now as for parking and visibility it's a little bit Limited at least towards the front as someone who's just under 6t I feel that the placement of the rear viiew mirror does obscure some of my frontal Vision the same complaints were said of pretty much every single vehicle reviewed from the stantis group nonetheless the apas are relatively thin and you've got good openings towards the side the same could be said towards the rear also thanks to the fact that you have also got a wiper although it's pretty disappointing that you've only got rear parking sensors in the red trim if you want front side and rear parking sensors and also 180° camera then you'll actually have to Splash out on the La Prima trim so with all that in mind it brings me on to my verdict and truthfully I was actually taken back by the Fiat 600e sure enough it shares many similarities with other vehicles from the stantis group with perso voxel Citron and even Jeep however it does stand out in comparison to its siblings and even indeed its competitors it's very stylish both inside and out it also has got good use of Technology within the cabin and plenty of driver assistance systems that come featur their standard you've also got a more practical design thank to its larger boot in comparison to the smaller 500e more importantly however it's pretty comfortable to drive and also has got a decent electric range combining all of this at a tempting price of roughly 30 to £34,000 depending on which trim level you go for and it makes this vehicle easy to recommend as such it gets Our Best Buy award now I'll be curious to know what you make of the 600e down the comment section below and if you would pick it over some of its Rivals if you have enjoyed this detailed independent review definitely do consider dropping a like subscribing and hitting that
