John 3:16-21 

16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

Mark 1.15 
15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

2 Peter 3:9
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

Hebrews 11:6
6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

I've been driving Alfas, Abarths and Fiats for the last 20 years and loved them all, even with their quirkiness, but unfortunately my next car is less likely to be a Fiat. 
Our current 500x is just a bit too tight in the back for legroom. So no chance with the 600...
I like this car, I would have one, but its too small in the back for our needs for the next few years and I'm a bit gutted about it.

16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

Mark 1.15 
15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

2 Peter 3:9
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

Hebrews 11:6
6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

What we dont get, is why people need 4 door saloons, for the rare occasion that the ""friends"" don't have a car, and claim yours to be transported. 
We are a household of 2, and never ever need more than a 2-door car.  When the kids with grandkids ask us to take the grandkids, we also switch cars. 
So nobody is needlessly riding around all year with a car that is to expansive, to big, to heavy, and uses to much energy for every km. 
We really don't get that ""urge"" for a behemoth SUV like all the neighbors in the street. Wasn't an EV all about ""better for the environment""? 
So why bigger, heavier, more material and more expansive . . . .  for that 1 time a year to transport friends? Cant they take the bus?",2024-03-08T17:22:13Z

A few cars to consider instead:

Model 3 
MG4 
VW ID3: Yes even this. It has better software, way better assist systems, more space, a bit more range, charges faster, is RWD (which works better than FWD for EVs, trust me), has way more power, and is a joy to drive.

If the car was 30 K yes, but not 35K starting and 42K for a nice one. Competition is too hot for that with these stats and that cheap interior.",2024-03-09T00:04:08Z

Frankly, the only really ""substantial difference"" between and EV and ICE platform is that EV platform doesn't have to have an exhaust/transmission tunnel across it! 
and EV's are ""roomier"" because they are usually taller (have a flatter to be true, but much fatter floor) than ICE cars.... otherwise, there's no particular ""technological advance"" of EV platform over ICE one.

The 500e is unfortunately just too small for my needs, so when I learned of this 600e, I was very hopeful that it could be truly great. You can imagine how disappointed I was to hear how awful the steering is then. That's killed it for me. How can over light steering be easier to drive? It would be like driving a video game, something I've never managed as I lack whatever it takes to guess what the car is doing without feedback. As well as this, surely it is just nice to feel the car and be involved in the driving experience? Shame most manufacturers don't agree with me! Great review as always, thanks.",2023-09-26T22:27:44Z

2023-09-23T09:38:34Z,@diwe9984,VokQJrHzBR8,"Why shouldn't the Fiat have an engine? An electric machine is also a motor (but also a generator) - the difference lies in the direction of energy conversion: In the generator, the rotor is driven mechanically and thereby generates electrical energy in the windings of the stator. With a motor, the same machine is supplied with electrical energy and thereby generates mechanical energy.

I like the 600 and I don't need 70 or 100 kWh batteries in the car. Visually, I haven't found a Chinese manufacturer that I like - except for the Seal from BYD, which is not a desirable car for me, I need more ground clearance every day (often on dirt roads, etc.).

Of course drivers are different, but as a passenger I don't like that my head are rolling for unnecessarry regen-braking because the driver don't have steady right foot. I suppose that everybody now know that one pedal driving came because Tesla didn't manage so smooth regen braking on the brake pedal as they wanted and found it easier with tuning for a one pedal driving.

The biggest problem with EVs IS the cost - it is so, so much more!  Like an average of 10 grand more for the EV versus the ICE car on any given make/model in the UK..
10 thousand pounds!
¬£10,000!!!
And this car is the same... over ¬£10,000 more than I paid for my ICE car (and my car is fitted with every conceivable toy)
A ¬£10,000 price difference means the ICE car owner is already better off!
10 grand buys you well over 3,500 gallons of diesel at current UK prices.
So... the price difference means that I effectively have 3500 gal of 'free' fossil fuel - compared to owning this EV üòÇ So it really doesn't matter how good the range improvements become on an Exploding Vehicle or how cheap is to charge... Owning my ICE car means I effectively have 3500 gallons of free fuel.
And 3500 gal at the 55mpg average I do is 77,000 miles! That means my ICE car is cheaper to own/run for around 6 years... at which time this EV might start to claw some ground back ü§£
...until it needs a new battery in another 3 years, and the EV owner is another ¬£10,000 out of pocket ü§£ü§£ü§£
77,000 miles!

What really sucks is the rich are the only people that can afford EVs, and they get to enjoy the provincial and federal government rebates(where available).  When they finally sell them after 2 or 3 years, (because they always like to drive something new) they don't pass along the savings that they enjoyed.  So they are still expensive, still somewhat rare (because of supply issues), and the subsequent owners that buy it used are still overpaying for what they are getting.  Also, with the pandemic and the new ""carbon tax"" that just came into effect a few months ago, the cost of gasoline has almost doubled in price from just 5 years ago.  As the poor people are forced to continue to use ICE cars, they are now paying several thousand more per year just in gas.  ...and the poor keep getting poorer.  üò•  It's just not fair.",2023-09-27T04:00:29Z

Bah! Never mind range or performance or looks or efficiency or luxury or even safety - wealthy drivers already have plenty of options there. And nobody is asking them to give up their current models. Buy and enjoy. But we proles have no choices. Where's our modern-day Trabant?

In 2019 and even june 2020 i could get multiple different models for less than 8000‚Ç¨ incl. everything
now it is 4,5 times the prices and you call it low ?

ID.3 is 426 cm and therefore this car is not small, maybe you are too tall to judge about what a small car is ?

I can not remember exactly what these models were, but in those days we were comparing them with an e-Up fully equipped which was back then 25000‚Ç¨ even though after grants and a discount 13600‚Ç¨ which was a lot more than such new citroen and peugeot and what ever would have had cost. 

37000‚Ç¨ is even more than a MG4 which is golf sized car. For sure it is a Fiat with the usual fiat quality and all the rust included if you do not live in italy or spain and not too close to the sea cause no Fiat has ever been made for salt water and rain .

FYI I grew up in rural Cheshire (plenty of twisties), and I've driven my MG4 in Wales - which invented the windy rural road. It handles just fine, the brakes are fine (the transition from regen to actual braking is undetectable), the low centre of gravity & rear wheel drive make it decently entertaining.

The cheapest Dacia Sandero in the official UK shop starts at 14K, yet you cannot drive through the center of London with it even today, and who knows how many cities will join in a couple of years, so unless you live in a remote part of Scotland where you visit just local town shop, I would not bother with anything that is not at least hybrid. Dacia Sandero also received a 2/5 star rating in safety tests which is another reason for most in Western Europe to not even bother...
When you consider that you must go to around 20k (if you are lucky) to get at least a decent somewhat reliable small hatchback hybrid like Toyota Yaris, and take into account all the fuel and maintenance expenses over the expected 15-20 year lifespan, EVs financial side suddenly does not look that bad...
But things start to get really interesting for normal people only once you look at a few years old cars which are currently the only ones priced somewhat reasonably because the new hybrid Yaris which price rose by over 1/3 from pre-pandemic times is hardly a great deal, while EVs due to fast innovation in this segment often dropping in prices a lot to a levels even normal people can afford them these days...",2023-10-03T06:02:49Z

Prices of popular electric cars like Skoda Eniaq or Ford Lightning have risen over 20% from their initial price while Tesla despite reducing factory worker wages as they are not unionized openly told that they were keeping higher prices than necessary to compensate for the unpredictability of the market during the pandemic but as wages will rise due to strikes to level up with inflation, you can bet that further rise in the cost of cars in unionized factories is inevitable and while Tesla can reduce prices due to recent improvements in manufacturing efficiency, legacy manufacturers purchasing costlier than necessary batteries and lacking purpose build EV factories will be hard pressed to follow Tesla's market gain due to price reductions for years to come which they would do likely anyway as there is higher demand than supply for multiple non-Tesla EVs. So, don't worry, everything will be costlier and that trend will continue for years despite pandemic more or less being a non-issue for developed nations at this point until the supply chain and factory worker wages stabilize.
Many governments trying to push EVs by making ICE cars less viable through various legislations while there is also a visible push to get as many people from car to public transport as possible by making ICE cars unfeasible is one of the ways, if the US will have decent public transportation you will see exactly the same trend repeating there too...
This trend will make many people in rural areas angry as already happened in France where leadership was bluntly trying to raise the gasoline tax ""for the sake of the environment"" despite rural folks often don't have much choice, so if this will not be handled with regard to economic limitations of various groups, you can expect a lot of riots in the future as govenrments will try to push poorly conceived legislations...",2023-10-07T11:30:36Z

The somewhat sensible way to buy a new car is to PCP it (where you're only paying for the depreciation, basically) or lease it and worry less about some of the wear and tear costs.  At the end of the day, it's never really a good idea to lump tens of thousands into any depreciating asset with no protection against depreciation, which is why PCP is the more affordable and sensible way of doing it, on the proviso that you get good APR - but you often get little incentives for taking the finance (e.g. dealer contribution discount).",2023-09-27T14:16:15Z
2023-09-27T15:18:20Z,@xxwookey,ejT6GwY6cSY,"@@wheeldesire If you intend to keep a vehicle for a long time then outright purchase is by far the cheapest option. But obviously you only get that option if you do actually have the cash. So I don't agree with the idea that it's 'never' a good idea to invest in an expensive depreciating asset. 
The shorter the ownership period the lower the extra costs of PCP or leasing, which as you say, do have advantages in terms of de-risking. The dealers are keen to get you to take the finance because that is normally more profitable for them than a cash sale.
It's certainly true that most people choose the certainty of a fixed monthly outgoing, but should recognise that one is paying extra to minimise risk of loss/gain due to price fluctuations.
I can't see myself ever using PCP because I just don't like paying extra for finance when I don't have to, and I'm fine with the associated risks, and normally keep vehicles for at least a decade.",2024-04-18T00:43:40Z

No. It's done to sell dead-end combustion engines, that have no future and have terrible resale value, that should have been illegal to build, years ago.

Abolish the combustion models, and you have just one production line, and get rid of the costs of building combustion engines, gear boxes, and all the other related nonsense.
Easy.

That is why a minimum range in cars is relevant, when you want to compare usable EV's with normal ICE cars.  

The Fiat 500e is literally the only small EV with a minimum practicle use of 300km. 
Any EV that is compared with all ICE cars should be able to go on a highway and do 100kmh minimum and a 300km range.

Otherwise it is not comparible with an ICE car, but more with a city scooter with a roof.",2023-09-27T11:13:51Z

If I drive that for 15-20 years (assuming it doesn't rust away or dies in an accident), even considering fuel costs, maintenance and taxes, I'll still have more money left over than if I bought this 600e instead.

That 250km range is about the distance that people on average do on longer trips without stopping to rest anyway. So 300km real world range is needed to have a margin to find a working charger.
With 200km you'll have to look for a charger around 150km to be safe, that will become a huge bother on weekend trips. 
Charging 1 time to get to a 500km destination is reasonable. 
Looking for a charger, charge and go back on the road will take you around 45 minutes? 
But charging every 150km on a 500km trip will set you back 2.5 hours to destination and an other 2.5 hours back. That is 5 hours charging on 1 weekend trip. No fun.
So, 300km real world range should be the bare minimum when people compare EV's with ICE vehicles.

Hydrogen has a number of problems - extracting it, storing it and transporting it, for example - which mean it's unlikely to be an answer for car-sized transport, but could be good for trucks/buses and/or ships, maybe.

Synthetic fuel solves the transport problems of Hydrogen, but whilst burning synthetic fuel may be carbon neutral, it doesn't address any of the other problems (NOx, SOx and particulates, to name just three).

The only other option is you make synthetic fuel from co2 in the atmosphere. It's extremely hard to scale up and extremely electricity intensive to do, it would be worse for nearly every use case.

Synthetic fuels have just two purposes in a rational future.

1) become a source of hydrocarbon based fuels for industries that have serious physical first principle problems that prevent them being electrified...basically passenger aircraft.

2) as a luxury commodity to run in cherished historical cars of historic value or personal joy for those that can afford this inefficient use of land.

Hydrogen isn't even in the running for private vehicles and eFuels will always be for keeping classic/specialist cars alive. Hydrogen and eFuels are both limited by their efficiency to produce due to laws of thermal dynamics, they will never be as efficient as electricity, batteries and electric motors. 

Price parity for small EV's has been reached in China as battery material costs have dropped 30% this year and will continue to fall. This means medium and larger vehicles with bigger batteries will also reach price parity with ICE vehicles. 
EV's aren't the future anymore, they are already here and nothing will be able to replace them in our lifetimes.",2023-09-28T07:50:06Z

You just need to consider efficiencies and production methods and you'll always come to the same conclusion. Renewables, EV's and electric motors are the way forward. 

Hydrogen and eFuels have very specific use cases that cannot realistically be electrified. These use cases will reduce as battery tech carries on improving.

For everything else it's batteries and electric motors.",2023-09-28T08:13:42Z

Maybe for someone that is looking for a new car... But if you switch to save money... Just NO! 
But if you want a new car, the cheapest car in Europe is 13,000‚Ç¨.

I love driving fast and acceleration is thrilling, but my 13 year old Laguna gets to 60 in just over 9 seconds and that's still more than quick enough for getting out in junctions when I need it to, and the car is as quick as everybody else's on the daily commute. 9 seconds is actually more than adequate for every day driving, and if we hold every car accountable to their 0-60 prowess what hope is there for the future of the supercar?",2023-09-24T10:10:20Z

And no surprise the last decade of crossovers and premium cars have created international market wide inflation. Not just from COVID. 

All automakers as competitors not just compete who sells more, who has more market share but crucially who makes more profits. .

This business culture financing products that are the biggest purchase second to a home creates inflation. Inflation reduces the value of profits, dividends and bonuses. 

Therefore every competitor pushes up their prices, creating more market-wide inflation

John 3:16-21

16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. 21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

Mark 1.15

15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

2 Peter 3:9

The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

Hebrews 11:6

6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

2024-03-10T20:12:42Z,@glowingbunny5865,FknVzDA15bE,"Good evening  TotallyEV. I'm a recent subscriber and impressed with both your delivery and camera work/editing. I'm currently having a desperately tough time with a popular rival EV (to the 600e) which is due to be returned to it's maker and very much in the hunt for a replacement. 

I've recently road tested a Smart#1 and been blown away by...all of it really (!) but intrigued as to what the 600e might offer by way of a rival. After watching your measured review I don't think I'll be testing the 600e as it would appear not to offer the specs, room or performance of the Smart#1 and wanted to thank you for saving me the time. 

Really enjoy the content on your channel - I know it's a cliche but keep up the excellent work...",2024-03-10T20:12:42Z
2024-03-11T03:45:28Z,@TotallyEV,FknVzDA15bE,"Thank you for the kind words, glad you're enjoying the content!
The Smart is a very well rounded vehicle and one that we'd actively recommend. It is, however, more expensive than the Fiat and the ride comfort isn't as good (stiffer suspension) - so a few things to consider!",2024-03-11T03:45:28Z
2024-03-11T09:25:55Z,@glowingbunny5865,FknVzDA15bE,Hey thanks TEV! As I'm a Motorbility customer the smart is now available on their prefered EV list so luckily cost is a side issue. I can live with the ride as the quality not to mention the user interface and room is so intuitive/on another level to rivals I've tried. Look forward to the next upload...:-)@@TotallyEV,2024-04-18T02:28:03Z

2024-03-10T15:55:31Z,@billienomates1606,FknVzDA15bE,¬£30k is not affordable in my opinion. The fact that even on a 100kwh dc charger it would still take 30 mins to charge from 20% to 80% for a couple of hundred miles. My car can top up in less than a few minutes and do over 600 miles and my car only cost me ¬£1500 used many years ago and I could still sell it for ¬£1500 or even more now.,2024-03-10T15:55:31Z

2024-03-10T16:11:59Z,@DBGE001,FknVzDA15bE,"Keep your car as long as it makes sense.
Buy a second hand EV when they become affordable and total ownership cost is on par or better than you current car.",2024-03-10T16:11:59Z
