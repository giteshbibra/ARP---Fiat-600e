Using the latest platform, Fiat 600e is likely to be equipped with a single electric motorbike from Jeep Fighter which has a power of 151 dk and a torque of 260 Nm. With this performance, this car can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/hour within 9 seconds. For the interior, Fiat 600 will likely adopt the same feature as Fiat 500, including a 10.25-inch infotainment display that supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto systems. Fiat 600e has long been eagerly awaited, and after being shown in trials on the highway earlier this year, this car will eventually be here to lure car enthusiasts around the world.

While the automaker made it to fit in the B-segment, the higher ground clearance and some of its details pushed it into the crossover area. Yet, it was mainly created to tackle cobblestone roads, pavement, and curbs. It was not the car someone would choose to go in the woods. The 600e featured a front fascia that resembled the same look as its smaller sibling, the 500e. Its LD headlights sported a half-circle design. They flanked the main grille, which was mostly blocked, and on the lower bumper, the designers placed a mesh grille with a squares-pattern look. From its profile, the five-door hatchback 600e boasted black plastic moldings around the wheel arches that matched the black matte side sills. Fiat offered the vehicle with up to 18"" light-alloy wheels that created a powerful image for the little vehicle. At the back, the raked-forward tailgate was available with either a manual opening or a hands-free power one. As a final exterior detail, the 600e sported the nameplate embossed in the rear bumper adorned by the Italian flag. Fiat took the safety assistance systems very seriously, so it fitted the 600e with all the technology an urban driver would need. As a result, there was a radar behind the front bumper, in the middle of the lower grille, that helped with the adaptive cruise control or the automatic emergency braking system. For the drivetrain, Fiat offered just one choice: a 115 kW (156 HP) motor fueled by a 54 kWh battery pack. FIAT 600e 54 KWh (156 HP) For the 50th anniversary of the original Fiat 600, the Italian carmaker changed the name of the Seicento (six hundred) into 600. But it was more than that. Since Fiat introduced the Seicento in 1998, it sold 1.1 million units sold worldwide by 2005. It was a great success for the Italian brand and, somehow, it wanted to show its appreciation for the historic model 600. It wasn't just a badge on the fenders and different upholstery.  At the front, the 2005 model 600 featured the same Fiat's badge design as it was in 1955 with white on blue lettering inside a chromed ring, plus two wings on its sides. A special, limited edition, a 50th-anniversary model was also introduced. It was offered in a light tan color with unique markings on the sides. The light-alloy wheels featured a special design with eight spokes. As most of the anniversary car editions, it also featured distinct upholstery, with the Fiat logo printed on the front seats' seatbacks. Its specific colors, with light beige and gray, offered a luminous interior for the four passengers who could sit inside the car. The 600 was the smallest four-seat car on the market when it was introduced, and the 2005 model stepped on its paths. Fiat's intention was to build efficient cars with great fuel efficiency and enough ability to find parking spots where most of the other cars could just dream of. Under the hood, the 2005 600 featured a 1.1-liter four-pot engine, paired to a 5-speed manual. FIAT 600 1.1 5MT (54 HP) Two years before the first Fiat 500 Nuova rolled out of the assembly lane, Fiat introduced the 600 model, a car that redefined the family vehicle. The 600 started its career in 1955 as a replacement for the Fiat Topolino, which was on the market since 1936. But the Italian carmaker didn't have too many resources after WWII, and that made it look to the small segment. It was the first Fiat with a rear-engine, and it was its first big success after the war. While it wasn't as successful as the 500, the 600 was the car to get for four adults on a long trip. It was more than a city car. Fiat hired Dante Giacosa to design the 600. It was the same man that designed the Topolino. The Italian carmaker insisted on having a rear-engine vehicle, despite the designer being a big fan of front-wheel-drive cars. Giacosa created the vehicle big enough to fit four adults inside, but not bigger than that. The bubble-like roof was needed to offer decent headroom for the rear seat passengers. There was plenty of room in the front, anyway. The 600 featured flush to the fenders doors and rounded edges. Inside, the 600 featured a long, metallic dash panel with the speedometer installed in an instrument cluster right in front of the driver. Since the car was very narrow, the designer installed handles to close the doors and vinyl pockets. Under the dashboard, he mounted a shelf. Under the hood, Fiat installed a water-cooled four-cylinder engine that produced just 21 hp. It was paired to a 4-speed manual gearbox. FIAT 600 0.6L 4MT (21 HP)",2023-08-21,,

Relatively affordable to buy. Very useable 254-mile range. Top-spec La Prime is particularly well-equipped.
					 
Not as characterful as the little Fiat 500e. Surprising amount of road noise. We prefer the Jeep Avenger.
					 Like the look of the stylish Fiat 500e but need a little more space? The Fiat 600e is the car for you. It's a small electric SUV that's based on the same platform as the Jeep Avenger and Peugeot e-2008, while rivals include the Smart #1, Hyundai Kona Electric and MG ZS EV. While we'd dispute that the Fiat 600e is big enough to be a true family car (the Kia Niro EV or Skoda Enyaq iV would be a better bet if that's what you're after), the market for stylish small SUVs is strong and the 600e will be easier to live with than its city car relation. The Fiat 600e line-up is refreshingly simple: there are just two trim levels and no optional extras to choose from. The entry-level Fiat 600e Red covers the basics with a 10.25-inch infotainment system, rear parking sensors and climate control, while the top-spec La Prima adds such niceties as heated massage seats, diamond-cut alloys and a wireless phone charger. Scoring highly on the value for money front, the Fiat 600e is priced from around £33,000, while the range tops out at £37,000. That puts it at the budget end of the electric SUV market, undercutting the Vauxhall Mokka Electric and new Hyundai Kona Electric. The MG ZS EV is cheaper, although it lacks the style of the Fiat 600e. As such, it's not exactly a practical family car inside. Its 360-litre boot is only slightly bigger than a Volkswagen Polo's, although its relatively square shape and wide opening make access easy. Need more space? The rear seats split 60:40 and drop to provide up to 1231 litres of luggage space (provided you leave the kids at home). Fiat claims 15 litres of luggage space for odds and ends in the front. There's certainly enough stowage to stash unwanted clutter - we particularly like the huge central cubby box, with an iPad-like fold-up cover hiding things from view (something we'd like to see in the new Hyundai Kona). Prices for the new Fiat 600e Red start from £32,995, while the top-spec La Prima model is £36,995. That looks like good value alongside the Jeep Avenger and Vauxhall Mokka Electric. We’d go for the Fiat 600e La Prima if it’s within reach - this adds some desirable features, including heated front seats, integrated navigation and 18-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels. Of course, if you’re looking for a cheap electric car, you might wish to look at the MG ZS EV or other Chinese alternatives - such as the BYD Atto 3 or Ora Funky Cat. But the Fiat 600e represents impressive value for money for a very useable electric vehicle. Sharing its 54kWh battery pack with the Jeep Avenger and Peugeot e-2008, it's not surprising that the Fiat 600e pretty much matches its peers for range. If you want an EV with a long range, you might be better looking at a Tesla Model 3 or Volkswagen ID.3. The longest-range versions of each will cost a fair bit more than the Fiat 600e to buy, however, and we think the 600e's range will actually be more than enough for a lot of buyers. Charging the Fiat 600e is pretty efficient, too. It'll take around seven or eight hours to fully charge at home (using a 7kW home charger), while a 100kW public rapid charger can top it up from 20% to 80% in less than half an hour.

Let us know about your car - it will only take a few minutes and you could be helping thousands of others. The Fiat 600e is pretty unremarkable to drive, which is perhaps to be expected for a small electric SUV. The good news is that it rides well, its suspension making light work of the broken Italian roads we tested it on. The bad news is that refinement takes a knock - you can hear the suspension working away, while there's a surprising amount of road noise that makes its way into the cabin. It's not quite the refined EV driving experience we're used to. Out of town, the Fiat 600e steers, accelerates and stops in a perfectly acceptable manner. It's not engaging but it feels safe, while there's more than enough grip to keep all four wheels on the tarmac unless you do something really silly. We'd like the steering to have a little more weight (even selecting sport mode doesn't make it particularly heavy), but it's well set up for quick direction changes at city speeds. If you care about such things, 0-62mph acceleration takes around 9.0 seconds, which is slower than the new Hyundai Kona Electric. It certainly lacks the shove-you-into-your-seat excitement offered by some electric vehicles, but the Fiat 600e builds speed with little drama. It's no slower than a typical petrol small SUV. As there isn't a conventional gearbox, either, it's much easier to drive than one of those old-fashioned petrol cars with a manual gearbox. The Fiat 600e is yet to be crash-tested by Euro NCAP. Standard equipment on the Fiat 600e Red includes 16-inch steel wheels (with bi-colour covers), glossy black door mirrors, a red painted dashboard fascia, two-spoke synthetic leather steering wheel, automatic climate control, automatic lights and wipers, rear parking sensors, keyless start, a front central armrest, black recycled fabric seats with red details, LED headlights and cornering lights with cornering function, electric door mirrors, all-round electric windows, 60:40 split rear seats, six-way adjustable driver and passenger seats, Isofix child seat mounts (for the front passenger and rear seats), an electronic parking brake, cruise control, six airbags, drowsy driver detection, autonomous emergency braking, lane keeping assist, seven-inch digital instrument cluster, 10.25-inch infotainment screen with Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a four-speaker sound system. The Fiat 600e La Prima adds 18-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels, an ivory dashboard, matt black side skirts, all-round parking sensors with a 180-degree reversing camera, ivory synthetic leather seats with turquoise details (heated in the front), electrically foldable door mirrors, keyless entry and start, an auto-dimming rear-view mirror, puddle lights, automatic high/low beam, six-way adjustable driver seats with lumbar adjustment and massage function, and adjustable boot floor, hands-free power tailgate, adaptive cruise control, blind spot detection, integrated navigation, six-speaker sound system and wireless phone charger. FIAT continues to lead the way for sustainable urban mobility and presents the all-new Fiat 600e, a significant new addition to the Brand’s range that marks its return to the B-segment. And it does so by taking everything drivers and passengers love about the B-segment and upgrading it in every aspect: increased space, increased range, increased Dolce Vita feel.  Order books in the UK will open in October, with the first customer deliveries expected in Q1 2024.  FIAT 600e La Prima The electric powertrain has an output of 115 kW, and 260Nm torque, delivering acceleration from 0-62 mph in 9.0 seconds. The new Fiat 600e gives drivers the option of three driving modes – eco, normal, sport – which can be selected to match your individual styles.  The new Fiat 600e, also referred to as the all-electric Fiat 500's bigger sister, takes its name from the original 600 and brings all the Italian coolness and fresh style. Its exterior and interior design perfectly embodies the Italian beauty and Dolce Vita philosophy.  The spoiler is black to better bring out the round shapes of the 500 family and express just how dynamic it is. A 600e-chrome refreshed signature can be seen both on the front and on the sides, together with a renewed LED lighting identity.  The elegant yet dynamic exterior look is enhanced by the bigger wheels (up to 18” and a diameter of 690mm), black matt skirts and wheel arches, while the typical Italian style is also to be seen in the Italian flag in the rear bumper. Several charming features highlight its exterior lines, such as the glossy black details, chrome accents and shining cues on the rear lights. What’s new, besides an overall “electric feel”, are the several features specifically designed to offer the best pampering experience, that perfectly embodies the Italian Dolce Vita. The driver seat is equipped with power seat adjustment and a back-massage function to relax after a long trip or a busy day at work.  Fiat engineers focused on maximising legroom and roominess in the back, plus extra boot space and storage. By moving the H points, they gained an extra 30 millimetres of legroom and 22 millimetres of roominess for the people sitting in the back, thus making the new 600e a perfect vehicle for families and long trips. Getting inside has also been made easier by making the door ring 37 millimetres wider.  Another 600 millimetres have been added to the rear to maximise boot space, while the deeper curve in the rear stretches the boot space inside, resulting in best-in-class boot capacity to allow people to carry everything they love. Furthermore, the new Fiat 600e offers extra-large storage in the front.  Two driving modes help the driver with urban manoeuvres: “normal mode”, which makes things light, and the “eco mode”, which is also light on consumption, while the “sport mode” offers the best enjoyment from steering, acceleration, and power when driving out of town.  Finally, Fiat engineers have worked on efficiency and sustainability, designing an all-new motor that is 50% quieter than the previous generation. From the starting point of the 600e project, the range autonomy was improved by 25%, mainly thanks to the motor and battery evolution.  But part of the extra range is also due to extensive work on aerodynamics and weight. Inspired by the famous 500 shape which was already aerodynamic, the team of Fiat engineers has optimised every single edge to improve efficiency and reduced the 600e weight by 10% than the previous Fiat B segment generation. The new Fiat 600e is also packed with state-of-the-art safety and assistance features that make it ready for everyday life. It offers Level 2 assisted driving, bringing all the associated benefits to your journey. Perfectly suitable for those young customers looking for an ethical and eco-friendly mobility solution, the new Fiat (600e)RED represents the most accessible version of the new Fiat 600e and is a further step of a partnership with (RED) launched in 2021 from the belief that each of us can lead the change.  The new Fiat (600e)RED takes on the colour red as a hallmark, both outside from the bodywork to the front and rear logos and in dashboard fascia and design cues on the exclusive recycled fabric seats. The (RED) pad cover of the smart central tunnel serves as a further reminder of the partnership. Two more exterior colours are available to further customise it: black and white.  ",2023-09-27,,

Drawing on elements of the smaller, retro 500e to mixed results, Fiat’s first zero-emissions crossover is appealing nonetheless thanks to its cutesy looks, generously-equipped cabin and even more generous starting price. It may not be all that spacious, but neither are many of the 600e’s rivals, and while a 250-ish-mile range is nothing to write home about either, it should be more than sufficient for city buyers. If you view a car as you would a fashion accessory, the Fiat 600e is a designer handbag that’ll be sure to turn heads – just don’t expect it to be the most practical option out there. Fiat has long tried to capitalise on the hype surrounding its iconic 500 city car, resulting in a handful of disappointing Frankenstein-esque creations like the 500X crossover and 500L MPV. The Italian maker is hoping it’ll have more success in the electric age though, with the new Fiat 600e being introduced as the larger SUV sibling to what is our favourite small electric car, the Fiat 500e. So, it’s the same but bigger? Not quite; instead of sharing its parts with the smaller and similar-looking 500e, the Fiat 600e actually gets its e-CMP underpinnings from the likes of the Jeep Avenger, Vauxhall Mokka Electric, Peugeot E-2008 and DS 3 E-Tense. There may only be one battery and electric motor to choose from, but Fiat gives you two options in terms of trim levels; the base Fiat 600e Red starts from around £33,000 and is yet another collaboration with U2 frontman Bono’s charity.  Stepping up to the La Prima model costs an extra £4,000, so it’d better be worth the upgrade. Fiat certainly thinks it is, with the top-level 600e getting larger 18-inch alloys, leatherette upholstery, heated front seats with an electric, massaging driver’s seat, built-in sat nav, a wireless phone charger, adaptive cruise control, a reversing camera and a powered bootlid. 7hrs 30mins (0-100%, 7.4kW) Standard 100kW DC charging is pretty average for this class of car, although the much cheaper MG4 can top-up at speeds of up to 135kW. Find a suitable public charger and Peugeot says a 20-80% top-up will take 29 minutes. Using a standard 7.4kW home wallbox will take considerably longer, though; most homes don’t have the three-phase electrics required to make use of the 600e’s maximum 11kW AC charging speed, so at 7.4kW a full charge will take around seven-and-a-half hours. Not only should the Fiat 600e be cheap to buy, it should be inexpensive to run, too; Fiat’s electric SUV spans insurance groups 25 and 26, which is pretty much the same as its mechanical sibling, the Jeep Avenger. Charging an EV at home is much more affordable than filling a car up with petrol, too; at the time of writing, the current average electricity rate is 30p per kWh, therefore costing owners just £15 to top-up the 600e from 0-100%. Using a public rapid charger is much more expensive though, with a 10-80% charge costing owners roughly £30. The inside of the Fiat 600e is less ‘Dolce Vita’ and more ‘Deja vu’, as there’s once again plenty of similarities between the Fiat and its Jeep Avenger counterpart. Material quality is strong and the layout is generally the same across the board, with the same UConnect infotainment system – more on that in a moment – and iPad case-style centre console lid.  Fiat’s new infotainment system, while not brimming with features, is certainly better than the brand’s fiddly screens of old. Everything is logically laid out where you’d expect it to be, and the screen responds nicely to your inputs. Boot space (seats up/down) Things aren’t awful in the Fiat 600e, though; there isn’t a huge amount of head and legroom, but the plug-in Fiat SUV is more than capable of transporting four adults – taller individuals in the rear may feel a bit cramped, however. There is a third seatbelt in the back, but sitting three abreast will be a very tight squeeze and is only really feasible (and ethical!) for shorter journeys. As mentioned, the Fiat 600e sits on the tried-and-tested e-CMP platform, which should mean it’ll be reliable and easy to source parts for if something goes wrong. That’s good, as Fiats aren’t exactly known for being great in this regard; the Italian maker placed a lowly 31st out of 32 manufacturers in our 2023 Driver Power customer satisfaction survey. Only 12% of owners reported a fault with their cars within the first year of ownership – amongst the lowest in the survey – although build quality was a big sticking point.

The Red will cost you £32,995 and the La Prima is priced at £36,995 on the road.  The top spec car is the better bet if you’re after decent kit and don’t mind saying no to Bono. You get heated front seats (electrically adjustable for the driver), parking sensors all round plus a rear camera, electric folding mirrors, USB C plugs in the back, keyless entry and a powered tailgate. ",2024-03-05,,

The 600e's softish suspension does have a good appetite for big bumps and dips, mostly without getting too floaty. Corrugations will reveal some shudder, a want of high-frequency damping, but it's no disgrace. And road noise is well coddled away. If we’re being picky (and it is our job we suppose), then the steering is overly light, the only feedback from the wheel being the strong self-centring sensation and occasionally the lane keep assist.  Likewise the pedal feel on the brakes isn’t great, the car doesn’t manage a smooth transition between regen and the real thing. We found ourselves popping the car into B mode to get maximum retardation and leaving the jerky stop on the brakes to the last second. It’s probably the sort of thing that will be fine once you’ve got used to the car a bit.  Our first go in the UK was on greasy roads on a cold day and the torque steer was pretty terrible – a neat tribute to overpowered hot hatches of the early 2000s, if Fiat was continuing the retro theme. Again, Eco mode is the solution to all your ills, just take away the power until there isn’t enough to flummox the front wheels. Charge time is just over eight hours from 0 per cent to 100 on a normal 7.4kW AC outlet. If you can only get a 3.7kW at home, that doubles, of course. It actually accepts three-phase too, but only at 11kW, so the improvement isn't transformative: five hours 45 minutes. DC charging peaks at 100kW. But only peaks: it slows as the battery fills. So it's 27 minutes from 20 to 80 per cent. If real world range is 200 miles, that means adding 60 per cent of that, or 132 miles in 27 minutes. That's OK rather than brilliant.",2024-03-05,,

Then the plastics inside the 600e have been designed to be hard wearing to cope with family life. The decor is fun, a mash-up of 500 and Jeep Avenger dashboards, and we love the splash of colour about the place and the fun iPad-style cover on the central part of the dashboard.  There are plenty of places to stow away your bits and pieces, which is useful – the little shelf in the dash turns into a wireless phone charger if you upgrade to the La Prima spec car.  The driver's screen sits in a circular pod, but the actual display is jarringly rectangular, with square-edge graphics. The main touchscreen is quick-reacting, neatly populated and usefully configurable. CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, and because there are hard keys for car and climate functions it's easy to flick between the Fiat screens and the phone-mirroring ones and back again. One touchscreen-related misstep is the heated seats in the La Prima – great to have, but they’re three jabs away on the touchscreen to turn on. You’ll have frozen to death by then. The 600e is certainly an upgrade on the cramped confines of the 500e – it’s noticeably wider and more spacious up front, it’ll be reasonable for long journeys (although you can’t bring your feet back under the front seats because the battery starts right there) and you can actually get people in the back, which is nice.  You get 360 litres of space in the boot – bigger than the likes of the Jeep Avenger (321 litres) or Peugeot e-208 (311 litres), but a lot smaller than the Hyundai Kona Electric with its capacious 466 litres. There’s no frunk, mind, so you’ll have to give some precious room to the cable bag – at least in the top spec car you get a nifty double floor.",2024-03-05,,

They don’t sit on the fence. Same with their cars. The best lie at opposite ends of the spectrum. Mid-sized, mid-priced Italian cars have always flopped. But the extremes, oh yes. There’s Ferrari, a Lamborghini or a Pagani. The Italians have got supercars covered. They’re also brilliant at the bottom end. For yonks, Fiat set the small-car agenda. Think Unos and Puntos, and generations of Pandas and 500s. The 600e makes do with a smallish 51kWh. But as the motor is efficient, that’ll still take you to 220 miles in the real world. Which is probably a four-hour drive. You’ll be ready for a break yourself by then. Rapid chargers will have the 600e’s battery up and ready in half an hour. Surprisingly, the 600e uses hardly any parts from the electric 500. But it feels like the 500e. The steering is very light. Too light for me, frankly. At least it makes the handily small 600e feel like an agile terrier in tight city traffic. Acceleration is smooth and nippy in town too.  The suspension is cushty, so it doesn’t kick up a fuss on speed bumps or potholes. On motorways it stays quiet and relaxed too. Performance is plenty for a bit of outside-lane action. The only issue is the brakes. They always stop you, but the pedal is too soft when you first touch it. I want something more positive, just as I want weightier and more engaging steering. Still, the 600e has cute cabin furniture with a logical touchscreen and nice upholstery – and there’s enough room for a family of four. Who’ll be good at arguments too.",2023-09-28,,

Developed primarily for the European market, the soft-roader borrows several heritage-laced styling cues from the latest version of the 500, and it will be offered with hybrid and electric drivetrains. Visually, the 600e borrows several styling cues from the 500e, including oval headlights with LED accents. There's no ""Fiat"" emblem on the front end, the bumpers wears a ""600"" badge, while the bottom part of the bumper gets a big, body-colored air vent. The 500e influence continues out back with vertical lights. Black accents on the bumpers, wheel arches, and rocker panels add a rugged touch to the design. On sale now, the Fiat 600e will reach European showrooms in September 2023. There's no word on whether we'll see it in the United States. Related Video:  (Doing Our Best To) Drive Italy | The List

Camouflaged prototypes for the vehicle have also previously been spotted. The design shares traits with Fiat's redesigned 500e electric minicar already on sale overseas and due in the U.S. next year. The lights feature a similar treatment on both vehicles, as do the side window shapes. The video (above) shows the interior design will also be similar across both vehicles. A curved hood holds the instrument cluster, while an infotainment touchscreen display with a landscape orientation is attached to the middle of the dash. The Avenger's powertrain consists of a 156-hp motor at the front axle, a 400-volt electrical system, and a 54-kwh battery good for around 200 miles of range.

Looking to buy an electric car? Our guide to the best electric cars shows the models that excelled in our lab and road tests. Fiat has a rich history of making small cars such as the Fiat 500 and Fiat Panda, which the 600e will look to continue. It’s only slightly larger than the old Fiat Punto (which the 600e indirectly replaces) but is smaller than the current Fiat 500X SUV. Fiat intends to sell the 600e alongside the 500X for a number of years. Like the Jeep Avenger, the 600e uses a relatively small 54kWh battery, with its electric motor generating a perfectly usable 154hp. It also promises a range of up to 254 miles, which is slightly more than the Avenger. A petrol mild-hybrid version of the 600 will be released in 2024. We show you how much it costs to charge an EV in our guide. Fiat has made great efforts to create a small yet spacious SUV, and for the most part they’ve been successful. During our initial test drive we found it had plenty of headroom for both front and rear passengers, while the boot is also a useful size. Even though the 600e has only 154hp at its disposal, there’s still enough power to allow for sufficient, if not startling, acceleration. It doesn’t let up at high speeds either, although the responsiveness of the electric motor is noticeably dulled in Eco mode. The other two driving modes (Normal and Sport) are more responsive but at the expense of driving range. It’s also very quiet to drive as barely any annoying motor noise makes its way into the cabin, and both road and wind noise are limited. There’s a fair amount of lean into bends, but this is to be expected from an SUV. And while straight-line stability is good, the steering’s centre position could be defined better to improve driving precision. The brakes are surprisingly light - we found the pedal needed a fair shove when slowing down in short distances. You can select a regenerative braking function, but this too is quite light, meaning one-pedal driving (where you brake simply by lifting your foot off the accelerator) isn’t really an option. We also noticed that one of the rear headrests rattled whenever we drove quickly during our test drive, which soon became annoying. The SUV-like ride height and wide door openings of the 600e make it easy to get in and out of the front. Getting into the back is also reasonably easy, although the door opening is slightly smaller and the rear wheel-arch eats into the available space slightly. Tall drivers may be affected by the relatively small footwell area in the front, depending on your preferred driving position. As ever, we’ll provide our own figures on both cabin and boot space once we’ve lab tested the 600e. The Fiat 600e hasn’t been crash tested by Euro NCAP yet. Plenty of safety kit is offered, with all versions featuring six airbags, lane keep assistance, cruise control and autonomous emergency braking (AEB). Fiat doesn’t have a great reputation for dependability and the 600e doesn’t entirely banish this. The leatherette folding cover on the centre cubby hole doesn’t feel particularly durable, while the colour-coded plastic insert on the top of the dash feels cheap and scratchy to touch (notably cheaper than in the 500e).  Cons:  Steering lacks feel, brakes are quite light, limited rear legroom Get the power of Which? in your pocket by downloading our app, giving you on-the-go access to our reviews",2023-10-01,,

Thirteen years later, the Italian marque has revived the nameplate - but this time, with an electric twist.   Meet the all-new Fiat 600e. It may have the same name as its predecessor, but the similarities end there. The latest iteration of this iconic model boasts a fresh design and advanced technology in the form of a practical five-door crossover.   The Fiat 600e can seat five and hold cargo up to 12.7 cubic feet. The cabin features a seven-inch digital instrument cluster, a 10.25-inch Uconnect infotainment system with wireless Apple Carplay and Android Auto, and a six-speaker sound system. It also has an electric tailgate, automatic climate control, adaptive cruise control, auto emergency braking, and parking sensors for added safety and convenience.   With support for 100 kW charging, the 600e can recharge quickly to 80 percent in less than half an hour. Fiat says a hybrid powertrain option will join the 600e lineup next year. Unlike the all-wheel-drive Jeep Avenger, the Fiat 600e is exclusively offered as a front-wheel-drive EV.   Pricing ranges from €35,950 (around $39,100) for the Red version to €40,950 (~$44,450) for the top-spec La Prima trim. Production of the 600e has already started at the Tychy plant in Poland.  Nissan has confirmed that the next GT-R will have certain ""Godzilla"" elements – whatever that means. The K8, the replacement to the Cadenza, is being updated and will adopt Kia's 'Opposites United' design philosophy.  If you're taking delivery of a new R1T or R1S, you may be disappointed with Rivian's latest tech-biased decision.

A tribute to the Fiat 600e‘s country of origin is the Italian flag on the rear bumper. The Fiat 600e is equipped with a 54 kWh battery and a maximum power of 115 kW (156 HP), enabling acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h in 9 seconds. Depending on the situation and desired driving style, drivers can choose between ECO, NORMAL, and SPORT driving modes.

Fiat has made two variants available: the base (600e)RED model and the higher-spec La Prima version. Prices start at €35,950 in Italy (just over $63,000). We think there's a good chance for a New Zealand release, as the 500e has just gone on sale at a starting price of $59,990 (before the Clean Car Discount).

The family hatchback and estate versions of the Tipo will be indirectly replaced by the new 600e electric crossover. With the Tipo’s demise, that leaves just the 500 and the Panda as Fiat’s only non-SUV cars available in the UK. Experts say though the Tipo was never a key part of Fiat’s UK business, as it was vastly outsold by its city car siblings and the 500X crossover. However, it will remain available to order in other markets around the world. Retailing from £32,995 it will be a rival to the Kia Niro EV and the Volvo EX30. The Tipo first went on sale in 2015 and before being axed cost from £28,745 or a 4x4-inspired Cross form which retailed form £29,245. In 2021, Fiat also produced a version of the Tipo with a mild-hybrid powertrain but there was also a pure-petrol engine with 93bhp.

At 164.1 inches long, though, it's 3.1 inches shorter than the current gasoline Fiat 500X crossover. Inside, the 600e offers a respectable 12.7 cubic feet of cargo space, augmented by interior storage areas up front, including in a central tunnel. The 600e also has expected tech features like a 10.3-inch touchscreen 7.0-inch digital instrument cluster, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity, and driver aids like adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, and driver attention monitoring.

""In recent years, Fiat needed to collaborate with other automakers for new products such as the 124 Spider [with Mazda], the Fullback pickup [with Mitsubishi] and the Tipo family [with Tofas in Turkey],"" he said. During those lean years when Fiat failed to get new products approved because of a lack of volume or access to the proper underpinnings it missed out on making some models.

Unveiled at the 2019 Geneva auto show, the Centoventi highlighted ideas to ""make electric mobility accessible to everybody,"" Francois said at time.

It gets styling that draws heavy inspiration from the latest Fiat 500, including its semicircle headlights and clamshell-style bonnet, and uses the same underpinnings as found in the new Jeep Avenger. The 600e’s interior gets a round digital instrument cluster like in the 500, but with a similar central touchscreen infotainment system. As a whole, its cabin appears more restrained and less retro-inspired than the 500 city cars. It’s a slightly more minimalist design, with just a few heating and climate control buttons sitting beneath the central screen. Entry-level 600e Red models will be available as standard in the colour red, although customers can also order it in black or white. These cars get 16-inch steel wheels with covers in contrasting colours. All cars also get a synthetic leather steering wheel, auto climate control, auto wipers and lights, rear parking sensors, keyless go, seats made from recycled fabric, LED headlights and taillights, electric door mirrors and windows, and safety kit such as driver fatigue monitoring, traffic sign recognition, autonomous emergency braking tech, and lane keep and speed limit assist. The 600e’s powertrain lineup is simple – it gets just one electric motor option: a 154bhp unit powering the front wheels and giving it a 0-62mph time of nine seconds. Drivers can choose from three driving modes: ‘eco’, ‘normal’ and ‘sport’. Order books will open from October 2023 in the UK, with first deliveries due at the beginning of 2024.

Fiat will sell the New 600e in Europe only. It has no plans to export the EV to the U.S. or Brazil, where sales are slow for the New 500 full-electric hatchback. Fiat opened orders on Wednesday for two editions, (RED) and La Prima, with the first deliveries due in Italy in September. In Italy, the (RED) starts at 35,950 euros and the La Prima at 40,950 euros, without incentives. Fiat CEO Olivier Francois said that with state scrapping incentives and discounts from the automaker, the (RED) variant will start as low as 29,500 euros in France, Germany and Italy. Since both variants have a high level of standard content, the only choice customers make is to pick the color. The Fiat New 600e, shown, is a sibling model to the outdoor-focused Jeep Avenger. Fiat considers the New 600e as the big sister to the electric-only New 500 minicar. The 600e's front end, including headlights partly covered by the hood, are reminiscent of the New 500, while the rear-end design is closely influenced by the 500X. The New 600e was homologated under the WLTP mixed cycle for an energy efficiency of 15.1 to 15.2 kWh/100 km (depending on version) and a range of 406 to 409 km (252 to 254 miles). Urban driving range is 591 to 604 km. Zero to 100 kph (0-62 mph) takes 9 seconds. The (RED) edition, named for a nonprofit group that partners with brands to raise money to fight AIDS and other pandemics, has red trim inside and out. Fiat says it is a “more accessible” version, aimed at young buyers who want an ethical and eco-friendly mobility solution. There is also a New 500 (RED) model. La Prima is the top of the range and is available in four colors that Fiat says recall Italian beauty and natural landscapes: Sun of Italy, Sea of Italy, Earth of Italy, Sky of Italy.",2023-07-04,,

And it does so by taking everything you love about the B-segment and upgrading it in every aspect: increased space, increased range, increased Dolce Vita feel. Simply put, the New Fiat 600e takes the best of the B and B-SUV worlds to offer a beautiful, joyful, and pampered driving experience. Following the success of its predecessor and best-seller the Fiat 600 from the ‘50s, also renowned as the family mover, the New Fiat 600e places itself in the heart of the fast-growing B segment. Available in 2 different full-electric versions, New Fiat 600e La Prima and New Fiat (600e)RED, it is a family friendly solution to fully experience pure Italian Dolce Vita, with an eye to the environment and a care for social causes. The New Fiat 600e, also referred to as the 500e’s bigger sister, takes its name from the original 600 and brings all the Italian coolness and fresh style. Its exterior and interior design perfectly embodies the Italian beauty and Dolce Vita philosophy. In short, the New Fiat 600e offers a truly sensorial pleasure as rooted in Italian’s DNA. Compared to the New 500, its augmented look features a sharper and more assertive face, a 600-chrome refreshed signature both on the front and on the sides, and a renewed LED lighting identity. The elegant yet dynamic exterior look is enhanced by the bigger wheels (up to 18” and a diameter of 690mm), black matt skirts and wheel arches, while the typical Italian style is also to be seen in the Italian flag in the rear bumper. Several charming features highlight its exterior lines, such as the glossy black details, chrome accents and shining cues on the rear lights. The New Fiat 600e is also packed with state-of-the-art safety and assistance features that make it ready for everyday life. It offers level 2 assisted driving, bringing all the associated benefits to your journey. The New Fiat (600e)RED takes on the color red as a hallmark, both outside – from the bodywork to the front and rear logos, – and in – dashboard fascia and design cues on the exclusive recycled fabric seats. The (RED) pad cover of the smart central tunnel serves as further reminders of the partnership. Two more colors are available to further customize it: black and white.

As expected, the novelty is made in the style of the new generation FIAT 500e and at the same time replaces the FIAT 500X model.

That is, there will be no more “arrows running in circles”. First, the electric car FIAT 600e, which is built on the СМР/еСМР platform, enters the market – this means the use of an electric motor with a capacity of 115 kW (156 hp) and a battery of 54 kWh, which should be enough for 400 km of power reserve.

It just makes you look like a Canute. Hyundai has led on EVs, that’s why its second-generation Hyundai Kona Electric is battling first-generation e-SUVs from Fiat and Honda. While the Kona’s drivetrain shares much with its predecessor – carryover electric motors, two battery sizes – the vehicle architecture is new. And it’s significantly bigger: this Kona measures 4355mm-long, a 150mm growth spurt, and there’s an extra 60mm between the wheels to boost interior space. The larger platform – designed for electric vehicles first although it supports petrol and hybrid too – means the previous entry-level model’s 39.2kWh pack can be upgraded to 48.6kWh. Prices start at £34,995 or £38,595 for the biggest battery. Let’s start by driving the £36,995 La Prima edition Fiat on the roads around Danish coastal town Tversted. The 600e’s curvaceous rump, botoxed lips and headlamp treatment engender a strong 500 resemblance. Or is that a Garfield the cat resemblance? The orange paint and lidded ‘lamps are straight off the sleepy cartoon character,’ reckons photographer Tom Salt, and once seen it simply can’t be unseen. You sit low in a very car-like position, on ivory synthetic leather seats with powered adjustment and inadjustable Fiat logos stitched all over. And I thought head restraints embossed with mainstream brand crests showed delusions of grandeur… The 0-62mph acceleration sprint takes 9.0sec, more than a second slower than the Honda or Hyundai. It’s not that the Fiat feels sluggish; the 115kW (154bhp) electric motor has sufficient low-down shove to feel sprightly in isolation and has more than enough to joust with city traffic. But the bigger, heavier Asian SUVs just have more punch out of rural Denmark’s high-speed corners and pile on pace when the speed limit relaxes. The Fiat has the quietest e-motor and motorway refinement though, suppressing tyre grumble and wind noise smartly. Over our test loop mixing urban trundling, fast rural roads and highway speed stretches, the 600e averaged 3.70 miles per kWh consumed. That’s not too far off the 4.09 miles per kWh official WLTP figure, which also calculates the maximum range to be 252 miles. Our testing pegs range at about 190 miles in the real world. A standard heat pump will boost efficiency; the maximum charge rate on DC public chargers is 100kW. There’s a series of fast, open corners scything through the green fields. Into the sweeping 70mph left-hander, the Kona sways outward nonchalantly, the nose clinging on effortlessly. There are similar good vibes through a slower chicane created by traffic calming measures: the responsiveness just off the dead-ahead makes the Kona jink through kinks more deftly. The Kona Electric has the best braking system. Pedal feel is crisp, but it’s the four-tier regenerative braking that provides the trio’s most engagement and flexibility. It’s familiar from multiple Hyundai and Kia EVs, and baffling that more car makers haven’t stolen its functionality. Simply crank the left paddle to increase the regenerative force in steps, with the fourth setting being i-Pedal and prodigious deceleration the instant you step off the accelerator enabling one-pedal driving. Dial back the force with the right paddle. You can choose which tier suits you best and the Kona stays in that setting, but with the click of a paddle you can swiftly add or subtract braking force as you approach a corner. It’s a game the Fiat doesn’t really try to play, and the Honda just messes up.   The Kona’s ride feels more taut than the Fiat’s, and it fidgets and rumbles more over the ravaged tarmac entering the town of Bindslev but glides smoothly over the speed bumps. Accelerating from 40mph to motorway speeds, wind noise around the screen builds and the tyres murmur; the 600e has the edge on refinement. The less successful stuff? The speaker adjoining the digital driver’s binnacle looks like a poverty-spec blanked off area, the lidded central cubbyhole has an odd open design making it useless for hiding valuables and there are a bewildering number of switches.  Pull away and you’re assailed by electric motor whine, with the 150kW (201bhp) unit summoning a meaty 229lb ft of grunt. The engineers have limited torque delivery under 10mph for smoother getaways, but the Honda is still the punchiest on test with occasional torque steer and squealing tyres if you’re a bit careless with the ‘loud pedal’. And it really is a loud pedal when that mewling motor takes it up a notch under acceleration. The e:Ny1 sounds the loudest at motorway speeds, with the greatest wind noise and that always-on chirrup. Honda must have orchestrated that e-motor sound to boost driver engagement, but with more whine than Italy’s Veneto region it’s irritating at a cruise and wearisome around town. And the firm Honda is the most troubled over Bindslev’s scarred surfaces, with the tyres rumbling away as they transmit a wave of jiggles to the cockpit, and crash through the odd pothole. Speed bumps can induce head toss too. In our testing the Honda managed 3.3 miles per kWh, which would give it a 204-mile range. Officially the e:Ny1 covers 3.41 miles per kWh and 256 miles in total. Maximum DC charging is 78kW: that may sound outgunned by its peers, but Honda says the lower figure enables a more consistent charging peak, to replenish the battery from 10 to 80 percent in 45 minutes.   On straight-line performance, the e:Ny1 narrowly beats the Hyundai, but its steering and dynamics aren’t as involving. Which leaves Honda’s trump card to be the nicest cabin with lots of space and the plushest materials, but rightly so given it’s just £6k less than a basic Porsche Macan. The Honda takes the bronze medal in our Hyundai Kona Electric vs Fiat 600e vs Honda e:Ny1 test. That said it’s simple to use and proved the most efficient on our loop, assisted by its lighter weight and smaller frontal area. This package will be just right for some punters but they’ll have to choose between the cutesy Fiat and the tougher Jeep. The new Kona Electric is instantly identifiable despite its useful growth spurt. It sharpens the Mk1’s bulging wheelarches with light clusters sliding off like eggs out of the frying pan and retains the untidy charge socket sticking out like a sore nose. If you’re looking for a nicely sorted front-wheel drive e-crossover, ink the Hyundai Kona Electric onto your consideration list.

It’s something made all the more exciting by my natural disposition towards anything Italian. But first, we should take a more objective look. The 600e is Fiat’s new crossover, adding two more doors and a touch more capability to the popular 500e city car to create a model that sits above it in the brand’s line-up.  The effort to separate Fiat from Jeep, particularly in our La Prima model, is fairly convincing, even if there is a whiff of ‘Spag Bol’ about it; as any Italian knows, there is no such thing as Spaghetti Bolognese in Italy.  Yet while the details are sound, the overall design is potentially a little less convincing. In contrast to the smaller 500e, which has a deft touch to its volumes, bodywork, slick proportions and elegant detailing, the 600 is somewhat more cumbersome. Its oversized headlights and awkward silhouette look less like an upsized version of the 500e – as was planned – and more like an inelegant copy designed by an adjacent team via Google Translate.  Additions on the La Prima edition include some plush-looking ivory leather seats with contrasting teal piping and embroidery, plus a matching ivory dash insert and the not exactly ambiguously named ‘Sea of Italy’ blue paintwork. There’s also a powered tailgate, wireless phone charging, a set of ornate 18-inch alloy wheels and a bunch of exterior brightwork and tricolores that help lift the Fiat’s basic styling.  This is on top of the standard equipment levels found in all 600e models, including a rather narrow but smart-looking 10-inch touchscreen display, dual-zone climate control, adaptive cruise control, LED headlights and dark-tint windows from the B-pillar back. All in, the 600e’s price is £36,995 which, for a limited time, will be offered alongside a £3,000 rebate directly from Fiat, bringing it down to £33,995. All of which leads us to some initial thoughts. The Fiat’s range, and its efficiency in town, are already impressing me. At the end of most urban journeys I’ve seen up to six miles per kWh, which is very good. I’m also liking the general driving set-up, which feels well suited to slow-speed driving, and makes short work of the sometimes appalling state of the roads of the capital.  However, does the 600e truly feel Italian? Some evidence suggests this might be the case, but it’s maybe not in the positive sense you thought I was alluding to. That’s another thing to delve into over the next six months. *Insurance quote from AA (0800 107 0680) for a 42-year-old in Banbury, Oxon, with three points.

                            The next-gen Fiat Panda may be unveiled as a cheap and cheerful crossover as early as summer 2024                         Although reports suggest that the existing Fiat Panda will soldier on until 2026, plans for its successor are in motion. The next-gen Panda is expected to be revealed in 2024, as a “less is more” crossover that aims to take on the likes of the cheap and cheerful Dacia Sandero. Fiat first showed off what it had planned for the future of the model with the Centoventi concept car that was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in 2019. That car was said to share its underpinnings with the recently released 600e, and is one of three crossovers the brand is planning by 2027. Read: Fiat To Unveil A New Supermini And Three New Crossovers By 2027 That suggests that, while the Fiat 600e will have style and content to make it appeal to well-heeled buyers, the next-gen Panda will be aimed at budget-conscious customers in the market for something “simple” and “clever,” which Francois describes as being “a little bit like the Panda used to be.” “We need something that is 100% following the European tastes but really can be global,” said Francois. “And this is why I said there may be space for something else, other than the 600 [in the B-segment], which is very, very European.”",2023-07-06,,

It has also been fitted with 100kW fast-charging capability, meaning the 600e can also be charged from 0 to 80 per cent in less than half an hour. For drivers using a normal 11kW domestic charger, the 600e will take less than six hours to fully charge. Inside is a futuristic interior, seating for five people and a 360-litre boot, accessible at the rear. The 600e will be available in two specifications – La Prima and (RED) with both versions highlighted with chrome ‘600’ badging at the front and on the sides. Other exterior highlights include LED headlights, while matt-black wheel arches give it more presence. There’s also an Italian flag motif in the rear bumper. (RED) specification models get the team’s hallmark exterior colour both inside and outside, although buyers can also choose from black and white shades. La Prima versions, meanwhile, can be specified in one of four colours. Inside, the 600e features electric seat adjustment with a back massage function, as well as wireless smartphone charging and a number of USB and USB-C charging points for topping up devices. Fiat has also included a number of assistance systems in the 600e, such as adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking and 360-degree parking sensors with a rear-view camera. A 10.25-inch infotainment screen provides access to navigation and media functions, while both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included as standard, too. Prices are expected to start below the most expensive 500e, so expect a circa £30,000 price tag when the car goes on sale in September ahead of deliveries later in the winter.

Literally, the brand has decided the color grey is simply too boring to ever be worn by another one of its vehicles ever again, and to show how serious it is, the automaker dunked its CEO, Olivier Francois, in a vat of orange paint, shielding his suit from damage by putting him in the as-yet-unrevealed Fiat 600e to do so.   That's a lot of options to choose from, but it still gives you the option of black or white if you're feeling boring the day you head to the Fiat dealer. Colorful cars are just better. We believe if you're going out of your way to buy a car as quirky as a Fiat, you simply must get it in a color that will make you smile every time you walk up to it. The brand certainly wants you to, and they're hoping all the publicity will translate into more orders for the return of the 500e to America.   ""We broke the rules: we decided to stop the production of Fiat grey cars,"" says Francois. ""This is challenging and disruptive and it is aimed to further reinforce Fiat's leadership as the Brand of joy, colors, and optimism. Fiat wants to inspire people to live with optimism and positivity and this will also be one of the missions of the new Fiat 600e, the electric for families and friends, which will be presented on 4th July"".   Let's hope this leads to more colorful and creatively designed Fiats driving around in the future, something that's good for the soul, really.   An interesting tidbit Fiat decided to throw at us, though, is that apparently, grey is the most popular color for cars in the UK, with one in four sold painted that color. For some reason, this feels very appropriate, and it's a sad day for all those British Fiat fans hoping to scoop up a grey one in the near future.  Nissan has confirmed that the next GT-R will have certain ""Godzilla"" elements – whatever that means. The all-new A6 e-tron will be unveiled tomorrow in both sedan and wagon guises.

But it won't be cheap. Fiat has relaunched the 600 nameplate some 68 years after it was first introduced... The Italian marque's decision to use the 600 moniker on an EV of this type will be confusing to those who remember the originals. The 600 started life in 1955 as a rear-engine, water-cooled city car aimed at the masses.  A year later, it used the same number configuration for its 600 Multipla - a four-door mini people carrier designed to transport families on a budget. But the new 600e fails to reflect either of the segments the original 600 represented.  A year later, the Italian brand introduced the 600 Multipla - a small MPV aimed at families on a budget The new 600e is unlike either of the classics it shares a name with. Instead, it's a jacked-up small crossover aimed at city lovers and outdoor enthusiasts Instead, Fiat is looking to capitalise on the popularity of small SUV models with the 600e a jacked-up hatchback aimed at 'both city lovers and outdoor enthusiasts'. Yet Fiat refers to it as an all-new model that it describes as 'the perfect embodiment of the brand's values of Italian style and sustainability'.  Alternatively, the 11kW onboard charger means a homecharger should boost the battery to 100 per cent in less than six hours. Order books for UK customers open in the autumn and first deliveries are due before the end of 2024. However, Fiat has yet to confirm pricing for British showrooms Fiat calls it the 500e's 'bigger sister' and says it reflects the 'coolness and fresh style' of the original 600. Order books are due to open for UK customers from this autumn, with first deliveries estimated for the end of the year. With the 500e city car priced from £28,195, the larger 600e will start from £32,995 in Britain from early 2024.   Share what you think This 11kW on board charger, does this mean it has a three pin plug so the vehicle can charge at any wall socket, sounds a bit fishy to me.

Although Fiat says that a hybrid version will be made available at a later date, for now the 600e is offered with just one powertrain, which delivers 154 hp (115 kW/156 PS) to the road.

The EV is more focused on delivering la Dolce Vita to its customers. To start, it will be offered in a base model, the do-gooder (600e)RED trim, and the top-of-the-line La Prima trim. Meanwhile, the La Prima model offers more design freedom for aesthetes. Available with just four exterior colors, they are all inspired by the crossover’s country of origin: Italian Sun Orange, Italian Sea Green, Italian Land Sand, and Italian Sky Blue. In addition, the model will be available with electric adjusting seats that have heating and massaging functions. For the La Prima model, they are upholstered in Ivory synthetic leather with turquoise accents. Prices for the Fiat (600e)RED start at €35,950 ($39,176 USD) before incentives, while the 600e La Prima starts at €40,950 ($44,625 USD) in Italy.

The 600 Hybrid accelerates from 0-62 mph (100 km/h) in a leisurely 11 seconds. In addition, the motor can be used while the vehicle is stuck creeping along in traffic or while it’s parking to keep the engine from burning fuel unnecessarily. Like the 2024 Fiat 600e, the 600 Hybrid measures in at 164 inches (4.17 meters) in length and has 915 cubic inches (15 liters) of storage throughout the cabin, in addition to a 13.5 cubic foot (385-liter) trunk. It also has seating for five passengers, who can rest on exclusive recycled fabric upholstery with white accents. The black bio-based plastic dashboard fascia helps further hint at the vehicle’s environmental ambitions.

Fiat just dunked a 600e crossover in a vat of orange paint with its CEO inside. It’s a stunt that puts huge faith in door seals, but also one that raises a big question: Why? See, Fiat is thoroughly done with grey, and a bold cause sometimes requires a bold statement. Consider this a declaration of war on an important part of the German rainbow. While Fiat is unique in its anti-gray crusade, other manufacturers are giving bright colors a helping hand. BMW has been expanding the reach of its extended Individual palette of colors to include limited shades at plants not set up for the full program. For instance, the San Luis Potosi plant where the M2 is made isn’t ready for full Individual yet, but the M2 will soon be available in Frozen Portimao Blue, a matte medium blue that’s a bit off-the-wall. At the same time, Porsche’s PTS extended color palette has soared to new popularity in recent years, and the bright fuchsia Ruby Star Neo color has made it onto the standard color menu for 911s and 718s. What’s more, automotive paint giant BASF reports that the tides may be starting to gently shift in regard to grayscale colors. In 2022, chromatic colors gained overall market share, with violet emerging as an unlikely winner of 2022. Admittedly, these aren’t huge gains, but a win is a win. It should go without saying, but do not try Fiat’s stunt at home. A little bit of liquid is fine, but cars just aren’t made to be submersible. Spray water on a car, and you might clean it. Dunk a car in water, and you’ll probably total it. However, sacrificing a pre-production car that most likely had a non-registerable VIN for the sake of art is always a good idea. If it needs to be destroyed for legal reasons anyway, you might as well do something fun with it. (Photo credits: Fiat, BMW, Thomas Hundal, BASF) Got a hot tip? Send it to us here.

A whole new generation of motorists fell in love with the little city car and it sold in the millions – reversing years of financial decline. Yes, the epic 600 – which embodied the Dolce Vita philosophy – is back to inject a bit of colour in our lives. Measuring 4.17 metres in length, it’s considerably bigger than its sibling and boasts enough room for a family of five, with 15 litres of interior storage and a boot with up to 385 litres. Inside, it’s a masterclass in Italian chic, with bold colours in the upper dash that match the folding sassiness of the centre console. Above it are four separate buttons instead of a gear select. There are USB type A and C ports, a wireless charger for smartphone and keyless entry. Other goodies include level-­two assisted driving with adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking and drowsy driver detection. There are three trim levels to choose from – Hybrid, Dolce Vita and La Prima – and a whole range of funky colours including our favourite, sunset orange. We tested both versions in Citywest and although the test drives were 30-minute slots, we left more than impressed. The hybrid preformed exceptionally well and was not left wanting for power – a weak link with most of its ilk, but not here. The EV (available in Red and La Prima spec) felt a tad more responsive, as you’d expect, and because of the even weight distribution handled like a go-kart, while straight-line acceleration was awesome. The only gripe was the raised floor in the petrol, which I’m sure you probably wouldn’t notice after a while, and tight legroom in the rear with a six-footer driving. The new Fiat 600 is available to order now, with prices starting from €28,995 for the 600 Hybrid and from €32,995 for the fully electric 600e. It was only fitting that Jeep chose New York to launch its first global battery-electric vehicle – the Wagoneer S. The mid-sized SUV boasts a range of more than 600km on a single charge, bangs out 600bhp, 800Nm of torque and will sprint from 0-100kmh in less than four seconds. It also promises proper off-road capability, with an exclusive Selec-Terrain traction management system, and features five distinct driving modes: Auto, Sport, Eco, Snow and Sand. Powering this monster is a 100kWh battery pack that allows owners to charge the vehicle from 20 to 80pc in 23 minutes (with 150kWh DC fast charger). Despite the fact that it’s no longer needed to allow airflow and cooling, the new model will have the iconic seven-slat grille, which is now back-lit. With a sloping roofline, deep rear spoiler and flush door handles, the new crossover also has a drag coefficient of 0.29 – the lowest ever for a Jeep and around 15pc better than the average SUV. Inside, it promises to be a tech lover’s dream, with a best-in-class usable screen space of more than 45 inches. This is made up of a 12.3in driver cluster, a 12.3in centre display and a 10.25in front interactive passenger display. They are home to the more than 170 standard safety and security features, including collision avoidance with advanced driver-assist tech and full surround colour camera. The little hot hatch gets a much more aggressive look, with sharper lines, new slimmer headlights and a wider kidney grille. The number one is embossed in the C-pillar, while at the rear, revised 3D light clusters and a new bumper give it a meatier feel. Engine-wise, the diesel offering is no longer, with just two petrols — the 120, a 1.5-litre three pot with mild hybrid tech (168bhp), and the mega M135 with 300bhp.

We've driven the 600e EV to find out if it's worth the £33,000 outlay - or if you should hold tight for the hybrid to hit showrooms. Fiat's new electric family car: The 600e has arrived in the UK with enough range to take owners from London to Middlesbrough in one hit. But is the new EV too pricey for Britons? The original Fiat 600 was launched in 1955 and sold 23 million across Europe before being discontinued in 1969.  But my word, how it has grown since.  That early car measured just 3.12m. The new 600e is 4.17m and sits between two previous models – the Fiat Punto (4.07m) and the Fiat 500X SUV (4.27cm), marking Fiat's return to the 'B-sector' of mid-range cars.  But looking at Fiat's restricted range of new models today, the 600e should be considered the bigger sibling of the flagship Fiat 500 electric car. It aims to capture much of that fun but in a bigger, more practical, package that appeals to families. The 600e should be considered the bigger sibling of the flagship Fiat 500 electric car. It aims to capture much of that fun but in a bigger, more practical, package that appeals to families Stats at a glace: The 600e can accelerate to 62mph in 9 seconds, hit a top speed of 93mph and has a claimed range of 254 miles The 154hp all-electric 600e with a 54kWh battery accelerates from rest to 62mph in 9 seconds up to a top speed of 93mph. With a range of up to 254 miles, it could - theoretically - get you from London to Middlesbrough on a single charge. Though we are mindful that 'official' range figures need to be taken with a pinch of salt - and the mileage claim is also impacted by seasonal conditions. The 600e will be available in the UK in two trim levels. The base 600e Red starts from £32,995 while the higher-specced 600e La Prima - which is the model we drove at launch - rings in from £36,995. So it's fair to say that the 600e isn't cheap.  But Fiat offer its own £3,000 'e-grant' contribution – effectively a discount - to customers buying its pure electric EV cars, including the 600e.   It's a two-finger salute to the government, which still has very little in terms of grants towards EVs and homechargers, despite ministers' desperate need to boost electric car sales to meet their clean-air targets. With the e-grant considered, it brings the price paid down to £29,995 and £33,995, respectively. This makes the 600e one of the most affordable family-size EVs in the UK, though is still some £4,000 pricier than the MG4. The base 600e Red starts from £32,995 while the higher-specced 600e La Prima - which is the model we drove at launch - rings in from £36,995 While those prices sound steep, Fiat has an 'e-grant' available to customers, which slashes the cost of a new electric model by £3,000. It's a two-finger salute to the UK Government, which still offers little in incentive towards buying an EV today Range from a full charge: 252 miles 11kW AC (to 100 per cent) wall-charger: 5 hours 45 minutes 100kW DC (to 80 per cent) raid charger: 27 minutes 3.7kW AC to 100 per cent: 16 hours 10 minutes Though an Italian brand - with the Italian flag proudly flying on the rear bumper - the 600e is actually built in Poland, where Fiat has long-standing links. It has three driving modes: 'Normal' for cruising; a frugal 'Eco' mode; and, finally, 'Sport', which sharpens the throttle response for the most sprightly sensation. In the latter mode, the 600e feels surprisingly engaging at the wheel, especially when taking into account this is a family runaround. There are some lovely design touches, too. This includes the flip and fold cover on the centre console storage cubby hole which mirrors that of an iPad.  And it has proper physical buttons for air-con. Bellissimo! This includes adaptive cruise control, traffic sign and speed limit recognition (vital with so many 20mph zones), autonomous emergency braking, lane departure warning, pedestrian and cyclist detection an. Spec up to the La Prima and you even get blind spot detection, a rear view 180 degree camera and semi-autonomous Level 2 driving capability. As for space, the back seats are roomy enough for two adults, while the boot's 380-litres of luggage space is on par with a Volkswagen Golf.  There are some lovely design touches, too, Ray says. This includes the flip and fold cover on the centre console storage cubby hole which mirrors that of an iPad While car buyers will mostly be impressed by the safety kit on offer, not everyone will be taken with Fiat's standard colour options. The Italian marque claims its new 'La Dolce Vita' philosophy to bring a more colourful, chirpier tone to the roads is why its - free - standard paint is orange. It says this is to represent the Italian sun, while sceptics will says it's an ingenious way to make customers pay extra for a less eccentric tone. The £600 optional paints include stone, blue and green, which reflect Italy's earth, sky and sea, apparently.  And grey is banished entirely for being too dull. While Fiat's endeavours to brighten up Britain's roads can be saluted, it's a very bold move to not offer the most popular UK new car car colour for the last six years running.  In 2023, more than a quarter (26.8 per cent) of all new cars were grey, which represents over half a million sales.   While grey is off limits, both black and white (Britain's second and third most popular new car colours) are among the £600 options. And while we're talking about necessary extras, an enhanced charging cable is also a £400 option. Boo!  While we were impressed with how well the 600e drove and its practicalities, there is a petrol-power fly in the ointment.  The new 600 was originally intended only as an electric car. However, concerned that sales generally of pure electric cars to private buyers have plateaued – and even fallen – Fiat has taken a decision to add a mild hybrid option to the line up. A shortage of public charging points and the removal of government EV grants from private buyers has added to this problem, says Fiat.  Or put another way, the political class who 'talk the talk' are failing to 'walk the walk' on matters of electrification. Having marched the motor industry up the hill of switching to electric cars and banning petrol and diesel from 2030, the politicians and campaigners failed to account for real actual consumers being luke-warm on the idea and failing to buy what is being produced in sufficient numbers. The Fiat 600e's boot offers 380-litres of luggage space. This is on par with a Mk8 Volkswagen Golf So is the hybrid a better choice for Britons for the time-being? The last stepping-stone to full electrification in 2035, maybe?  Well, on price alone, the 600 Hybrid does seem better value. It will cost from £23,965 on the road and the top of the range 600 Hybrid La Prima from £26,965. That is a difference of £10,030 on the price of range-topping La Prima electric and hybrid models. The new 100 horsepower 600 Hybrid marries a frugal 1.2-litre 3-cylinder petrol engine to a 21hp electric motor and a 1KW battery, linked to a 6-speed automatic gearbox.  Acceleration is no match for the 600e, stomping from 0 to 62mph is 10.9 seconds (1.9 seconds slower). Buy now or pay less for a 600 Hybrid later? Ray Massey gives his initial verdict having spent time behind the wheel of Fiat's electric family car We liked the no-nonsense effervescence and effortless fun of the all-electric 600e. While the entry 600e Red is pretty well stocked too, we think the £4,000 premium to trade up to La Prima is worth it for the useful extras it offers. Driving it from Broadway in the Cotswolds and traversing the highways, byways and towns and villages of rural Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire was a delight – not quite the Tuscany beloved of middle-class British tourists and second homeowners, but arguably the closest we have to Italy's 'Ciantishire'. Fiat - like the Godfather - is an Italian that wants to make you an offer you can't refuse. Even with the £3,000 off, it's hard to look beyond the price premium over the 600 Hybrid.  Until Britain's roads are better equipped with chargers, it's hard to argue against playing it safe and choosing the 'electrified' hybrid rather than the all-singing, all-dancing 600e EV. ",2024-03-12,,

The 600e doesn’t replace an existing model – the slightly larger but visually similar 500X will remain on sale for the time being – but it does revive a model name last used in 2010 on an Italy-only model (formerly the Seicento). Just like Jeep announced with its Avenger earlier this year, Fiat will also bring a petrol version of the 600 to the UK due to current sluggish sales of EVs amongst private buyers. The 128bhp 1.2-litre mild-hybrid petrol will be paired with a six-speed manual gearbox, and is expected to land in Britain next year. This soft suspension tune does translate into body roll during fast cornering, and coupled with light steering the 600e isn’t what you’d call a sporting electric hatchback to drive. It isn’t quick, either, with 0-60mph taking nine seconds and even with the throttle is pinned to the floor the 600e is sprightly rather than fast. But there’s more than enough performance for pottering around town and normal everyday driving. Fiat has long struggled with enlarging the 500’s cheeky look into a larger package, with the 500X and 500L being proof of this. The 600e is arguably the best attempt yet at a larger 500, but we’d stop short of saying it’s pretty in perhaps the way you might expect it to be. Like with the 500e and Mini with its new Cooper hatchback, chrome is out and in are cleaner surfaces, with just a sprinkling of bright work added to around the 600’s windows and along the bottom of the doors. It’s an attractive shape, particularly at the rear, but the heavy-lidded headlamps, the slitty upper vent beneath the ‘600’ badge and fussy grilles at the bottom of the bumper are just a bit too ungainly, we feel. You might be surprised to hear the interior is very Jeep too, as the 600e poaches a lot of the Avenger’s dashboard. The centre console with its quirky i-Pad-like cover, 10.25-inch touchscreen, and upper and lower elements are all carried over. The La Prima models add a ivory-painted panel across the centre of the dashboard and ‘Fiat’ embossed seats to add some retro flair, but the interior is more pleasant rather than feeling special. One reason for this is the interior quality – the dashboard and doors are covered in hard plastics. It all feels well put together but it lacks a plush feeling you might be expecting. Along with the bold colour palette, La Prima cars get 18-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels, synthetic leather seats, a reversing camera and a six-way electric driver’s seat with a massaging function. The MG4 is cheaper than the 600e, but frankly it undercuts pretty much all of its rivals. The Fiat is cheaper than its sisters Avenger and E-2008 and is reasonable value for money and is well-equipped for this segment The Hen harrier in flight IN PICTURES: Big night in Clara at Summer Soiree to launch of the Clara Town First Team Bernadette Kinsella who got her 5 Year Service Award during the week Pat and Fidelma celebrate special wedding anniversary with family and friends in Tullamore Some of the waste dumped in a River Barrow tributory

AXGNb76QgH0,foreign 500e and you should it's brilliant but for you it was just on the small side then this might be just the thing you need because this is the new Fiat 600e which is basically the 500e but it's bigger chunkier and yeah looks like an SUV that's the simple way of looking at the Fiat 600e and it'll be enough to get most people interested SUVs are super trendy these days of course but there's a lot more going on Under the Skin firstly it's not actually a chunky 500e  technically it's basically a Jeep Avenger and built in the same Factory in Poland and it uses Parts also found in the Vauxhall Market e and the Peugeot e 2008 among a few more so it's a bit French a bit American a bit polish and with some Italians sprinkled on top but what does that matter when it looks like this all the things that make the 500e look cool and cute are here but it does look a bit meaner than the 500e large model name in the center true Fiat style rather than the manufacturer badge but I don't know I'm still not sure about these eyelids Jerry's out for me on those now feet have done a very good job of basically making it look like a chubby 500e nice big wheels up to 18 inch to keep it all in proportion what's interesting are the color options Sophia have apparently banned Gray even though it's the UK's most popular car color bulb move Fiat instead you get uniquely Italian takes on four particular themes C sun sky and Earth but the Earth color is called sand and I don't know what you think but to me doesn't it look quite gray maybe not so bold after all fit and then around the back a very familiar slope very 500-esque and what's interesting is the boot size 360 liters that's double the size of the Fiat 500 and apparently the biggest in class so says Fiat and it does have some useful features but the suspension covers at the side are quite intrusive and you'll actually find a lot more space in a Kia Nero EV or a Peugeot e 2008 fiance this has 15 liters of front storage which apparently is best in class but maybe someone forgot to tell them that the Jeep Avenger which is basically made on the same production line by basically the same company has 34. anyway a cool Central Storage cubby which has this nice looking iPad cover but I might get a little irritating three cup holders um decent sized door bins and a rather large glove box it also has wireless charging and one two three USB ports which is all well and good apart from the kids in the back might have to fight over who uses that one USB at least they won't fight about who uses the rear door Pockets though because there aren't any but a baffling oversight there are buckets on the back of the chairs for phones or books but it'd be nice to have a central armrest with cup holders in for me leg room is sufficient but if they're at all a driver then perhaps that would start to feel a little squished Headroom definitely sufficient isofix on both sides considering it's the same height as the 500e feels good pretty spacious beyond all that it's just really stylish in here the dashboard is lifted from the 500 quite literally and it looks lovely including the integrated LED lighting the touchscreen is fairly straightforward to use and there are shortcut buttons for the main functions so you're not fiddling around in menus too much which is a good job because the software design is quite busy the main question though does it drive as well as Fiat says it does right where's the exit we can't keep going around here all night we're told it has a beautiful joyful pampered Driving Experience Big Talk pampered I'd say overall yes the first thing he notices how quiet it is I mean obviously electric cars tend to be a lot quieter because you don't have the internal combustion sounds but then usually you end up hearing an awful lot of tire and wind noise but actually fiat's done a really good job of shutting that sound out suspension is on the softer side too soaks up the bumps well and body control feels pretty good when you turn sharply in a corner it doesn't feel like the Leaning Tower of Pisa so you might worry that it doesn't have the same frisky character as the Fiat 500 the sense that it's small Nimble and fun especially given that it's an SUV and it uses so many bits of other cars but you shouldn't worry you can feel the 500 in here the steering is really light but it turns the car quite sharply and that means at higher speeds it feels kind of alert and alive but around town also dead easy to maneuver kind of effortless unlike the Fiat 500 which can feel a bit cramped this feels a lot less claustrophobic visibility is good too it's a nice driving position and you've got really good view of the road ahead plus you can pretty much see all four corners of the car the 600e has a single electric motor driving the front wheels but the power you get depends on which of the three driving modes the car's in in normal mode it has 109 horsepower but an Eco that drops to just 82 to make the battery last longer and in sport it leaps up to 154 driving modes in cars like this often don't make much difference but in here they really do whichever mode you're in this is not the fastest of cars not 62 in nine seconds but if you're a speed demon or you like to regularly overtake then pop it in sport mode because it does make a massive difference certainly feels an awful lot snappier the 600e comes with a 54 kilowatt hour battery which is good for about 249 miles or 372 if you're just pootling around town some of its Rivals like the Kia Nero or the Volvo ex30 do have bigger batteries but it does charge pretty quickly at up to 100 kilowatts so that's good for not 80 in about half an hour the 33 000 pounds base model called red doesn't have navigation it also comes with steel wheels under plastic covers ugh you'll need a top level Prima model for your big Alloys and your Sat Nav which is 37 000 pounds it also comes with keyless entry a massaging driver's seat fully adaptive cruise control including automatic stop and go in traffic and even a hands-free tailgate loads of stuff basically but still no rear door pockets or gray paint never gray paint unless you go for sand which is definitely not gray anyway at least they're trying to encourage people to make bold color choices and that sums up the 600e pretty nicely there's just something about it that's more fun more joyful if you like than the average small crossover and if that doesn't convince you the price just might remember at 33 000 pounds is nearly four grand cheaper than a Kia e Nero and Peugeot e 2008 and almost 6 000 pounds less than a Vauxhall Moka e and that combination of price personality and practicality is what makes the 600e here so appealing it's an affordable electric crossover that you'll buy because you want to not just because you need the space I like it it's a shame it's not a bit quicker although sport mode is quite fun the space in the back is not huge and boot space while it's okay it could be a problem if you had a large family but that's just the thing isn't it with these crossover types but all in all yeah if you're looking for a grown-up car but you're not quite ready to be a grown-up then this could be just the car for you [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you [Music],2023-11-27,NEW Fiat 600E Review: Fantastic or Flawed? | 4K,AutoTrader
MvgfB8kcS1s,"fats have always had this fabulous way of winning you over I never thought I was going to be a fat 500 girl but then I spent time with a f 500 electric and I also owned an arbar 595 for around a year and quickly they're fun and quirky and quite often compromised personalities just made me fall in love but have they been able to inject that fat passion into their latest larger electric product this is the Fiat 600e and in today's video we're going to be finding out if it's Love at First fat or if I'm going to be dumping it at the end of this video plus I'll be giving you all the facts and figures that you need to know if you're considering this as your next car so if that sounds good then please keep watching and if you like new car reviews and car content well you're in the right place please go ahead and hit the Subscribe button so before we talk about that quirky fat styling let me tell you all the important facts and figures around the electric bits it's fitted with a 54 KW battery capable of covering a claimed 250 Mi on a single charge the 154 PS electric motor has proven credentials and provides the power to allow the Fiat to accelerate from not to 62 mph in 9 seconds before reaching top speeds of 93 mph prices start from a reasonable 32995 however fat are offering the egant to give you £3,000 pound towards the purchase price then making it one of the cheapest electric SUVs on the market if you're not bothered about the electric stuff there is also a 1.2 L petrol mild hybrid version with 100 brake horsepower that cuts the price to just 23, 975 yes a whopping £99,000 less the fat 600e has a maximum charging speed of 100 KW so that's slightly behind some Rivals but still if you find a charger quick enough then you can go from not to 80% in around half an hour if you've got an at home wbox like I have now this will charge at 7 KW and it will take you around 8 hours for a full charge at first glance you might think the new car is just a fancy replacement for the firm's 500x crossover but it's not so the 500 x has still got a couple more years in it yet this 600 is a bit smaller and lower sliding right under the 500 x in the fiat's lineup it's like the bigger four-door sibling to the 500 just like the good old 600 from the 1950s fat have done a good job of beefing up the appearance of The Lovable 500e even if the design below and above the number plate make it look a bit like they've added a mustache and a goatee to its baby brother the classic theat styling of the rounder motive headlamps and the Funky flower designed alloy wheels help to play homage to the brand and the floating 600 beside the lights is a nice touch electric cars come in two trim levels Lea and red red models have the choice of three colors and it will come as no surprise that one of those is red the interior also features black seats with red embroidered stitching and a red dashboard insert the lur Prima models are for those who are looking to go a bit more daring with their colors all four of the colors are inspired by elements of the Italian landscape the one I have named orange Sun of Italy Blue Sky of Italy Green Sea of Italy and sand Earth of Italy all a prima models get a light interior lastly opting for the hybrid only trim means that you get all of these colors paired together with black and ivory fabric seats around the back they're once again leaning into their Italian Heritage and you'll find the Italian flag just down here in the embossed 600 it's a pretty nice rear design not as nice as the front you do get some 3D tail lights but I don't quite like them as much as the emotive front lights you also get a nice gloss black spoiler which I do think is a nice addition now inside this boot you'll get 360 L of space you also get an electric boot which I found really handy now 360 isn't the biggest of its Rivals but actually I find it more than practical I've been moving house this week and it's been taking all of my stuff for the house move so it's been easily a very practical car you've got a nice load area as you can see it's nice and kind of waist length to load things in and it will easily fit quite a few suitcases and you even have some underfloor storage where you're able to pop your charging cables moving on to the interior of the 600e and I think that Fiat have done a pretty good job at bringing the personality of the 500 into this larger electric product it feels very quintessentially fat however there's still no denying the fact that this does just feel a little bit like a rebranded product from either perso or voxel around the cabin you will find things like this the start stop button which are familiar throughout every one of those products although fear have done a good job at bringing their own personality especially to these wonderful seats I really like these I know that may be contrasting and some people may find the light Fabric or light leather a little bit impractical but I think they look great and they match the personality although I would definitely want to go for one of the greens or Blues to match with this lovely light blue greeny stitching here and you also have fat all the way down the center I just think these are really nice I also love the armrest this can also be extended which is quite nice and then you have this slightly strange storage area now this can be customized using these little bits of plastic so you can have extra cup holders or you can take them out so that you have just an open storage area but I don't know I've always found these little bits of plastic a little bit cheap personally I'd rather just have some standard cup holders as you always need cup holders now here you have some additional storage and you'll see that it's behind this slightly strange how I would describe iPad cover so this is actually magnetic and it kind of folds up so that you can customize that storage there and you can also take it completely out as well although I don't think that looks particularly nice I'm not really sure how I feel about this I feel like it feels a little bit cheap they've done this in the Jeep advenger as well and I would have rather they'd gone for a more high quality coverage rather than this little bit of lever although I'm sure some people are going to love it now inside of here you will find your USB and USBC charger as well as a 12vt charging point so lots of charging options and if those still aren't enough you also have some wireless charging in the center as well which is really handy Above This storage section you also have a little snack drawer where they pop very nicely or of course when you're not wirelessly charging your phone that will fit in there as well it's just a nice storage option to have the layout is very good as well it's all very easy to see you've got a nice clear screen although I would say that this screen feels a little bit small compared to some other rival products however despite the touchscreen being slightly on the smaller side compared to some Rivals I find the functionality very simple and one of the main reasons why the functionality is so good is because of physical buttons in this center console you've got three and four if you can the hazard light physical buttons hazards you've got your door locks you've got a car here which gives you a shortcut to all of your different safety systems and then you have the home button which takes you straight back to the home screen for instance if you're using your Apple carplay which is Wireless you can then just press home and that takes you back to the main home screen which is really simple as you can see on the left hand side your climate control dials stay here on your home screen how ever you don't really need them because you've got everything you need right here you've got dials which you can click up and down to change the temperature as well as automatic AC Max AC and off as well as your fan speed as well here on the right now the only disappointing thing is there's no Dual Zone climate control so you can't change it between you and your passenger but I really like that you have all of these physical buttons now if you wanted to access your heated seats for for instance you have a menu button in the middle here and then that will give you a quick function to be able to angle your fan speed and to also go on to seat options and change your heated seats but if that's a few too many shortcuts then what you can do is on your home screen you can just pull down and your heated seats stay there at all times and you've also got your Apple carplay as well and you can change some other shortcuts to be here at the swipe down menu so it's really easy to find your favorite different functions when you swipe across the screen you'll see your map and then swipe again and then you've got loads of different functions including things like your energy consumption as well as lots of other features there's plenty of things to play around with and you have all of your modern-day technology with electric meaning that you can set your climate control before you start your journey when it's connected overnight which I think is really handy jumping into the back of the 600e you are reminded of the fact that though it is larger than the 500e it's definitely not the biggest family car as you can see this is in my driving position and I don't have the most leg room so six foot people would struggle although there's quite a lot of head space I'm impressed with that you do get some USBC charging which is in this armrest which unfortunately does come quite far back and you don't get any cup holders in the center or an armrest which is a shame you also don't get any storage in the doors either so it's not exactly the most practical in the back here that's a little bit disappointing but things that I do like you still get this really high quality lever you've got the same stitching which feels really nice it's also nice and light because you've got a light headlining so despite being a little bit smaller it still doesn't feel claustrophobic I also like the fact that both of your is fixed fitments in the back here are behind Zips so that's going to keep things nice and tidy and it also just feels a little bit more premium you do also have door pockets on both the backs of the seats but you really do have a compromised middle seating position because this sits on the same platform to accommodate non-el electric vehicles that means that you still have a transmission tunnel so if I slide across to the middle one you have to get your leg behind that Center armrest and then you have to sit either side of the transmission tunnel and as you can see there that doesn't leave you much space either side for people sitting to the size of you so really if you are going to use this car it's only really a four- seater five if you absolutely have to so the last piece of the puzzle is to take the 600e out for a spin and tell you about the Driving Experience I'm not particularly a fan of these little buttons for selecting the gears but let's face it those really are minor things so we'll just quickly put it in drive and I'm actually going to put it straight into my braking mode as well because unfortunately that does stop every single time and even if you go to park or if you go to reverse if you go back into drive it turns it off which I find a little bit annoying but we'll put it back into braking mode and I'm just going to make sure that I'm in the normal driving mode for now there's three different modes you've got economy normal and Sport as well but going to sit it in normal because I think really that's where fat 600e drivers are going to have it most of the time and overall I found it a really Pleasant Driving Experience they seem to have got the balance for this car very very good you see it's quite engaging you've got not the lightest steering but it is actually quite nice to drive there's not too much roll in the corners the throttle response is good but it's not too sharp so that means that when you're pulling away the wheels don't Spin and it doesn't throw you back in your seat it's actually quite a smooth power delivery of course if you want a sharper power delivery you can pop it in sport and then it will become a bit more responsive and of course the opposite to that when it's in Eco that then dulls down your throttle response and really it does become very dull at that point so I think you're going to want to have it in normal most of the time and it does have that theat personality about it with the steering you see the steering is quite light and that means it's really easy to maneuver around town and you do lose a little bit of kind of the engagement when you're on the back roads because it's not exactly thrilling to drive because you do feel the steering is just a bit too light so if you throw it around you don't always have the best control over the vehicle but then that wasn't designed to be like that it was designed to be a fat 500 or a fat 600 and have that theat personality and the personality of the fear has always been that it's a fantastic City car and for that I think they've got it nailed and despite of course being a much larger vehicle than the 500 it still feels really easy to maneuver it doesn't feel like a large car and of course on this model I have got the rear view camera so it's easy to park as well and you've got pretty good visibility it's quite a small rear window but actually elsewhere around the car it's a decent amount of visibility nice visibility over the Bonnet and I'm actually sitting down quite low so if I was to go up a bit higher I can then see over the full Bonnet which I know for a lot of people is a plus point so that means you can always see exactly how close you are to things in front of you overall I don't really have any complaints about the drive of this car other than the regenerative braking so there's only one level of regenerative braking and that can be found via the button next to the drive button and it's not exactly a one pedal drive if that's what you like so we'll accelerate and then just come off of the accelerator and as you can see this is with the regenerative breaking and it's not even going to break me in time for my corner so we're going to go around the corner still off of the throttle and now we're coming to a crawl so it does take a while to slow down I really like regenerative breaking and I like it to be as strong as possible because I like a one pedal drive so if that's what you're after then maybe the 600e isn't going to be the vehicle for you but if you're not too fussed about that regenerative braking then elsewhere everything is really nice about the car and I also love the fact that you have a shortcut underneath the screen which has a little car on it press that and it instantly takes you to your lane keeping assist and you can also kind of favorite some things on here so if there's other things you want to turn off on the Safety Systems then you can get there really really quickly but I actually haven't found the lane assist to be that intrusive I've actually found it to be quite well balanced so I really don't think you'd need to turn it off but if it's something you really dislike then you have that really quick shortcut it's all just really easy to use and it's not particularly exciting to drive but then it didn't need to be thing which I've always found it a little bit difficult to trust stellantis regarding is efficiency and what do I I mean by that well you see their early electric cars like the Corsa e or the Perse e208 they were not particularly efficient they were supposed to do around 200 miles on a full charge and in reality and especially in Winter they were only getting around 100 miles and this was due to poor thermal efficiency and also they were running on some poor efficiency tires as well but over time stanus have made changes to these cars and those original cars then got 220 Mi of claimed range and they were achieving much closer to 180 they were far better after they made those changes and now you have these new generation of cars the slightly larger ones you've got this the 600e the Jeep Avenger electric you've also got the new perso e208 and they claim closer to 250 mil but can they achieve that well I'm really pleased to say that with dramatic Paws I really think they have now made the right changes to be able to achieve these figures you see when I've been spending time with this the 600e I've seen in upwards of 5 m per kilowatt hour that's really impressive if you know your electric cars you'll know that that's pretty much as good as it gets that is the ultimate EV Driving Experience though because I've been doing drives a little bit in warmer climat so it's been around 15° and also I've been doing shorter Journeys and at lower speed so around 30 mph and that's the ultimate EV Driving Experience but still I'm really impressed with that efficiency and on that claimed efficiency it should be able to do the claimed 250 miles but what about when you get out on the motorway or when it's a little bit colder well I've done that as well and I've seen around 4.1 miles per kilowatt hour which is really quite good of course that is going to be a slight drop but you do expect that when you're doing those Motorway miles and that's probably going to see around 200 to 220 mil but this is still really impressive and I think that's right on the money for the target audience of this car I think that most people should be easily able to run a car on 220 M I appreciate that other than the complaint about the slight lack of strength to the regenerative braking and the weird quality of that interior iPad cover in the center console this has been a very positive review and I do really like the Fiat 600e but would I put my money where my mouth is and actually buy one well there's some serious competition out there and there's some serious competition for more affordable Rivals I think if you can get a good enough deal on a 600e then it's a very strong option for a fun family electric car but let me know what do you think of the 600e or would you go for one of the rivals let me know which in the comments down below I really hope you have enjoyed this video today guys if you have go ahead and give it a

much?! Fiat 600e review UK 4K,Auto Social UK
eZMrw98nHgU,"I know what you're thinking Nikki's lost her mind Nicola already did a review of the fat 600e one possibly both of those statements are in fact correct however you might notice something different we're not in Italy no it's gray which means we are of course in Great Britain so this is the first time we're testing the car on the Great British road so I am here to find out if this lovely little motor has the essence of lul Vita because I think we all need a bit of sweetness in our lives without the calories but before we find out if the fat 600D does have all the ingredients but are sweet life remember subscribe to the channel thanks very much now here at electrifying we've always been huge fans of the fat 500 E its cute personality isn't just Skin Deep it's a very competent little electric car and little is the right word because while supposedly you can squeeze four people in it it's not a particularly elegant way to transport your friends and um well I mean in terms of getting car seats kids all of their stuff it ain't happening so the 600 E with its Five Doors and a more spacious interior could be the perfect answer for those who want the charm of a 500y but the space that comes with a small crossover now Fiat simply hasn't just taken the 500 and stretched it a bit they've actually gone down the far easier route of actually pinching the big bits that you can't see including the battery and the electric motor from the Jeep Avenger now that kind of sounds like cheating doesn't it but the Avenger is actually a great little electric car so the 600e has actually all the right ingredients to be a really good car now it's got all the good bits of the fat 500 uh but obviously it's a little bit bigger um it still has that kind of cutesy charm but we got to talk about the eyes what's going on and the expression actually generally is it a slightly kind of seductive smirk or is it resting face depends on your mood I think the way you look at it uh I'm going to go resting  face in this case says a lot about me doesn't it um the other thing the eyelids eyelashes eyelids slightly closed I think again it's supposed to be that kind of you know Zoolander what is that pose called the Zoolander blue steel look but I feel like they actually just look a bit Dopey like the eyes are kind of half asleep like a kind of half asleep Angry Bird 10 out of 10 for this the mascara flick that I can never get the right angle on so whoever did that if you come do my makeup that would be Fab um 50 cm longer than the 500 50 cm well used I would say it's got presents doesn't it this car um it's still compact got presents but it's not too much of a handful unlike some people I know no now f is making a big song and dance about the color with the 600 apparently it's embracing its dolita Spirit by ditching gray H too many car makers paint their cars in boring Shades believes Fiat and that's why you can now choose from some very bright colors come with rather fancy names too so orange is called the son of Italy but I thought the sun was yellow anyway the sort of greeny blue color is the sky of Italy again I thought the sky was like a pale blue anyway the Sea of Italy is a Bluey greeny color too and then there's the Earth of Italy which is well actually it's kind of gray I'm so confused here is a little known fact for you now the CM 500 that we all know and absolutely adore was of course that original car that put families on the road it put Italy on the map when it came to cars and it spread like wildfire around the world we absolutely loved it and we fell in love with the model however 2 years previously the 600 was born so actually the 600 was the Forerunner to the 500 and I think most people think it's the other way around this is what US Brits like to call the boot and there is 360 L of the stuff which means it's kind of small um it's actually smaller than the VW ID3 it's smaller than the mg4 however it has a variable floor if you get La Prima version daada I like to call it the hidden floor because you can hide things in there like treats or charging cables what else can I show you oh I know the seats they fold in a 46 60 fashion which is always handy when you need to put loads of cargo in the car uh oh this is just a reminder 600 the model you're driving and of course at the touch of a button your boot closes I do like that and just in case you have forgotten again there's the 600 with the Italian flag to remind you that this is the fat 600e okay well back here I was hoping I'd have a bit more space but it's still a bit claustrophobic definitely bigger than the 500 that's for sure um but well you can see where the seat position is and how much space there is between my knees and the front seat I'm actually running a Vox or mocka e at the moment and I would say that's slightly bigger in the back I mean as you can see this opening is quite narrow um and if you're trying to get car seats in kids it's going to be a battle I mean I mean it's always a battle putting kids in a car seat but uh putting their mood and Tantrums to one side it's still going to be a bit tough but once they're in they're not going anywhere um other thing to note back here is you've got a lovely little USB C Port which is very useful however it only comes in the top spec um but other than that it's a nice place to be it feels expensive for quite a affordable car um and I do quite like if you see the stitching on the seats back here it does say f it which you might think is a bit too much brand in your face but the way they've done the stitching it's kind of subtle and it it looks it looks kind of cool I like it it's more like a pattern but if you look closely it says theet well that is the rear space probably the last time I'm going to sit in this position to be honest time for the front that was clever wasn't it now if you look quite hard um the bottom part of this Dash you will notice it looks a bit like the Jeep Avenger um and that is because bits have just been pinched from the Jeep Avenger um whether that was a good idea or not I'm not 100% sure I mean down here is where your drive selector is it's an all right place for I suppose this funny little cubby iPad cover I I just don't understand um has also been stolen from the Avenger which definitely should have stayed the rest of it though you can tell it's been inspired by the fat 500 because it does have that retro feeling about it I love this Ivory finish up here now this is La Prima version topspec version therefore you get it in Ivory if you go for the entry level red this part will actually be the same color as the body paint um which is quite nice but I prefer it in Ivory um up front here we've got your lovely digital display right in front of the driver position got all the information you should hope for infotainment system nice and easy to use now you only get SAA on the top spec car but let's be honest who uses that luckily Wireless Apple carplay and Android auto are standard on all the models so just stick with that physical buttons which I used to really like but my view is now changing very useful I think to have all of the the stuff that you need straight away with no distractions of having to go into various menus at your fingertips however what I do quite like is if it's just at the bottom of the screen at all times that would be my preference but um anyway this is what you've got physical buttons um and yeah all in all I think it does feel quite elegant a bit retro a little bit PL iy at times but for the price point it's kind of what you would expect there's just one motor battery option the 600e and no surprises here it's the same as you'll find on a whole host of stellantis electric cars so that means a 54 kilowatt hour battery or 51 KW usable and a 154 brake horsepower motor which drives the front wheel this is good for a range of up to 254 m in the cheaper red model or 252 mi in La Prima we first tested the 600e last summer in a sizzling Italy on a mixture of roads and we actually averaged around 220 mil now in a colder UK in the winter we've actually been getting closer to 200 miles fat does throw in a heat pump of sandard though which should help in those cooler temperatures right this is the important bit how does it drive and well I can tell you straight away it's quite different from the 500 I think this is where we really see the differences um because the 500 is kind of like nippy and agile bit like a little Terrier darting around all the time whereas this it feels it's a bit more refined it's a bit more grownup which I suppose is what you would expect from more of a family car it's a bit more black laab like um I don't know why I'm using dog analogies cuz they've really got nothing to do with dog but there you go now in terms of handling steering is quite light I feel a bit disconnected to the road it's okay but just a little lighter than I would like um that kind of goes for the braking as well you really have to kind of thump on the brake pedal to stop what I do like is you've got the B button for the regen now that is the mode that I just have it on permanently because it means I don't have to use the brake pedal as much however we will test this I'll use it a little bit but it doesn't actually come to a complete standstill no um so it's just sort of slows you down now this has 154 brake horsepower woohoo um and it has enough not loads and you do feel like it struggles a little bit if you're trying to overtake on the motorway but um yeah it's going to be absolutely fine for kind of driving around town and going at a very moderate speed on the motorway I've got to say though the ride is pretty good you can hear the suspension thump into the potholes luckily not so many around here compared to in Italy but it doesn't actually translate into an uncomfortable ride it is relatively smooth now in the press conference before they gave me the keys to this Fiat said that apparently according to them 66% British people thought that living an Italian lifestyle would make them happier does it make make me happier o what have we got here an Italian Suite oh it's chocolate nuts in now I'm happier I can confirm living the Italian lifestyle does make me [Music] happier now the doich lifestyle is all very well but ultimately how much is it going to cost us and there is no nothing sweeter in life than a bargain now when we first drove this in Italy we were hoping for a price point around the 30,000 Mark and now we know the figures are in bear with me it's a little bit disappointing to start with but wait for it so the entry level the red model is coming in at 32,9 195 La Prima is four grand more 36 995 but fat have said that for at least the rest of 20124 they are committed to this that anyone that buys a fat 600e will get £3,000 off the list price they basically said they're pretty angry at the government for originally offering all of us incentives to buy electric cars and then the government slly took it away so feia have said don't worry guys if the government can't do it we know they're going to let us down at some point as they always do we will do it for you so they are offering £3,000 off the list price which means the entry level is under 30 grand just by5 but still it's under 30k right okay let's conclude this drive of the Fiat 600e now if you did fall in love with the Fiat 500 and love that cutesy character but it was just limiting you on the size and the practicality well then this could be for you because it is a bit bigger it is a bit more practical and it drives a little bit better is this lulita wrapped up in a car well honestly I think you're going to have to have quite a good imagination and some good Italian food on hand [Music] and well hopefully we've sprinkled a bit of DOL Vite over you and your happiness level has skyrocketed to 10

Does the 500e’s big sister have la dolce vita? | Electrifying.com,Electrifying
HAZC8wrWQGM,the Fiat 600e is the latest electric car from the Italian brand it shares a platform on a Powertrain with the Jeep Avenger a sister brand from the stalantis group meaning a range of up to 254 miles for this pure electric High riding family hatchback with prices starting at just under 33 000 pounds now we really like the Jeep Avenger not least because it is actually a properly compact car that's one of the things that I think you know it's a quite a small car yet it's got a decent range and the Fiat 600e is much the same so for the Fiat you're looking at 4.17 meters long which for some context is sort of between a Volkswagen Polo and golf in length so it really is kind of a usefully compact City car yet it is also more than kind of big enough and mature enough if you want to do high mileage with it if you're going on the motorway routinely it is what I think Fiat would probably call a B plus so it's good in that respect because it's not huge so many modern cars are getting a bit big aren't they and I think the fact that the Fiat and the Jeep sort of buck that trend is good now you'll have to forgive me we're out on the international launch but we don't have a huge amount of time with the car so this may not be quite up to scratch with our normal CarGurus reviews but hopefully it'll give you a good idea of what to expect with a Fiat 600D which after all is quite a big model lots of people out there are looking for a car that's not too big reasonably priced a decent range take the boxes for a lot of people because it looks cool and it's really nice to drive we're out in Sharon around the company it's very historic Mira Fury Factory this car is actually made in Poland but nonetheless Fiat have very very deep roots here in Turin so they wanted to show us their lovely Factory and this is where we're driving the car and I can't blame for it for really pushing home the Italian point I mean you know you've got the Italian badge on the bumper you the colors are called things like Sun by Italy and uh you know Sand by Italy which absolutely isn't gray by the way you know Fiat said they're not doing great cars anymore I would say that sand by it and he looks quite gray but gloss over that the dash is also rather striking with a painted finish to match the car even in the 600e red which is the cheaper of the two Trims on offer a 10 inch color touchscreen with Wireless Apple carplay and Android auto is standard too and there's plenty of room in the back seats for two average size adults or for a couple of kids but three will be a bit of a push a 360 liter boot will be fine for most everyday family duties although it is annoying that you have to go for top spec La Prima to get a variable boot floor but it is a big price jump up it's something that over four thousand pounds more than the uh cheaper red Fiat 600a anyway even that's reasonably well equipped you get your reversing sensors um you get the 10 inch touchscreen here the Uconnect system which we've seen on quite a few other stellantis cars now as well it's pretty good the graphics are good it's reasonably easy to use a wireless Apple carplay and Android auto I actually think it does a pretty good job driving wise definitely Comfort oriented the steering's really light but it does the job I do think you could do with more feedback I think if you're comparing this to say the 2008 and the Jeep Avenger which a lot of people will be it feels agile enough actually on some of the faster roads around here in Italy it's been really quite good fun but you don't get a huge amount of feedback through the steering wheel it's absolutely fine for what you want it to do 10 and a half meter turning Circle so it's reasonably nippy and wieldy around town I think it just does exactly what you want it to do it's not massively fast 9 seconds to 62. uh front wheel drive of course you've got that single electric motor up front and you have a 51 kilowatt hour usable battery for an official wltp of 254 miles all in I think the Fiat 600e has got a lot going for it I think that basic sort of sub 33 000 pound price would be quite tempting to a lot of people the monthly prices in the UK are going to be really critical if they can get those down and keep deposits and APR down and that kind of thing then I think a lot of people will go for it because it really is a nice blend I think of being both really convenient for things like the school run and nipping to the shops because it's quite Compact and yeah it feels comfy and sort of substantial enough to also do the family trips at the weekend further up the motorway to see family and that kind of thing as for Real World Range we saw 4.3 miles per kilowatt hour on our varied summer route on the roads around Turin for the 600e international launch that's good for a range of 220 miles while we would expect to see that drop to around 180 miles in winter with the standard heat pump helping with winter efficiency I like it I really do like it I think perhaps the Jeep's got a bit more gumption to it style wise I don't know maybe the sort of cheerfulness and the slickness and the italian-ness of the 600D will win people over I do think that longer range cars like the mg4 even arguably when you look at things like the ID3 which is quite a bit bigger it has got a lot of competition this car so you've got to specifically have to want a car that's not too big and that has that sort of style Focus I think to choose this over some of those Rivals even so it's a well-rounded product it's got a lot going for it and I do genuinely really like it and that is the new Fiat 600e don't forget to head to cargurus.co.uk for a whole host of fantastic used cars and while we've got you please do like the video

UK
Z6vFfBmTXuA,hello Electro heads Tish here and welcome back to the channel now if you're after a small electric crossover from the stalantis group well you're spoiled for Choice pretty much every single manufacturer now has one in their lineup and Fiat wasn't about to miss out introducing the all-new Fiat 600e but what makes this car different from the rest of the cars that are currently out there after all they all share the same battery and running gear there isn't much difference between them so why choose the Fiat or hopefully that's what I'm going to get to the bottom of in today's video so if that sounds good then please keep watching and if you like electric car content and Electric Mobility then this is the place to be if you're looking for a car that's going to blend in amongst the Sea of monochrome Motors then you're out of luck here but for those of us who like to look on the brighter side of life the 600e will only be available in a cheery color palette inspired by the beauty of Italy that includes Hues of suns of Italy Seas of Italy Earth of Italy and skies of Italy Fiat had the vision of transforming the design and personality of the Fiat 500 electric city car into a larger more practical package that would better cater for family needs with the 600e to simplify the task the company utilized the platform motor battery pack and interior technology of the 600e from the stalantis parts bin consequently it shares many features with the newly launched Jeep Avenger in fact they're now built alongside one another in the factory in tinchi Poland design while this is possibly something which is more important to Fiat than well anything really you buy a Fiat because of the design you don't buy them because of the power you don't buy them because of the ride comfort you buy them because they're quirky and cool and you can absolutely tell that that's what they've gone with with the new 600e do I like it no I don't think I do it does borderline just on a bit too quirky for me they've given it this big grin at the bottom and they've given it these emotive headlights with the eyebrows at the top but for me personally I don't think it's a particularly stylish looking car but that's all down to personal perception because if you want something which is gonna stand out it's gonna be quirky it's gonna have that kind of personality then this is going to be an excellent choice as I mentioned you've got the grill at the bottom which almost creates this smile with the Fiat 600 and then you've got this kind of strange Grill in the middle I'm not really sure what the purpose of this is and I think maybe that's what's throwing off the exterior design for me personally I really like the badging and I like the badging around the car as well you've got this 600e at the front here in Chrome and you can also find it in some of the lights around the back and you've also got it in the side of the light there the wheels are very quirky as well I like that they've gone for that retro style it almost looks a little bit like a flower what worries me nowadays with electric Wheels is how are these going to last manufacturers nowadays are going for these really busy two-tone designs and it does concern me that if you look at Citron wheels from around five years ago you'll struggle to find one that's not corroded so is that a trend that we're going to start to see on cars in five ten years time we'll have to wait and see the headline stats for the 600e are as follows a 54 kilowatt hour battery and a standard heat pump help to achieve 250 miles of electric range a 156 brake horsepower electric motor propels the fear to 60 miles per hour in 9 seconds it could also charge at maximum speeds of 100 kilowatts whilst isn't the most impressive amongst its Rivals will still top up the battery from 20 to 80 percent in less than half an hour the interior of the 600e is a delightful throwback to fiat's Rich Heritage with numerous nods to its iconic predecessor the dashboard design and petite instrument panel pay homage the original 600 while the seats feature a tasteful stitched company logo even the steering wheel serves as a tribute to the classic 600. quality might be lacking but it's all quite pleasingly cheery fear offers two trim levels for the 600e the entry-level red option starts at 32.995 and includes 16-inch steel wheels gloss Black Wing mirror caps matte side skirts automatic climb control rear parking sensors keyless go and LED lights it also features unique red logos a red Dash and red accents on the upholstery the higher end La Prima option starts at 36.995 that adds 18 inch diamond cut alloy wheels Chrome assets and an ivory Dash a rear camera heated leather seats with a massage function for the driver a hands-free tailgate and Wireless smartphone charging both trims come with a seven inch driver's display with a 10.25 inch infotainment screen with Wireless Apple carplay and Android auto but lipoma also includes integrated navigation and an upgraded sound system around the back I feel like the design is slightly more palatable than the front it's not quite as daring and I quite like a few of the design cues around here you've got a nice contrasting black spoiler I really like the lights as well very similar to what we're seeing on other brands products they're in this Crystal Clear design so you can see the inner workings you've got the 600 on the side and I like the way you've got this dappled Chrome effect which blends with the front of the car I also quite like the contrasting black bumper at the bottom you've got the 600 embossed in it and you've also got the Italian flag it's just a nice little touch which gives it that Italian Flair which fear is of course so well known for now whilst working on design fear have also concentrated quite hard on making this car not too large from the exterior so it's easy to drive around town but they've also worked quite hard on maximizing the interior space that you get as well so inside the boot you'll find quite a decent level of storage when it comes to boot space it falls within the average range for its class with a capacity of 360 liters it suppresses the smart hashtag one by 37 liters however it falls significantly short compared to the Kia Nero EV which offers a whopping 115 more liters of space and it's also 110 liters smaller than the mgzse EV fear not storage elsewhere is practical with lots of cubby holes up front and some decent sized door cards the little 500e has a personality which is well known for being brilliant around town it has light steering it's easy to drive but of course it's always been a little bit knocked for its range this however does have the nice characteristics of still being very good around town having very light steering but you have the practicality of that additional range 250 miles is far better than the previous generation of Fiat products and it should be easily enough for most drivers especially those that will be using this car to commute to go to school and to go to the football on the weekends it's interesting they've launched this car within the B segment and making a big song and dance about how they've returned to the B segment this had me stumped for a little while because I thought this was quite similar to the 500x although they're claiming that the two cars are very different the 500x is a little bit taller it's more or SUV like whereas this is kind of just more of a slightly beefier hatchback which is why they've launched it in that b segment personally if you're going to have a car in the B segment I'd prefer to see something which was punto sized or perhaps something that's slightly closer related to the Peugeot e308 or the voxel Astra and then I'd like something even chunkier if we're going for a c-segment car but overall I think it offers a good amount of practicality while still fitting into that trendy SUV package interestingly it actually had me a little bit stumped when we watched the press conference and Fiat claimed this as their return to the B segment which I found a little bit odd to me the B segment has always been small compact cars like the Vauxhall Corsa or the Peugeot e208 this feels much larger but maybe it's all a bit of a placebo when it comes to how tall it is it has that SUV stance that's not necessarily a bad thing because it has that trendy SUV styling and it is a bit more practical but personally I would have preferred to have seen a more compact car and then make the SUV even more practical with more space in the back and more space in the boot this kind of sits in an odd in between area when it comes to ride Comfort I had the expectation of the Jeep Avenger in my mind because that car is pretty much exactly the same as the Fiat 600e and I've driven it recently and I would say they drive very similarly they're very quiet they're very Supple it's actually a very comfortable car to drive but the steering is notably lighter and I think Fiat have done that on purpose because they've always been well known as being light City cars it has that very light steering paired together with a pretty good turning Circle that does mean that when it comes to driver engagement a little bit of that is lost because it's not as taught as some of the other models it certainly isn't as nice to drive as the Peugeot e 2008 but if you want an everyday family car which is going to be really really easy to drive jump in jump out with no trouble then I think you're going to really enjoy this car it's been interesting driving both the Jeep Avenger and the 600e so close together because it's easy to compare the two cars after all well they're pretty much the same in their range they're charging statistics and they offer a pretty well-rounded package when it comes to space and interior quality or what I would say is a little bit of a lack of interior quality but it's clear that each one does have its own personality for me personally I'd be edging towards the styling of the Jeep but if you're after something a bit retro with that fear Edge then the 600e is going to be a great option do I love it quite as much as the 500 possibly not but I do think if you're looking for that similar quirky styling in a much more well-rounded package than the 600e is going to give you a new Choice into the market and choice is always a good thing but let me know what do you think of the 600e do you think I've been a little bit harsh on its styling let me know in

Fiat 600e Review,Electroheads
VokQJrHzBR8,some interesting things about the Fiat 600e I mean the way it looks the historical name the price the efficiency something even more interesting did you know that in the UK the most popular car color is gray now in 2022 alone in the UK there was 415 000 gray cars sold yeah Sophia have said no was that enough we're not doing it anymore we're doing big bold colors only no more gray no that's not gray shut up that's not gray that's that's the Earth of Italy so definitely not not gray right let's talk about the design of the car essentially this is the bigger sister of the 500e because you know how the 500e is like utterly adorable like the cutest thing you've ever seen this is definitely the bigger sister the reason I say that is because well it's 50 centimeters longer and also has a couple of extra doors but check out her eyes perfect eyeliner flick she's got resting sassy face and resting big sister sassy face you know like one of those so this is the first electric Fiat to be based on other stalantis cars like the Jeep Avenger for example which actually Ginny drove last week so we'll pop a link in the description below so you can watch that video if you like but the big bits that they've taken are things like the 54 kilowatt hour battery which returns 254 miles of wltp range there is something about the team at stalantis that are just really good at making efficient cars because that's 19 more miles than the Hyundai Kona that's 37 more miles than the mg4 SC it's all very very impressive oh and yeah just in case you were wondering we are in Italy at the Fiat Factory yes this is where they film The Italian Job I know right so unlike the Avenger the Fiat might have a sort of suvish look but it's not got any off-road pretensions instead it's meant to be nippy around town and very fun to drive and generally it is look this is very much designed to be a city car it is just a nice bigger version of the 500e except yeah it's just a little bit bigger isn't it this is this is comfortable in town I mean I haven't fully been able to put my foot down in it yet but look at this look I'm basically just driving with one finger this is how you know it's a city car because the steering is so light like really really light weirdly light your most kind of don't feel connected to the car in a way the driving is almost too easy if that makes sense so at the moment we're driving on these windy lovely country roads in Italy which I do have to say are very much like our British roads quite bumpy and quite pothole so we could do a proper test to kind of see how the 600e handles it and it has been crashing into potholes quite a bit now I have heard according to Ginny that the Jeep Avenger copes with the potholes pretty well but this has been this has been a little bit crashy at times even like you know when you kind of go over a drain and you feel like that Rumble and the clunk when you go over a drain yeah you're feeling that through the cabin quite a bit quiet though that's really quiet actually there is a brand new motor inside this which is apparently 50 quieter than its predecessor so that's probably why it's quiet we do have different Drive modes right so we have sport mode which makes it a little bit faster I guess the throttle is a little bit more responsive if you will it's got 154 horsepower we'll do naught to 62 in like nine seconds perfectly adequate you don't need it to be any faster than that we then have normal mode which is when you just drive normally really just like normal stuff and then you have eco mode which kind of slows everything down a little bit and it will reduce the performance a little bit it doesn't have the sherpa mode you know the sherpa mode in the 500e I don't know if you've heard about this but when you put it in Sherpa mode that is when you're at the point where you're starting to panic about the mileage that you've got in your car so you put it in Sherpa mode and it just switches everything off like all the aircon and stuff and gives you a speed limit of like 50 mile an hour or something silly to make sure that you can make it to your destination to charge a car this doesn't have that this just has eco mode I guess because the battery is a little bit bigger and it will get you further than a 500e so you shouldn't have to have that worry oh by the way wonderfully efficient so we check the numbers once we did our lovely drive around Italy and we were getting 4.7 miles per kilowatt hour that's not not too shabby oh we do need to test out the regen braking so there isn't like Flappy paddles or anything like that to kind of change the levels of things instead we have the standard B button B for regen which always makes sense or B for breaking that makes sense doesn't it yeah of course so let's see how well it does when we oh okay well you could feel that couldn't you well there's no one behind me shall we see if it comes to a complete stop or a creep it might go down to a creep down to a creep okay I mean that's fine the thing is is I I do think most of us are electrifying like myself and Ginny included are big fans of regen break-in especially when you can change the levels of region like I like full-blown hearty regen breaking that I can lift my foot off the pedal and I can feel the brakes working and I'll come down to a complete stop you won't get that in this okay here is where you're really going to notice that this is definitely a city car because we're currently on the equivalent of a Motorway if you will and it is noisy road noise wind noise all of the noise that's that's not the most relaxing experience while you're driving at speed better in town welcome to the interior of the Jeep Avenger the Fiat 600e sorry sorry I mean it's an easy mistake to make because it's basically exactly the same like completely the same layout I mean if you see them side by side yeah it looks exactly the same we've got the La Prima version by the way which is the top spec version so we have all the little Ivory bits and I do have to say these seats are very comfortable I do have to give a shout out to the seats I feel like I'm sat in them rather than on them if that makes sense now The Styling in here is quite nice it's very nice and simple like the Jeep Avenger we've got a 10 and a quarter inch screen for all of your entertainment stuff on there and in a tiny little screen behind the steering wheel for all your driving information there are some sort of cheap materials dotted about where it gets a bit scratchy plasticky no gloss black though which is a really good thing I've spotted two things where I think see it have maybe just forgotten about number one is the engine start stop button engine whereas it doesn't have a an engine and this it looks nice but this Flappy is actually just a bit irritating like I'd rather just not have it I mean when it's sort of tucked back here if you kind of keep it out the way because you've got something bigger there you now can't touch any of these buttons it's like one of those sort of cheap iPad covers that you buy I'd rather just not have that at all but but storage is fantastic so they've managed to access an extra 15 liters of space of storage in here because like there is so much space inside here there's wireless phone charging there's so much space in stone here does that lift up it does look at that door bins very decent size what's going on over here that's all that's a very nice size as well storage is cracking yeah just a few little bits that need tweaking huh this is smaller than I expected um that is set up for my driving position let me tell you this for free right when I'm sat in the back of the byd dolphin I can fully stretch my arms out when it's sat when it's set up for my driving position this is just a that's that's quite tight isn't it long-legged folk might struggle back here is there any like cup cup holders and no bit of charge in there for one person simple small and simple it's all right you know I'm pleasantly surprised by it you've got 360 liters of space which is like 20 less than the Jeep Avenger but look they had to find the space somewhere so clearly they just took the space from the rear seats so they could put more space in the boot which is kind of what I mean I mean two big bags in there it's all right it's all right right charging it will take up to 11 kilowatts from a wall box or 100 kilowatts from a DC fast charger so that means it could be less than half an hour to charge the battery to 80 percent hello okay let's get on to the important bit which we all know is the price so the red which is the entry level model is 32 995 pounds and the posha La Prima which is the one that we've got here is 36 995 pounds that makes it cheaper than the Avenger and the Kona and the Vauxhall Corsa with the same battery and motor as this as well but it's obviously more than the Chinese Rivals of mg and byd so what do we think well I mean they're reasonably priced I mean let's be honest fear is a really really popular brand in the UK a lot of people love the 500e so I think a lot of people will love the 600e I think it will be a big seller because of look at how adorable it looks the question is is in terms of price in terms of space in terms of range other Chinese Brands just gonna pivot to the post are they going to sell as

Fiat 600e - does the 500e’s bigger brother deliver la dolce vita? | Electrifying,Electrifying
ejT6GwY6cSY,hello this is the new Fiat 600 electric and it's a lot like the Fiat 500 electric but more 100 more okay but kidding aside important car this in fact I think you could go so far as to call this the most important electric Italian car that we've seen so far Fiat claims that what we have here is a practical rangy spacious yet small family car with a tasty price to boot and actually what I'm most excited about is that where so many of this car's Rivals tried to pull you in with needless acceleration and flashy features the Fiat is much more interested in two things that I am much more interested in comfort and efficiency if you like the fully charged show then you'll love our Live Events next up we're in Amsterdam for fully charged live Europe on the 24th 25th and 26th of November get your tickets today now then we're out on the road in the Fiat 600 electric worth noting we're just outside of Turin today uh I've opted to leave Turin to talk to the camera and film this video because as I very quickly learned during our microlino shoot here last year Shireen not the most relaxing place to film car reviews oh I was so lost already but as we were leaving the city I did do enough cobbly Street driving to ascertain that this is a nice comfortable car England is beaten perhaps only by Italy in terms of bumpiness of Road surface they love a cobble around here and this car is tuned accordingly it's an Italian car it's tuned for Italian roads therefore it's nice and squashy and that's just one of the things about this car that would make it an absolute Doddle to drive through town it is quite compact it's got a fairly short wheelbase meaning it's really really Nimble visibility is good the controls are so light in normal or eco mode you could steer it with a couple of fingers and you it's just a really easy relaxing car to move along the road very quiet very modest power as well I think barely 150 horsepower which is plenty for a car like this but not so much that you accidentally stress out all your passengers when you plant your foot so comfy quiet easy to drive one complaint actually no one pedal driving that's an absolute cardinal sin I can't believe that any new electric car is being released without it these days we've got drive and then we've got B which is the regen mode and if I take my foot off the throttle now there is the regen but it's not strong enough to bring the car to a complete stop which means I can't do one pedal driving and that is annoying design wise well I don't want to spend too long on this bit because big 500 in it that would be my concise summary you can see all the iconic design details we've got the circular lamps although they're split in half like they are on the 500 electric and as the law dictates this is of course a crossover so it's a little bit jacked up you've got the plastic cladding around the wheels it's just a little bit more chunk to it than it's smaller sibling it's a nice enough looking thing it's certainly nothing groundbreaking I actually think the most interesting thing about the way it looks is the color because Fiat have done away with gray they vowed never to offer any of their new cars in Gray ever again it's all part of their Endeavor to just create a more cheerful colorful brand identity and I like that more orange cars please anyway enough about that I think much more interesting than the design is the size of this vehicle because you could well be looking at this thinking oh great another medium-sized crossovery thing but actually this is a small sized crossover effect it's more compact than just about any other electric family car you'd care to mention 4.1 meters long it's shorter than an mg4 so dinky little car but one that claims to offer big space inside that's one of the big selling points of the 600 according to Fiat is that true we'll find out in a moment when we put a Jack in the back but I can show you this for starters a class leading sized boot at 360 liters look at that that's a pretty big boot for a pretty small car decent sized opening flat floor false floor underneath it good to see one complaint with the boots is that it sounds like a reversing rubbish truck coming at you when it closes and then at the end it slaps it's quite stressful a small gripe a couple of other numbers while I'm at it 51 kilowatt hour usable that's the only batch entry available on the 600 and that is good for 250 miles of wltp range 250 miles from 51 kilowatt hours of battery efficiency more on that later that's 375 miles of urban range by the way seriously impressive numbers and here's one final number for you and this is an important one 33 000 pounds that is the entry price for the Fiat 600e now people get cross when I use the word affordable to describe cars that cost 30 something thousand pounds and I understand that but let's be clear that makes this one of the absolute cheapest five-seater long-range electric family cars really only the mg4 comes in underneath this with anywhere near as much range that is an impressive price well we're lost in the outskirts of Turin and forced to turn around and shamefully retrace my footsteps but let's just take a moment to acknowledge a crisp that reversing camera is also very very tight turning circle on on the car which makes it really really easy to uh oh squeeze down Tony ancient medieval Italian strings like these foreign [Music] welcome to reviews of cars going backwards the did not think would be testing the reversing camera quite this thoroughly today [Music] now inside the Fiat 600 electric and it's a continuation of the cheerful Italian Vibes we get from the outside what have we got then well a lot of this is reminding me of the Jeep Avenger again a car that will share a lot of bits with this one because they're both stalantis products same platform same Bank of physical buttons here for things like climate control and demisting this is going to make a lot of people happy just big physical easy to hit buttons and look there's more of them on the wheel it's not haptic and I don't have to open a menu within a menu to change my fan speed nice to see I think on the whole this is still the preferred method of fiddling with things like your climate isn't it especially when it's done in a way that doesn't necessarily clutter the cabin and I don't feel that this does I like this little Bank of buttons to select your gear as well that's quite a nice little touch this I'm a fan of this kind of slightly magnetic iPad cover-esque lid for the glove box in which I find a bit of storage a wireless charger more storage cup holders little teeny bit of storage in there nice little rubbery shelf here just to put your key in it doesn't go flying storage is what I'm trying to say to you storage and again bearing in mind that this is one of the cheapest electric family cars on sale you don't necessarily feel hyper aware of that in here when you touch stuff in the mg4 it feels a bit affordable it'll be fair to say but actually they've put nice materials in all the important places here to make it feel good at least at first impression so got nice Supple material on the steering wheel this on the higher spec version is a faux leather that actually feels really plush and soft and I like I like the Fiat stitching in there now the eagle-eyed among you may have noticed this which can only be described as a gear tunnel and yes this car is not sitting on bespoke EV architecture it's what stalantis calls a multi-energy platform there will be a hybrid version of this car there won't be a pure ice version but both of them sit on the same architecture and designed to accommodate both now the pro of that for Fiat for stalantis is it's a fairly affordable and efficient way of building cars which enables them to keep the price low the disadvantage is of course space we do have a bit of room in there but there would be more were it not for the fact that space has been saved for the gearbox of the hybrid version and in the back is where you are most affected in my opinion now we know I'm tall that's well documented but if I'm being completely honest with you I basically couldn't get into that back seat not in my driving position not even when I scooch forward to the safest most forward driving position that I would be okay with it's barely room for me to get my feet in back there good Headroom mind you just the leg room is a little cramped back there and again I am unusually tall I think a normal person driving you'll be able to fit a normal person behind them just fine and it's also worth noting that these B segment cars have never been spacious historically it's always been a square trees in the back in these smaller cars but if this were sitting on bespoke EV architecture like the mg4 for example you'd be able to get a proper sized human back there and that is a big big thing that the mg has over this car my main issue with this interior is this screen the software is great it's intuitive it's reasonably quick but the screen's the wrong size it's very long and thin which means when I pull up my navigation I can see what's to the left and right of me but not very far in front [Music] and then here's the thing I'm potentially most excited about with this car it is bloody efficient today we've been doing all sorts of driving uphill downhill City mountains twisty straight we've done the lot and without even thinking about efficiency without even trying to drive in an efficient manner I've achieved wait for it just under nine kilowatt hours per 100 kilometers what on Earth is that in human language I think that's well clear of six miles to the kilowatt hour that's a big efficiency and I'm not going to do my whole long spiel about why efficiency is such a big deal in electric cars because I'm sure a lot of you have heard it before but the short version is it's not just about getting you further on a charge it's also about enabling Fiat to put less battery in each car enabling them to sell them cheaper making the cars Greener making them lighter and more enjoyable oh I did the Spiel I did it by accident but it makes everything better when a car is efficient and efficiency is still so under prioritized in electric vehicle design so this is great to see and how have they achieved it well they've done it by making this a relatively small and light car relatively oh loony they've done it with a much more efficient design of motor for these V2 cars the same motor going into the new Jeep Avenger which I'll be driving soon but they've also done it by just not overpowering the car they've given it a modest little motor and remove the temptation to drive it in a silly way I have actually been driving an eco mode this whole time because it doesn't matter it's not a sporty car I have no desire to drive it sportly so then first impressions of this new Fiat 600 Electric well in short positive I would say I mean first of all let's just acknowledge the fact that there is still so few electric cars of this size at this price point that I'm just happy to see another one show up anytime it does but this does appear to be a pretty impressive one and look we'll need to spend a bit more time with this car before passing final judgment but I think what we can confidently say from our first day with it is that it's efficient affordable easy to use and cheerful and there's not many electric cars that you could apply all four of those words to so it's a pretty good start so there we go then the Fiat 600 electric please make sure to like And subscribe and if you have been thanks for watching support our stop burning stuff patreon and help us tackle

bxgXvFlt9aY,you don't need me to tell you the Italians are great at building characterful cars they've been making them for decades take the latest Fiat 500e it's not just charismatic for an Italian car but it's the most Charming EV on sale right now full stop Fiat wants to re-establish itself as the master of smaller cars and to do so it's returning to the B segment hatchback Market the last time Fiat was here was in 2018 with the punto [Music] but Fiat is back with not one but two new models there's a brand new Fiat Panda coming next year but in the meantime there's this the all-new Fiat 600e oh it's the new bigger brother to the 500e and it's a family hatchback but with a slightly rugged crossover look but beneath the 500 design cues the 600e shares a lot with its sister car the Jeep Avenger when I say share I mean it basically Nicks the Jeep's platform it's 154 brake horsepower electric motor and it's 54 kilowatt hour battery pack which also happens to be the same Hardware as the Peugeot e2008 as well it's an easy reason for all of this they're all built by stellantis so there's a lot of family love going on here even the dashboard is taken pretty much Lock Stock and Barrel from the Jeep Avenger but there are some Fiat retro touches like on this La Prima version we've got this Ivory colored panel on the dashboard and the seats they're embossed with the Fiat logo probably to remind you what car you're driving if you've forgotten aside from these features though and the strange cover that looks like an iPad cover that hides the central cubby there isn't quite the same Delight that you get in the 500e and while Everything feels robust there are too many scratchy Plastics on the dash and on the doors for my liking the infotainment system works well though there's decent space in the back boot room stands at 360 liters but only La Prima models get a movable boot floor prices start at a reasonable 32 995 for the entry-level red model and rise to 36.995 for the La Prima which means the 600e undercuts the Avenger and the E 2008 but not the mg4 if you want a charging cable though fear to relieve you of 400 pounds which seems a bit stingy to me what's it like to drive then well if you're expecting this to be a typical electric car an absolutely fly towards the horizon when you put your foot on the throttle then you're going to be disappointed because this is not a quick car not to 62 miles now takes nine seconds and if you put this car in eco mode which you probably will if you want to eke out that claimed 250 mile range it feels that you're not going anywhere at all but I'm probably being a little bit too harsh because this is a family SUV after all or family crossover hatchbacking do you really want Lightning Fast reactions in your family car probably not the acceleration is probably more than good enough now I do like the ride it is particularly good in this 600e it's probably the best ride aside from the ec4 of all of these stellantis electric crossover SUVs now we're driving this car in the home of Fiat Turin and the roads are as crumbly as you'll find in Britain and this car has just sailed over them you do get the sense that when you hit a pothole it sort of Glides over you hear the wheel go in the pothole we don't necessarily feel it and that really does bode well for the car in the UK the steering is very light it's more than accurate enough but it does feel a little bit light although I would say happily it does weight up when you pick your speed up [Music] this is a very likable car and one that I think would be very easy to live with I also think it'll be a strong seller here in Britain because we love Italian chic the 600e is also the best example of a larger Fiat 500 I've seen but there's still the feeling that the 600es character is just a little Skin Deep the 500e it's the real deal foreign I suppose what I'm trying to say is that the 600e doesn't woo you like the 500e does but what the 600e lacks in Charisma it makes up in usability this is a well-priced and spacious family SUV crossover EV hatchback call it what you will this is a great all-rounder it just doesn't make you want to own it unconditionally,2023-09-25,Fiat 600e review – Bigger but better than the Fiat 500e? | batchreviews (James Batchelor),batchreviews
HLquNEYSKWk,"[Music] the fat 500 has long been a hit with the fashionistas of this world so much so that they even made a Gucci version but it's always had one big problem and that's the fact that it isn't big it's been really small which is why fat has produced this the new 600 well technically this one's a 600e but just like the hybrid version that'll join it later this year it gets more doors more space and more style or at least does it have enough of those three things to lure you fashion Easter away from a in Alternatives like the mini Countryman the Ford Puma or the pjo 2008 it certainly has a good go at it with a dying price of $29,995 thanks to the £3,000 discount that at the time of filming is being offered by f on it EVS it makes the 600e a full 7 Grand cheaper than a Kia e Nero and 500 crit cheaper than the mgzs and it helps to alleviate some of the 600s quite significant shortfalls which we'll reveal in this video after talking fashion now the first rule of being fashion able is to look stylish and the 600 definitely has a good go at doing that come with me down here because you'll spot the first of many 600 badges across this car in fact we're going to count them as we walk around it but I think it wears it proudly just like any kind of fashion item that wears its logo everywhere Anyway come with me around here and you'll spot the first familiar part of the car to the 500 E this headlight with its so-called eyeliner but I think it looks a bit stoned well yeah this is obviously a carryover of what you got in the 500d it looks quite smart here with another 600 badge down here the wheels on this La Prima top spec car are 17 in on the base red car red as in the trim level not the color you only get hub caps with Steels this is a bigger wheel therefore it's probably heavier but it is a flat design and doesn't have many openings so it should be good for range although we'll test that a bit later and your spot it's got a studded design as well if you follow me down to the side skirt another 600 badge albe it's just half of one another one there and then another 600 badge on a tail light cluster that looks very familiar from the 500 E I like this u-shaped design here you'll spot the studs they match those on the wheels so stylish I think first fat badge that we've spotted and we've got this spoiler up here and then if you cast your gaze down there we have ourselves another 600 badge with an Italian flag in case you forgetting where this car's [Music] from and the last one is on the steering wheel now the interior overall is definitely a bit of an improvement on the 500 when it comes to space because obviously there's more of the stuff especially above me here and also you've got a nice setup around you I've got a digital instrument cluster as standard ahead of me plus an infotainment system here and that infotainment system is actually pretty good the thing I like about it is it's fast it's responsive you've got Wireless Apple carplay and Android auto and plus you've got shortcuts so it's easy to navigate around even if you you get lost you also have tactile and manual buttons for your climate control so if you don't want to fiddle with the screen well you just press buttons down here which is nice and they're quite long so if you've got long nails they should be easy to use and all the weighting and everything just feels quality but also very easy now it's a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to storage in the car because while it's definitely a lot better than the 500 E compared to some of the rivals it's not the best in the class although you still have a decent amount of space you got space down here to put cups and mug or whatever space in here as well and it's quite deep and then under this cover you've got a wireless charging M and a couple of USB C's as well as a 12volt port but you've got this clumsy iPad cover style thing here which I mean firstly it looks like it's going to get a bit dirty quite quickly and secondly it's always in the way apart from when it's down so that's not ideal and then you've also got this flat patch up here which is rubbery which looks like it's supposed to take your phone but you're going to put your phone in there so I guess maybe it's for your passenger and I have to say the door pockets are quite narrow I can't get my keep Cup in there and I can't get my refillable water bottle in there so yes you can put them here but I like having it in the door sometimes so that's a small negative up front overall though it's a nice stylish place to sit and I really like the finish with the cream and the black but I have to show you possibly the worst thing in the front of the interior and that is the glove box which is Tiny now obviously the back seats are where the key advantage over the 500 ears because here we've got three of them and obviously it's bigger as well I've got way more Headroom and I can fit technically it's snug but my knees fit and my feet fit as well so this isn't really a place for fully grown adults not for long Journeys anyway but for a teenager or for a kid well yeah it's okay although you don't get a few Creature Comforts that you'd think come as standard in 2024 firstly there's no armrest to fold out of this seat here so there are no cup holders as well plus you've only got one USBC port and no ven and you don't even get door Pockets down there so if you've got a bottle or a cup well you're going to have to hold it unless you can seal it and put it in this here I mean it's not great at least the windows go down all the way which isn't common these days properly all the way down and isopix bars are very easy to access something is telling me this back seat interior is designed for very small kids all those in child seats rather than anything bigger now you won't be surprised to hear that the boot of the 600 is much bigger than the boot of the 500 the 500 boot is Tiny by any standard whereas here we've got a pretty usable amount of space so much so that it swallows jal's camera bag with ease and handily you've got some underfloor storage as well to hide away your charge cable in this electric car I'd expect that floor space underneath to grow a bit when the hybrid model comes later this year but even so this is comparable with a big hatchback although it's definitely not the biggest in the class I think that title will go to other model models including maybe the mini Countryman or the Ford pummer which has that amazing underfloor storage space but it's okay oh yeah and we can also confirm that the electric tailgate won't chop your kids' hands off which is good now we just need to find out if the 600 drives as nicely as the 500 or if it feels like the lazier heavier puzle now behind the wheel of this 600 you really do feel that fashionista Vibe right away and that's because it gets all of those Vogue Essentials that are fitted to the 5 00 I'm looking at the same dashboard that you get in a 500e and that's a really nice place to be so that feeling that emotion carries over into this 600 I was expecting it to feel a little bit like uh a bit slobby and a bit a bit less nice to steer down a road versus the 500 which is a good driving car but actually on this bumpy section of British B- road that we're on not only does it ride nicely but it also steers nicely as well it feels effortless all the controls are very light touch all feels good quality as well and the same goes even for the indicator stalks and the buttons that you touch everything just feels well judged and well matched to make life easy and make driving very simple now you do get a bunch of Drive modes you get just three you've got an Eco you've got a normal and you've got a sport and the normal is as you'd expect it makes the car feel nippy energetic but not particularly rapid all right let's get into sport see how it changes the car cuz we're on a twisty road now and yeah instantly I can feel that acceler ation is better I mean fear claims are not to 62 time if you're interested of 9 seconds which is nippy certainly nippy enough for Town and Country and Motorway driving and because this car steers and rides so nicely it's actually quite fun to drive there is one minor gripe I've noticed from behind the wheel and that is that there is a little bit of road noise all the time as the road surface changes you'll definitely hear the coarser sounds coming through the car it's not overly intrusive but it's one to know and because obviously there's no engine noise in this electric version well there's nothing to drown it out although having said that who drives with the radio off St in sport here's a launch yeah it's nippy not quick is it it's not a neck breaker no not a neck breaker now what about the Turning Circle in this car let's give it a go there's no one around me that's not bad it's okay it's okay I mean that's definitely up there with with cars of this class better than your petrol ones I would say um it's not too bad I mean I almost did a proper U-turn there on a B- Road right reversing camera hopefully no Angry farmers will come out who could be angry with such a happy looking car right visibility is really good even without the camera actually I can see around the car very clearly but the camera is very useful it's nice and sharp and I've got a 3D above view as well which means not only am I aware of what's behind me but I I can also see what's around me and even in front of me a little bit so that's quite good and then you can also make the view bigger and focus it entirely on the reversing camera itself rather than that above you so that's good good visibility easy to drive done a bit of wheel spin oh trash control there oh yeah and on the subject of driving Tech this car has plenty of driver assistance features you get a real long list including Lan keep assist and adaptive cruise control but also really really good is that there's a home button for the infotainment screen and there's also a car button so you press that and it shortcuts you to your driver assistance features and you can turn them off and you can even save that button so that it will turn off some of those features just to press of it now I'm into a village and I can see that it's really easy to thread it through these narrow Lanes not only does the car respond quite keenly but also my visibility is great I can see where the Bonnet is front and left look I'm having to break to let this guy go and I know there's loads of space in fact everything's happening it feels like I'm on my driving test people reversing out of driveways but I feel confident that even if someone pulled out of me I've got a car Nimble and agile enough and able to squeeze through gaps enough that I don't have to worry too much God I'm really enjoying driving this little thing actually it's not even that listful but it feels it and that's what matters when you're not driving around in circles and you actually want to make progress the 600e and its compact 54 kwh battery can eal 254 Mi on a mixed driving route it's quick to charge too with a 100 Kow plug compatib ability ensuring a rapid charge time of under 30 minutes although if speed is your priority you might want to wait for the abbath version of the car which will trade on range for a hot 240 horsepower output cannot wait for that all right so if you're looking for a 500e that's more spacious and just as stylish the 600e definitely offers all of those things although there are Rivals that are more practical and definitely more spacious inside but with the price tag of this thing especially with that SP discount well I think it's very very competitive but if you want to see how this car Stacks up to similar SUVs watch this video here",2024-03-27,A FUN Family Car?! New Fiat 600 Review - & Why The Ford Puma's Worried,cinch
1OWaEGStiA0,[Music] thank you [Music] foreign,2023-06-09,New Fiat 600e (2024) | FIRST LOOK,Planet Car News
FknVzDA15bE,"the Fiat 500e is among one of my favorite small-sized electric vehicles but the 600e is its larger sibling now at the time of filming and in the UK the manufacturer is offering £3,000 off the list price at least for retail customers meaning that the 600e starts from just shy of £30,000 while if you go for the topspec La Prima it will come in at just £34,000 so it is review seeing if it's actually worth its price tag and how it compares to some of its competitors so to kick things off let's talk about Electric range and very much like other vehicles from the stantis group the Fiat 600e houses the same 54 KW hour grow or 51 Kow hour net battery pack there is also a heat pump that comes included as standard which is certainly appreciated the manufacturer claims that you will get roughly 253 mil at least on the wltp test cycle however from my own mixed driving test I ned between 200 to 220 Mi which ironically is absolutely identical to what I actually netted in the Jeep Avenger now it's worth considering however that the 600e is significantly cheaper than the Jeep Avenger and it's also a lot better in terms of the overall range in comparison to the Fiat 500e as you'll be able to see from this mileage leaderboard where the latter actually got roughly 140 to 160 mi from my own mix driving test suffice to say that the 600e actually does fair pretty well specifically considering its overall price tag now for you to be as efficient as possible there is a degree of regenerative braking and there is a button that is found towards the center console right now I'm in B mode so I'm just going to accelerate a little bit towards this bus and then lift off and as you'll be able to see that the vehicle starts decelerating relatively rapidly but in my opinion it's not as harsh as it should be indeed you haven't got a one pedal drive the same sort of complaint was said about all of the other vehicles from the stantis group it would have been great if there was a degree of customization or indeed that full one pedal drive because it makes those inner city drives a little less cumbersome now of course you do have the ability of plugging it in and VI C CS Port it will take up to 100 KW of input therefore allowing you to go from 20 to 80% in just 27 minutes VI its type 2 Port it has actually got an 11 KW onboard charger and therefore if you do have access to a three-phase power supply you can go from 0 to 100% in 5 hours and 45 minutes while if you do connect it up to a regular wallbox it'll take you roughly 8 hours while a 3 pin socket will take you over 30 hours so what about when it comes to Performance well here there is a single front mounted motor which dispatches all the power to the front wheels anded you've got a front-wheel drive configuration now in its sport mode preset you will get the maximum amount of power 115 KW or 154 horsepower and 260 Newt M of torque in the normal mode this drops down to 80 KW or 109 horsepower and 220 newon met of torque and in eco mode it goes down to 60 KW or 82 horsepower and 180 Newton M of torque now I actually she had it tested using race logic's performance box touch from 0 to 20 mph in 2.44 seconds 0 to 30 mph in 3.68 seconds 0 to 60 mph in 8.65 seconds and notes that is pretty much bang on to the manufacturer 0 to 62 mph claim of 9 seconds and then 50 to 70 mph in 4.78 seconds and a peak acceleration of just 0.3 HG top speed is rated at 93 mph now indeed the vehicle performance is quite lackluster specifically if you consider some of the Alternatives out there on the market but nonetheless I do think it will certainly suffice for most consumers what's more important however is the overall driving comfort and in this respect the vehicle is actually tuned to Perfection now sure enough its suspension system is a little bit stiff in comparison to some Alternatives out there even from the stellantis group themselves with the likes of the Citron ec4 or EC 4X but in this respect it's far superior than the Jeep Avenger which suffered from low-end resonance when traversing on uneven terrain that's not the case in the 600e so I'm very pleased to see that Fiat has actually thought about the insulating material furthermore the steering wheel is actually very light making the vehicle very easy to maneuver but on the flip side it does mean that the Fiat doesn't exactly inight that overall driver's feel or indeed that level of confidence when you're going around winding country routes this is in part due to the fact that youve got a front-wheel drive configuration and that you also suffer from a bit of body roll if you're going to be really chucking around winding country routs so aside from how is on the road what about when it comes to its interior design well given the overall price point of the 600e and also the Fiat pedigree I've actually got no complaints whatsoever it certainly does stand out in comparison to for example the mg4 EV yes indeed you have got really nice stitching work around the upholstery you've got nice use of materials towards the dashboard and even in terms of the door frames the overall design and the look of it certainly is there of course you're still going to get some cheap plastic around the dashboard but I've not got any major complaints I also love the fact that Fiat has preserved some physical buttons you'll find them on the steering wheel and also towards the dashboard where they'll serve as shortcut buttons for the infotainment system for example your climate controls you've also still got a physical knob for the volume now as for the infotainment system it's actually very responsive you've got a 10.25 in display which has got a pretty intuitive feel to it at least when you get your head around it it also supports Android auto and apple carplay over a wide and wireless trans Mission it's worth noting if you do want the built-in navigation system you'll have to go for the LA primat Trim because it's not available in the entry level red model now no matter if you're using the built-in navigation system or the thirdparty mobile operating systems you will be pleased to know that turn-based navigation data does feed through to the 7in instrument cluster indeed this fully digitalized display does provide you all the key information that you require and it's good to see that level of integration is also there which isn't the same that could be said about some of its Rivals if it is a shame however that a head-up display is not offered be it in the more expensive trim level or indeed available as an option speaking of which there's no means of actually changing the audio system because in the entry-level red trim you'll have a four speaker setup while in the lapr Prima model you'll have a six speaker configuration the latter does relatively well across the sound frequency range and will keep most people excited but it's certainly not going to compete with more audio file Centric products out there so moving on let's talk about storage and towards the front of the cabin you've got the glove box although it's a shame that it's not been optimized for right-and drive vehicles which I do think is quite lazy from the manufacturer nonetheless you have got the door bins where they'll accommodate a 500ml bottle with ease alongside some small to mediumsized valuables it's a shame yet again not to see any sort of fabric material therefore meaning that your loose change or keys will be heard rattling about when you're traversing uneven terrain now towards the center of the dashboard you'll find a small little cubby hole which can be handy for placing your wireless key fob or your wallet or small small size purse and then you have got a 15 L compartment which is comprised underneath an iPad light cover this is also removal if you so wish here you'll find a wireless charger which is present in the topspec La Prima trim and then you'll find a 12volt socket alongside a USB type A and type- C Port the latter is used for connecting up to the infotainment system there is another USB type-c port that is found towards the rear of the center console so moving down the center console you'll find a small customizable area with the small little plastic ins allowing you to place let's say a can or small size water bottle or indeed you can fully open it up for that increased amount of storage you have also gots the small compartment that is found within the center armrest although it's relatively narrow so you're not going to fit any sort of large size Goods as for the rear of the cabin it's pretty limited you have not got a pull down armrest compartment for your cup holders and the door bins are pretty much non-existent now of course you have got its boots where you've got 360 L to play around with or if you drop down the seats 1,231 L Which is far superior than its smaller sibling the 500e which SATs at 185 and 550 lers respectively sure enough it's not exactly class leading figures but it will certainly suffice for doing your weekly shops furthermore it's actually pretty practical with a hatchback design you've also got 6040 rear s split folding seats in the La Prima model you'll also have an adjustable boot floor which means that you have got a small little underfloor compartment for your charging cables and you've also got an electric tailgate that comes fitted as standard and top spec variant now I should also point out that the rear seats have not got any sort of seat belt Runners which makes it a little bit more cumbersome if you're going to be dropping down the seats regularly a complaint that I have about some of its competitors as well but just something I thought I should highlight in the 600e now as for the overall seating Comfort I've got no issues whatsoever the seats themselves are actually very accommodating and soft at the front you will also find in the La Prima model that they become heated and also you have got six-way electronic controls for the driver's seat with a massage function function which is very much appreciated now as for Headroom towards the rear of the cabin it's a little bit limited but certainly should suffice given that the vehicle itself is pretty compact however leg room is going to be a bit of an issue specifically if you're transporting adults it of course won't be a problem if you have got children or younger adults but it's just something worth highlighting so see if you're comparing this vehicle to slightly larger SUVs it's also further disappointing that you still have a transmission tunnel in a fully electric vehicle moving swiftly on let's talk about it exterior design and I'll be curious to know what you make of it down the comment section below subjectively I don't think it's as cute looking as the 500e but it still has got that stylish profile and of course that is due to fiat's DNA at the front you'll see it thanks to the headlights and the Bonnet and towards the side you have actually got 16in steel wheels which actually don't look too bad in the red trim while in the La Prima model you'll have much more stylish 18in diamond cut Alloys it is a shame however that the automaker has still preserved plastic wheel archers and S skirts but thankfully they don't protrude Too Much from the exterior shell as for the rear I've got no complaints whatsoever it fits in with fiat's other vehicles and still preserves the remnants of the 500e now as for your color options the red model comes as with the name suggest in red as standard however you can go for a black or white finish for an additional £600 the La Prima model however really UPS the anti with the sea Earth sky or sun of Italy finishes really standing out in comparison to what else you can find out there on the market so what about when it comes to safety well at the time of filming the Fiat 600e has not been tested by Euro encap so I can't talk about it overall crash safety scores but what I can comment about are the driver assistance systems now as standard on both trim levels you'll find cruise control and intelligent speed assistant drowsy driver detection traffic sign information autonomous emergency break Lane keep assist which by the way can actually be pretty easily disabled by pressing a shortcut button found on the dashboard and then going on the infotainment system and disabling set option and in the La Prima model you'll find blind spot detection with adaptive cruise control which actually does work a treat on the motorway keeping you at a safe distance from the leading vehicle now as for parking and visibility it's a little bit Limited at least towards the front as someone who's just under 6t I feel that the placement of the rear viiew mirror does obscure some of my frontal Vision the same complaints were said of pretty much every single vehicle reviewed from the stantis group nonetheless the apas are relatively thin and you've got good openings towards the side the same could be said towards the rear also thanks to the fact that you have also got a wiper although it's pretty disappointing that you've only got rear parking sensors in the red trim if you want front side and rear parking sensors and also 180° camera then you'll actually have to Splash out on the La Prima trim so with all that in mind it brings me on to my verdict and truthfully I was actually taken back by the Fiat 600e sure enough it shares many similarities with other vehicles from the stantis group with perso voxel Citron and even Jeep however it does stand out in comparison to its siblings and even indeed its competitors it's very stylish both inside and out it also has got good use of Technology within the cabin and plenty of driver assistance systems that come featur their standard you've also got a more practical design thank to its larger boot in comparison to the smaller 500e more importantly however it's pretty comfortable to drive and also has got a decent electric range combining all of this at a tempting price of roughly 30 to £34,000 depending on which trim level you go for and it makes this vehicle easy to recommend as such it gets Our Best Buy award now I'll be curious to know what you make of the 600e down the comment section below and if you would pick it over some of its Rivals if you have enjoyed this detailed independent review definitely do consider dropping a like subscribing and hitting that Bell notification all of which would be greatly appreciated as such I've been Chris from to
