2023-07-21,SpeakEV,hi there we will receive our new fiat 500e icon 2 months ahead of schedule so im not very prepared will the car come with a charging cable do i need a home ev charger or can it be plugged into an ordinary house socket if i do get an ev charger which one should i get there are so many out there tia camille
2023-08-17,SpeakEV,hi there i have ordered a fiat 500e icon on lease which will come in march i had ordered a 208 gt premium petrol but they have had a recall on the car and delivery will be god knows when and i need to make sure i had a car for when my current lease went back end of march to startmid april so i took the plunge as i wanted a ev i do not drive far tbh and this car was really the only one i could afford at the time i ordered it about a week agoother cars have prices raised alot and alot of cars and petrol ones have 8 weeks delivery some i have seen 6 months wait lol anyway for the time being i will not be getting a home charger as the prices of them are ridiculous i am sure they are charging way way over the odds for them 7001200 there have been a few for 549 etc but these are with the grant off which if i tried to order now would be too late anyway as they do not have slots for instillation before the grant ends and so id be paying full priceliterally can not afford it plus i am pretty sure we would need something upgraded with the main fuse too i plan on using public chargers there is a pub near me that has a free 50kw charger long as you are in the pub me and my friend meet once a month for fee and usually in there atleast 3 hrs talking so it should give decent range and there are others locally that you pay for but still cheaper than petrol i do not mind using a granny cable at home for inbetween tbh anyway the question is what cables come with the car as in the description it just stays charging cable mode 3 would that be the 7kw one where you can either plug it into a home wall charger and public chargers that are 7kw do you get the granny cable at all as i do not fancy paying 170 for one many thanks

2023-09-26,SpeakEV,is there a way to delete not just unselect a charging schedule on the car ie return to empty before i got the wallbox i scheduled a care charge just as part of getting to know the car i never used it it remained unselected im now having big charging issues hard to tell if the problem is the car or the wallbox or if they are confusing each other so wondered if i could completely delete the car schedule to minimise confusion id also be interested in any other feedback about the wallbox fiat 500e i think the fundamental problem is more likely to be to do with the wallbox thank you
2023-08-18,SpeakEV,hello everyone i have bought a fiat 500e icon 2022 it is also my first car i have a few questions how easy is it for a fiat 500e to get stolen what things can i do so it makes it harder for anyone to steal do i need a faraday pouch secondly if anyone has a babychild have you put a baby seat in the back and how has it been for you im thinking to have a baby in a few years and my hp will last for 3 years so there will be some overlap before i get a diff car so may need to put a baby seat in i also dont have a drop kerb and with some manoeuvring i can use my neighbours drop kerbhow badly would the car suspension get damaged if i drive off without using my neighbours drop kerb do you have any other general advice for first time car owners thank you in advance
2022-02-03,SpeakEV,hi all i was wondering if anyone had any advice i collect my fiat 500e this weekend it comes with a free wall charger the easywallbox be engie however i am struggling to get anyone to install it it can be plugged into a standard mains outlet for 23kw or installed properly for 7kw it has a dpm sensor for monitoring the load on the main fuse ive got a call with western power i am in south wales to takes us off a loop and upgrade our fuse to 80a from 63a and so far i have had two installers say they cannot help as they are not accredited for that charger i contacted fiat and they said to contact engie engie said they do not keep a list of installer and instead just sent me the installation manual for installers all the other installers ive contacted have either not responded to their contact me form or dont answer the phone has anyone had any luck getting this charger installed i appreciate that most people would just get a podpoint or something installed instead of the fiat one if they had to buy one

2024-02-24,SpeakEV,do any other 500e drivers have issues with the intelligent speed assist system my la prima seems to identify signs correctly but after a period of not seeing a sign it checks the sat nav and it appears to convert the sat nav speed from km to miles so a 30 sat nav signal displays as 20 mph 60 as 40mph etc lovely car but this software bug is very annoying and fiat does not seem to have any answers
2023-07-14,SpeakEV,we spent 12 days out of 143 during the fiat 500e ev road trip in orkney watch the full length video to see the best places we visited on the beautiful islands my verdict on the charging situation on the orkney islands mediocre especially when you compare it to the situation in shetland where charging is much easier and more rapid chargers are well distributed in the orkney islands however you are better off taking the electric vehicle only on the orkney mainland stromness kirkwall finstown st margarets hope and dounby have some rapid chargers and they work and a couple of 22kw chargers on the mainland however the other islands have no chargers at all not even a slow charger saying that we took a day trip to westray with a fully charged battery which was not a problem thanks to the short distances on this island i suppose you can do the same with the isle of hoy after all we never had charging problems never range anxiety never an almost empty battery so on the mainland it wasnt too bad if you get yourself organised and dont wait until the last minutepercentage to recharge follow our road trip live we travel until the end of september 2023 ev photo tour 2023 findpenguins 10000 miles 10 countries 192 photo spots all electrical with the fiat 500e read the journal for ev road trip tips photo spots and vegan food experiences findpenguinscom
2023-08-03,SpeakEV,i enjoy driving our little fiat 500e over in california and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the uk most of the non ev parts are standard fiat 500 so in theory it shouldnt be too expensive to maintain standard wear items tyres brakes wipers etc some inexpensive reliable fiat 500e 2013 models here in california can be found for less than 5000 looking at the cost to ship from the us to the uk should be less than 1000 according to how much does shipping a car overseas cost costhelper once this pandemic has declined im sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the uk but not sure about the current uk car inspection requirements looking at the vat impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the eu if that even matters anymore for almost two years essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard fiat 500 especially safety elements so i would think there would be no additional inspection items required heres an example of a 2016 500e for 5991 httpswwwcarscomvehicledetaildetail828502330overview any thoughts or am i totally crazy
2022-09-12,SpeakEV,hiya we have just had delivered a new fiat 500e la prima which we love but some how i have activated a setting where the car beeps the horn when locking scanned the handbook etc but cant find the answer any ideas thanks
2021-09-07,SpeakEV,hi we are close to ordering a new fiat 500e but i am interested in the service intervals and cost the dealer are saying the intervals are every 12 months or 9000 miles is this correct for an electric car surely there is nothing much to service as it has very little moving parts if anybody has knowledge of this any information would be appreciated
2023-10-01,SpeakEV,my rented 500e is one year old today i got it in january seemingly new with only delivery mileage as its my responsibility to organise servicing although i dont pay for it does anyone know the intervals is it due its first one now

2022-12-02,SpeakEV,the fiat forum looks quiet so just a short post here to see if i can catch some advice weve been offered a 500e as a rental car but would like to know if it will cover my wifes daily 100 mile round trip commute at 6070mph all the way heating on etc our zoe uses about 40kwh to do that in todays weather so the fiats 42kwh battery seems a bit tight unless its efficiency is better than the zoe thanks for any advice
2024-04-17,SpeakEV,hello i picked up this 2023 fiat 500e icon edition yesterday and want to get it working with the fiat app i have done this but while the car shows up it doesnt show very much i appear to have aconnect one subscription until 2033 but wonder if i have to buy the connect plus annual sub in order to see such info as battery state of charge etc can anyone please advise cheers eugene
2023-08-09,SpeakEV,were thinking of replacing my wifes 2011 toyota verso s with an ev as it should suit her low mileage circa 3k per year were thinking of the fiat 500 electric as the icon 42kwh versions are currently circa 20k used for a 2022 model low mileage 10k miles i thought id ask opinions on it and if its a good choice
2019-02-13,SpeakEV,i just bought a fiat 500e and i love it i live in provo and there are public charge points everywhere last night the day after i bought the car it was keyed by someone straight to the metal i live in a rather good part of town and it was in a private drive for the night unfortunately i have to park on the street most of the time and the car is bright orange i learned due to gentrification there is a huge antitech sentiment here akin to san francisco ive bought a camera and switched up my insurance but that doesnt help for the damage already done what on earth could i do to prevent this from happening again is it safe to leave it at public charging ports what if they do something worse like snapping the charge port while unattended
2022-02-08,SpeakEV,just got a brand new 500e passion model and i have the app and can turn lights on switch climate on etc should it also show tyre pressures currently battery levels etc like it does on the advert any help would be greatly appreciated as i am pulling my hair out and the dealership are about as much use
2022-12-02,SpeakEV,hi i normally drive a zoe but its going off the road today possibly for some time for a repair ive been offered a fiat 500e as a replacement its possibly the 42kwh version but i dont know if other sizes are available the garage quoted a 160 mile range but the fiat website says up to 199 im just wondering if theres any gotchas about having a different car temporarily eg 1 my wife does a 100 mile round trip commute at 6070mph will the car need charged to get back home at this time of yea our zoe uses around 40kwh to make that journey 2 does the fiat have standard type 2 home charging we have a zappi at home 3 is the fiat ccs for fast charging anything else we should watch out for
2022-01-23,SpeakEV,hi all im a first time car owner and got myself the fiat 500e i really love it but everything being so tight in london and me not being the best at parking i scratched badly my wheel today you can imagine how gutted i was for my brand new car so i wanted to ask do you normally fix yours as soon as damaged shall i take it where i bought it from to fix or just find someone locally to repair is there any type of protection i can add to avoid dents and scratches thanks
2021-04-24,SpeakEV,after being interested in the 500e for quite a while i was finally able to have a test drive last week at my local fiat garage looks like i was the first to try it as it only had 8 miles on the clock in general the car is a real quantum leap over the old 500 i always loved the look of the old 500 and actually bought one in 2009 however i sold it soon after as it was pretty crap to drive this new electric model improves on the old car in pretty much every conceivable way positives looks great in the metal finally a good driving position in a 500 lots of adjustment in the seat and steering wheel you can sit noticeably lower compared to the old 500 the central display in the la prima i drove was responsive and crisp wireless carplay worked faultlessly radar cruise and auto lane hold worked very well performance felt decent nippy away from the lights amazing turning circle i didnt have time to fully test the efficiency but it seemed pretty good range was stated at 160 miles at 100 when i first got in i drove for 13 miles at a stated 4 mikwh on a mixture of motorway and town driving and got back with 7 used and 147 miles left on the gom negatives although the interior looks great there are a few bits where the materials feel cheap the ride was generally good but it tended to thump over serious bumps nowhere near as bad as the old 500 though overall i really liked it its a pity i couldnt keep it for longer to really see what the efficiency is like and what its like to live with id also be interested to see what deals are available at the right price it could be a really compelling package

2020-11-21,SpeakEV,noticed that quite a few initial reviews of the new electric fiat 500 are now on youtube from the german reviewers the most interesting one that i came across is linked below links jumps to charging section however due to its length the auto generated closed captions arent available key take aways from the linked video at the 150kw charger car plugged in at 7 initial charge rate of 82kw 26 minutes to 81 at 81 charge rate of 425kw with 277 kwh delivered in that time 4243kw until 85 seems as though it is a staircase shaped charge curve at 85 charge rate drops to 13kw around 29 minutes from 7 to 85 294 kwh delivered in that time another german review of the car with autogenerated closed captions available
2022-08-16,SpeakEV,hi can anyone advise please my wife loves the 500 weve had 3 and now are thinking to go electric test driven 2 at 2 showrooms the only thing thats stopping us ordering is a possible issue with the brakes on both demonstrater cars when at really low speed as if in traffic and creeping forward the brakes make a horrendous squeaking sound it happened on both demo cars the sales guys both said it had never been heard before and fiat have no reported issues with this problem but when i researched it online there were a few review websites who mentioned this issue a while back the main one being a carwow review by mat watson can anyone who had bought a new 500e in the last 6 months please confirm or deny if theyve had any such noise on their electric 500e its the only thing thats stopping us ordering one but if those demo cards were mine and i sat in traffic day after day with that squeaking every time i would go mad thanks for any help
2024-03-07,SpeakEV,i now have low rate electricity overnight 1 i tried to set up a charging schedule on the fiat app and have zappi on fast result immediate charge 2 i tried to delete all settings in fiat app and set up zappi as the scheduled charging result exactly the same 3 i now get up and manually put the charger on we have intelligent octopus my husbands car is the designated car volvo xc40 with its own charger so i am just using it as a piece of the home equipment any advice please
2023-08-22,SpeakEV,charging places in lewis harris plus the recent charging situation for the isle of skye part of my 143 day ev photo tour with the fiat 500e was to the isle of lewis and harris ive summarised my experience and advice on ev charging in the outer hebrides plus a quick recap of the situation in skye if you want to watch the video of this part of the tour you can do this here or you can read the blog photo guide for lewis and harris outer hebrides scotland both lewis and harris part of the outer hebrides make a great road trip for your ev and are particularly fascinating to see through a camera lens if you want to find the best photo spots on lewis and harris look no further ive listed them all for you from sea stacks to historical sites wwwjoanaimagescom with photos of chargers etc charging your electric vehicle is not always easy in the outer hebrides there are only two rapid charging stations in lewis and harris 50kw one in lewis stornoway and one in harris tarbert at stornoway we faced hourlong queues especially when a ferry arrived we have often decided that it makes more sense to charge on a slower 22kw charger but use the charging time to eat or do something else in tarbert it was a bit easier when we were on the island july 2023 charging was still free but we were already seeing a new charging point that was about to go live and once thats online it wont be free anymore there are a few 22kw chargers across the island if you drive a lot i would recommend planning your charging stops accordingly some are located next to the village cafe and i think its only fair to contribute to the community by enjoying a cup of coffee or tea or even by having lunch there while charging for example we did that at the uig community center which is great when you want to go to the mangersta stacks and in breaclete which is very convenient to visit great bernera with your electric vehicle if you want to see north lewis there is a charging station near eoropie beach which is great for visiting the beach but also butt of lewis port stoth etc however nothing to do at this charging station it is located on school grounds albeit open to the public so waiting for the car to charge at 22kw is no fun luckily our fiat 500e only takes 2 to 25 hours on the fastest charge setting from empty to 100 and we usually stop when its at 40 and we know we wont have a rapid charger in 1 to 15 hours were done with a full charge and usually combine this with a packed lunch picnic tables are all over the island but i know some cars dont pick up the juice that quickly and ive heard of some zoe drivers taking two hours to charge 20 at those charge points that sucks in harris there is a 22 kw charger down south in leverburgh next to the ferry terminal but to be fair the distances in harris are so short and sooner or later you will be back in tarbert with two 22kw chargers and one rapid charger which will suffice one piece of urgent advice check the chargeplacescotland app regularly to make sure the charging point you are trying to charge to is working they seem to go out of service on a regular basis and its no fun being stuck in a remote location with no ejuice and no alternative charging point dont forget your cps rfid card the old charging stations dont accept charging via app if you have mobile phone reception anyway another tip if you are catching the ferry from tabert to uig on the isle of skye on the way back make sure you fully charge your car in tabert the charging situation in skye is dire when we were there there was none rapid charger at all and only one 22kw charger with one socket in portree the nearest charging points are all near the skye bridge as you exit the island all other ev chargers are out of order and we have met some ev drivers who have cancelled their stay in skye and turned around due to the poor charging situation skye got a really bad reputation for that and while people usually love skye mass tourism inflated prices and the lack of working charging points seem to be changing that at the moment it almost seems like a method of trying to get rid of ev drivers is this a way to reduce overtourism so charge to 100 in tarbert or you wont be able to drive through skye to get home

2023-12-07,SpeakEV,hi all i have had my nissan leaf since 2016 type 1 charger from new and had a pod point installed at home when i got the car im getting a fiat 500e in a couple of weeks which obviously is type 2 ive been in touch with pod point who have told me the tethered cable at home cant be swapped over due to new regulations and i need a whole new unit with a data cable the installation is not straightforward but can be done as i already have a pod point a few questions is it illegal to still have a very old pod point about 7 and half years old which doesnt have the data cable im not bothered about viewing it all on my phone can i just buy a type 1 to type 2 adapter and put this on the end of my tethered pod point cable at home will this be detrimental to my new car in anyway im probably going to have to pay anything up to 1500 because the installation isnt straight forward not sure whether its just best to get a whole new unit installed with the data cable or stick with what ive got and buy an adapter this would save a lot of money any advice welcome thanks
2023-12-25,SpeakEV,i had a 2016 nissan leaf for nearly 8 years and have just part exchanged it for a fiat 500e i really like the car but there has been one issue after another i know the issues are all things that can be rectified but im just not sure if i should get something else the dealer has agreed i can reject the car because it is within 14 days can you recommend a small ev preferably 3 door smaller than the old style leaf with a decent range when i got my leaf there were only a handful of evs now there is so much choice im confused thanks
2022-02-16,SpeakEV,hi there my wife bought a fiat 500e last june and i have to say it is a fantastic car however one question i have is fiat claims the cars wltp range is good for 199 miles but when fully charged the dash says the range is 161 miles is there some sort of safety margin here this has been like this for some time so when the weather was warmer i wonder if any of you can shed some light on this cheers austin
2022-06-06,SpeakEV,hello first time poster and ev owner here my better half has just gotten her license auto only and decided to opt for the fiat 500e 24kw we currently rent our home and may be looking to move in the next year or so ideally wed like a home charging solution since the range on the 24kw 500e isnt the greatest and i dont want to be sat in our local station car park every day having a gander online i can see things like podpoints are around 700 but with the 350 grant this will obviously work out cheaper however im reluctant to pay for a charger that ill own and add value to a house thats not mine only to move in 8 months time and have to fork out for a new charger again this time without the grant since itll have been used so i know that egg isnt the cheapest solution as its 30 a month not including the exorbitant cost of electricity at the moment and i understand owning our charger would be a cheaper option long term but given our current circumstances described above does this seem like a decent short term option or is there something better i should be looking at apologies if this is a noob question this is our first foray into evs and so id rather ask people with knowledge than try to figure it all out on my own with no idea what im doing  goose
2024-03-28,SpeakEV,short version are there any evs coming soon with reasonable range and affordable insurance long version contemplating the future of my e208 i had a shock when i checked how much it would cost to insure a new driver using a comparison website figures below for newly qualified driver in middle of suburbia nowhere special clean license 8000 miles driving per year unlike most of my previous small cars i wont be selling it or donating it to someone looking for a cheap first car agecheapest quotesecond cheapest quote173500725021280030002521002200 ps i know these figures can be reduced a bit by various hacks such as having an older named driver on the policy but the 208 is insurance group 26 figures for the seat mii insurance group 12 are more reasonable and its got a useable range unfortunately vw group are no longer making these small evs so will soon become rare and the lowest insurance group i could find for a new car with a reasonable range was group 17 for a fiat 500e 42kwh nice looking car but insurance might still be too pricey i suspect my questions are 1 are there any new cars coming soon with a reasonable range eg 100 miles winter range and reasonable insurance eg group 10ish or below 2 not completely serious but intended to promote discussion if someone invented a stellantis sport mode disabler could we get the e208corsae etc more sensible insurance quotes for its natural second and third hand market
2022-08-22,SpeakEV,moien im änder from luxembourg aged 44 and last week i ordered a fiat 500e cabrio after having felt to get an electric car for a certain time now the fiat will be my main car replacing my 2015 renault mégane coupécabriolet with a diesel engine and more than 100k km on the counter i like to go on hikes in my country especially the autopédestres their name comes from driving with a car to the starting point and then walking marked circuits there are about 200 of those in my tiny country seeing whole forest parcels dying these last years i thought i better switch from burning oil products to electric power which can be produced in a much cleaner way after all i hope ill find the answers im looking for here and maybe make some interesting contacts

2021-09-21,SpeakEV,i asked on another thread about what you get in the car looking at the website you get a wall box that is essentially a neater way to use a 3 pin plug not bad but not ideal as our dumb rolec charger is nearly 6 years old im thinking of upgrading however there isnt any costs cited and dealership doesnt have details has anyone enquired i know 6 years ago my install cost me 249 after the grant i assume itll be far more today also my concern is whilst smart is neat dumb also means the energy providers cant tax use which im assuming will be enviable as its invisible to them so reluctant to give the rolec up thoughts

2021-11-27,SpeakEV,dort had 500e 3 months now and energy in is working out at 312 kwhmile but costs low combined with a few free podpoints and overnight tariff works out at 18pmile so overall pcp and running costs favour ev over a new petrol fiat 500 basically if you spend over 100month on petrol and range is enough 160 miles then 500e should be 1st choice for fiat fans anyone else keep stats

2022-05-22,SpeakEV,hi guys im new to the forum and to evs i just landed in france and hired a fiat 500e it had 78 when i collected it and headed of where i was travelling to needed more miles than i had left so at 35 remaining i stopped at a service station after trial and error i got the charger to work i put my card in and 4999 was debited for my 4999 i got approx another 25 as it went up to 60 full this seems like and awful lot of money and much more that the cost of petrol or diesel is this what ev recharges usually costs thx in advance
2022-06-28,SpeakEV,one of the recurring feedback themes i hear from ice owners considering the move to an ev is the purchasefinance cost for owners of old petroldiesels that do high mileage there is definitely a benefit in switching and leasing costs running costs of a new ev can be less overall eg for someone that dives in excess of 10k miles per year there are a few smaller evs vw eup nissan leaf fiat 500e renault zoe mg5 that can be leased for around the 250pcm mark but deposits required are still hefty 1k2k but many people buy older used cars often for a few thousand few hundred pounds what brand out there could segway into a cheap popular ev easyjet megabusbev aldi given the huge interest and limited supply of electric cars it will be many many years before we get to address this used ev affordability issue maybe decades
2022-04-23,SpeakEV,hi all so i have a kona and love it the other half loves driving the kona because of the electric but doesnt want one as its to big we were considering a zoe she has a mazda 2 at the moment but really like the style and quirkyness of the fiat 500e itll be a 2nd car so its not doing long journeys but whats the backseats like for kids youtube reviews seem a bit mixed with some people saying its fine and others not we have a 5 year old in a high back booster and a 12 year old but realistically 90 of the time the 12 year old would be in the passenger seat and just the 5 year old in the back there might be the rare occasion where one of them has a friend in the car as well but thats a really specific circumstance not the norm if it was all 4 of us wed be using my kona but for when the other half is doing school runs and the odd trip to town etc whats peoples thoughts on the 500e anyone here have kids and use the back seats how do they find it i do totally understand the zoe is going to be more practical but the 500e is a characterful little car thanks

2017-09-11,SpeakEV,hello all i am the very happy owner of a zippy fiat 500e my first ev wonderful to commute and drop the kids off at school 5 min away i settled on keeping my good old and reliable ice dodge minivan to pull our motorcycle trailer for week end outings it really is oversized for this usage and i was thinking of replacing it with a rav4 ev with a hitch but range and range reduction with the additional constraint of the relatively light trailer with 3 dirt bikes on it i would be lucky to get a total of 60 real miles guestimate total for the full equipage which really puts us right under what is needed to go to the nearest track and back but pulling a trailer means that i can add things onto it like extra batteries for the rav4 ev and may be get to a point where even with the extra weight i could extend the range sufficienty for our escapades before getting into efficient frontier calculations i wil need to research the data first i wonder if anyone here has experience with adding extra batteries to their ev looking forward to learning thank you e

2014-09-07,SpeakEV,having driven the egolf for a short while recently dont ask i was mightily impressed it felt like a nippy golf without the noise was lovely having gazed longingly from afar at the fiat 500e having been bewitched by my time driving the mini e all those years ago having spent far too many hours of my life sprinting down country lanes and nipping across roundabouts i have to wonder wheres our hot hatch battery electric vehicle surely this couldshouldwould be one of the key icebreakers in terms of ev adoption get people in a smallish ev with good performance and decent range but most importantly compact and quick and im sure youll win ever more hearts and minds am i mad in thinking this is a market that could really really benefit from bevs i mean they already claim them as city cars the hot hatch is only one step beyond that surely

2024-02-02,SpeakEV,hi i already have an 2021 audi etron and a 2022 chevy bolt euv that the kid is driving and im looking for a third cheap used ev as a spare car i initially made a large list that included the i3 soul ev leaf fiat but after driving them all ive narrowed it down to a 2017 mercedes b250e and because i like the bolt euv so much a 20172018 bolt ev premier both have pros and cons i dont care that the merc only has an 87mile range as it will only be used for errands around town so the extra range of the bolt is not meaningful to me obviously the interior and the ride quality of the merc is way better than the bolt but the merc will be more difficult and costly to repair as time goes on due to the fact that it was a limited specialty vehicle i dont even think that all mercedesbenz dealers can service a b250e even here in southern california the bolt would be much easier to maintain and i actually like the exterior look of the bolts more than the boring mercedes the merc has better tech than the bolt lastly mercedes can be had for a few thousand dollars less than the bolt evhere in socal used ev prices are still inflated tiaall thoughts welcome

2022-01-30,SpeakEV,hi question is as per the subject which of the popular evs at the moment has what they call one pedal driving from what i gather this means that you can set the regenerative braking to such a level that the car will completely stop on its own if you are driving smoothly and anticipating the stopping distances correctly also does this mean the brake lights come on automatically when you have this enabled as soon as you take your foot off the accelerator
2022-01-03,SpeakEV,javert1969 said i would like cars like the kona in the list perhaps with a next to them and a comment indicating you have to use a hand control to completely stop the car  ive had a pretty good look and the list that dont have one pedal but can stop using the paddle is kona eniro that is all so we now have leaf i3 mini electric ix3 ix i4 tesla ioniq 5 ev6 chevrolet bolt not sold in uk kona eniro require paddle for complete stop

2018-12-27,SpeakEV,ive been a diesel driver for years but have hankered after an ev for a few years doing my research a family member might want to buy my low mileage 2015 dacia duster diesel car so im seriously pondering what to get now whilst i love my gadgets i also dig functionality over style so what some might see as an ugly duckling is not necessarily ruled out if i kept the diesel as a second vehicle ive been seriously tempted by the twizy as a fun run around but if im selling the diesel ill need a far more capable vehicle my only issue is my driveway is barely the length of a car theres no gate and its a busy main road southamptons very own piccadilly circus where school children walk past every day this means any car parked on the driveway needs to be reversed on as reversing out into a busy road is a nogo this also means any electric car cannot have a charge port on the nose as the darling little feral pint sized crotch goblins will snap the plug and charge flap whilst walking by the moment i turn my back so im needing a short list of evs which have side accessed charging ports budget 1530k ish not that interested in pcp or finance unless i can get a discount then pay it off in full soon after as i usually own a vehicle until it becomes a liability to keep repaired new or nearly new ex demo etc the ones i can think of right now are peugeot e208 peugeot e2008 vauxhall corsa e vauxhall mokka e citroen ec4 citroen berlingo electric mini electric bit small but it is cute bmw i3 do like the styling but worried bmw aftersales will be costly and painful vw id3 do i really want to be a software beta tester for what might be windows me on wheels vw eup and the vag siblings bit small only 3kw charging on ac i seem to recall skoda enyaq smart fortwo forfour excluded as they dont do dc rapid charge tesla even 2nd hand sub 30k are off my shortlist as i cant be doing with a company who are so anti righttorepair and have questionable build quality so what cars have i missed if any
2021-12-09,SpeakEV,sean1001 said no problem a charge to feature would be nice but i guess the e208corsae is at the affordable end of the market  and yet stellantis do provide just such a feature on the fiat 500e app you can charge to a set percentage or stop at a set time both things i too want on the mokka
2022-03-25,SpeakEV,this is a consumer led forum not an engineering one how many vauxhall citroen fiat drivers are even aware of the corporate governance of the owning company why should they care in my view most people will be looking for the brand and car and thats how it should be organised it would be useful to then have a pinned discussion or information note that the following cars are similar and you may find useful information here too
2022-01-03,SpeakEV,another strong year for ice especially ford given that the cheapest ev the vauxhall corsae is more expensive than a volkswagen polo we desperately need affordable ev models which the automakers simply refuse to offer
2023-02-07,SpeakEV,after the article the other week on toyota whining about the zev requirement in new car sales it seems a few others like me thought it was whining from a company that had backed the wrong horse and not done enough on pure bevzev vehicles here they are saying theyre going to be fine but a few years in the future so jam tomorrow toyota predicts 620mile range for evs by 2027 after battery breakthrough car dealer magazine toyota says evs should be capable of driving for up to 620 miles on one charge in just a few years and theyll be cheaper too thats thanks to a cardealermagazinecouk anyone want to bet against my prediction that come the end of next year and the massive fines theyll be getting asked to pay for not selling enough evs theyll be trying to claim that they shouldnt have to pay as this is in development its like the late 1980s and cold fusion

2020-02-18,SpeakEV,i have a launch edition and was well and truly p155ed off when the car eventually arrived because we simply didnt know what it would fittedremoved from the car that toured uk dealers but when the first car came to my dealer 1 short test drive convinced me i hadnt made a mistake the price is high but then id come from a 60k car however owning it for 6 months i have to say its brilliant yes the lights could have more tech but it drives and hadles superbly the infotaintment and apps work something that my two previous evs had issues with my dealer seems to have a couple on site tesla have definitely thrown a spanner in the works and i wouldnt hesitate to consider the volvo ex30 dual motor which is slightly more expensive but the stumbling block would be my wife she doesnt like volvos do i really need 062 in 36 seconds maybe maybe not its not my problem its renaults and the dealers unless potential customers get in and drive these cars they wont realise how good they are

2014-12-12,SpeakEV,kenb said if you live in the midlands and have a 200ml range car you can go anywhere in england perhaps not cornwall without on route charging just destination  this is very much in the line of thinking of the evangelists if you commute less than 50 miles every day and have a driveway and dont go very far on your holidays then a bev is perfect for you therefore bevs are a good solution for everyone do you see why i will rephrase what you just wrote to make it clear you said effectively everyone should live in the midlands and have a bev with more than 200 mile range in winter then there are no issues on range if i might just point out that not everyone lives in the midlands and actually very few have a 200 mile winter motorway range bev so really your comment is not very useful
2020-09-27,SpeakEV,in a disappointing move that could result in billions of euros in health and environmental costs the european union today caved to pressure from the automobile industry to rethink its landmark rules setting strict limits for toxic emissions from cars and trucks as legacy automakers lose ground in the transition to evs they are urging governments to kill off clean air laws i guess that the value of bev will go down even more now at the moment the prices offered for second hand bev on wbac and other platforms are just a joke legacy automakers fall behind on evs and urge to slash clean air laws rather than try to catch up the eu today caved to pressure from automakers to rethink landmark rules setting limits for toxic emissions from cars electrekco

2018-07-16,SpeakEV,gary333 said they dont show the date the pictures were taken but to be fair wed never get a straight answer from any dealer about this so i could have been full empty or someone in between suppose its the risk of buying rather than leasing the blue one has pictures at 11 so theyre not a very observant dealer  yes as you say you probably cant find out but equally it might not matter maybe the blue one wasnt as charged 80 vs 100 for the white which would make 11 and 31 the same who knows im not buying one anyway just thought some people who were looking at the base model 51kw might be interested in a discounted 64kw its still got 75 years battery warranty

2016-03-22,SpeakEV,stinsy said still the only bev convertible i believe  unless you consider the fiat 500e c i would expect that it would be in the same segment for the target audience looking for a small design based convertible but the cost difference and real life range is huge you can pick up a brand new 500e c for about 29k and most people will easily get 160 miles of range from it whilst you will struggle to get more than 110 miles from the mini e convertible the price of that mini is eye watering
2019-01-10,SpeakEV,gavj said yes somethings have gone up more than inflation but many things have gone down the big things like housing average house price in 2010 178k and now 264k spot on with inflation ford fiesta titanium in 2010 15k and 22k when it was discontinued again spot on with boe inflation other items 2010 samsung 40 fhd tv 699 today 219 most electronics have reduced in price like for like and are generally better spec and lower power consumption but people want a 65 oled tv lifestyle creep other things that people buy without thinking you werent popping via the costa drivethru in 2010 because the first one didnt arrive until 2011 part of lifestyle creep but there are definitely things that consistently outpace inflation like council tax which you cant do anything about people want better things i get that but many people feel worse off now because they arent looking like for like  you are missing the tax burden increasing which squeezes real take home pay and then there also student loans adding a significant cost for many who effectively pay a higher rate of tax than the rest of us and again the threshold is frozen so even if they get inflation level pay rises they take home less in real terms the big issue now is housing costs which have escalated significantly for those who cannot afford to buy as well as mortgage costs you have a number for housing there but the data we see most often shows the multiple of earnings required to buy and its got a lot higher thats caused a rental crisis for many
2023-04-28,SpeakEV,i know its not the first time but what do you think about this and any ideas for a solution httpsamptheguardiancombusinessarticle2024jun25vauxhallownercarplantsshutukstellantisellesmereportluton ive got to admit i have a lot of sympathy for them they have spent a lot of money committing to electrification and the uk government keeps moving the goal posts around now they are going to be fined for not hitting sales quotas that are probably impossible to meet net zero and ev adoption seems to have become a polarised political issue and instead of worrying about what state we leave the world in for future generations read the reform flyer that comes through your letter box its much better to blame high energy prices on new technologies in response to abject nonsense from our highly informed press and social media outlets given the onslaught of nonsense i dont know what the solution is as anything will be made out as an attack on normal folk i dont think it should a stick and im not sure about state sponsored tax dodging either but the incoming changes to ulez seem bonkers to me as does making ved the same as for petrol and diesel we have a green strip on our number plates give them some perks like access to bus lanes and free council parking maybe apply some sort of cap to fast charging prices run some public information campaigns about evs post some ideas mine might be stupid but perhaps there might be some good ones that an mp might see and something happen rather than car manufacturers needing to be propped up with tax money to stay
2022-03-19,SpeakEV,gavj said but oddly the previous revision of the engine was voted engine of the year for 4 years in a row in the under 10l category personally love the engine i own one so biased absolutely bomb proof you can bounce it off the rev limiter all day long its also super efficient its doing well at over 196k miles considering its virtually undriveable but its not really surprising you didnt like it considering you drive a massive car with 400hp more than this that costs 85k i once tried caviar it was bloody horrible  caviar is revolting its just fishy salt venison is awful too tastes like rotting meat

2016-03-22,SpeakEV,i also love the look of the honda e and the tech i think it is worth remembering the landscape when it launched i was meeting with honda uk at the time and there was very little in the city car category with a lot more range they had a very clear target audience of middle to high income drivers in cities particularly london where it would be seen as a stylish accessory as a 2nd vehicle the kind of people who drive maybe 6080 miles a week one of the challenges is that there is so much more choice now mini ora cat and 500e are obvious choices and they can all go further for the odd journey if you wish we are thinking about having a fun small ev for mainly city use and i would really like a honda e but we had a 500e for two weeks in the coldest week in the winter and still managed to get over 120 miles on the motorway whilst it is rare we would want to do that the peace of mind which comes with it is valuable
2022-08-25,SpeakEV,i recently saw this car at the brussels motor show and was rather impressed by it it appears to be solidly built though i am not sure if it qualifies as a car or is just an electric quadricycle and has the range and features i need for most of my commutes has anyone here have any first hand experience with this car the specific points i want to verify that are not easily established during a test drive a how good is the heating defrosting in cold weather b they claim a top speed of 85kmph and a range of 150km what can one expect to get in real world conditions c does it feel reliable road grip etc snowice

2019-03-18,SpeakEV,philev said the problem in the uk is they arent value for money at 38k at least 10k overpriced and not enough customers with the spare cash to throw at something nice if the started with a 2xk then it would have sold like hot cakes thats before all the energy crisis and interest hikes wrecking peoples disposal income same happened to the ora funky cat but they got greedy and caught out on pricing days before the gov grant was pulled and stuck with trying to sell a car at 32k which was originally meant to be 22k didnt help the word got out they sold virtually the same car in china at 14k equivalent and asking 18k more to uk audiences  i had a pre order at 28k for the advance but didnt take it up as the pandemic had just started and with brexit i wasnt sure what was happening work wise it was a bit over priced even at 28k but quite special so could be justified i could have had it for 4 years for about 10k in depreciation not that that would be the main concern it was a halo car loads of technology and a way for honda to get experience with evs i dont think they planned to sell huge numbers of them

2016-01-03,SpeakEV,morning all new e208 owner joining the discussion for the last few years weve adopted a x1 ice and x1 bev vehicle strategy we now use the ice vw campervan for longer trips weekends away etc and the bev tesla model 3 initially then most recently a model y for most day to day and local driving which accounts for 80 of our driving we did use the tesla for longer journeys south wales to scotland or france as examples but more recently have found charging wait times and subsequent longer journey times to be a regular annoyance hence why we default for now to the ice for longer trips that should be better in a few years when the charging infrastructure has caught up we concluded last week that as a result we didnt need a tesla to cover mostly local day to day driving for the next few years so on something of an impulse we decided to swap it for a smaller less expensive bev with lower range the e208 won picked one up a few days ago 24k for a e208 gt in elixir red registered jan 2023 and with only 300 miles on the clock so basically a new car for a considerable discount off list further research tells me this is one of those 2022 models range 225 miles being cleared before the arrival of the refreshed version with slightly more powerrange suits us perfectly though first impressions are very positive indeed things i like more than the tesla experience the e208 looks lovely nicely designed inside and out the drive in the e208 is more refined much better suspension and quieter more comfortable seats apple carplay is available digital cockpit good to have dials in front of me again some buttons for simple controls auto wipers work door handles inside and out that i dont have to explain to people how they work a glovebox i can open without navigating a touchscreen ok the glovebox is tiny being back in a small hatchback is nice much more town and car park friendly insurance is less than half the price of insuring the tesla a few things that the tesla wins on range obviously it was a model y long range that could comfortably do 250 miles ability to set a maximum state of charge i used to set the tesla at 80 max when charging overnight quite surprised i cant do that on the peugeot speed even the lr has ridiculous acceleration im no boy racer though so can take it or leave it app just worked less steps to get it connected to the car and just leave it mobile as car key also good heated seats didnt get them on the e208 i gather they are an additional option dog mode in the tesla was regularly used storage space model y is obviously much bigger but the e208 boot is big enough for our spaniel so fine frunk to carry charging cables overall very happy with the change always had a liking for little french hatchbacks and the e208 seems a very good example of exactly that it really is good to drive and pretty quick too

2022-02-18,SpeakEV,this relates to an onto supplied e208 allure premium had the car nearly one week and have done 1000 miles in that time odo now just over 3000 miles car registered 30th april 2022 driving long distance yesterday the screen became unresponsive and refused to allow any heating despite several stops including charging where the car was switched off locked the fault remained meaning i arrived home cold there must be a reset somewhere but im not familiar of such the android auto works one day one journey not the next its totally unpredictable dropping my connection my google maps mid motorway when needed due to traffic jams requiring a new route never had a problem connecting with any other car there are many things that irritate me about this car having toggle switches that are not backlit yet everything else is beyond a joke at night especially in heavy rain no auto hold seems a big miss having to rely on an app to charge during cheap rate hours at home a start time but no finish time why not a simple interface built into the infotainment system its a lovely car to drive but i have no faith in the infotainment system its pants imho anyone have any suggestions regarding resetting the system many thanks
2016-09-03,SpeakEV,i5 now almost 2 years old due sep 1st and 28815 miles covered had a day trip to bicester heritage in oxford yesterday for the pistonheads 25th anniversary get together 200 mile round trip a lot of stunning cars on show had a quick rapid charge on ionity just before getting back home and now today just plugged in my zappi for a trickle charge and got a notification on my apple watch and iphone after about a minute to say cannot start charging unexpected vehicle status went to check on car zappi light was blue and not red indicating a fault unplugged and plugged in again seems to start charging but then car clicks off again after about 5 seconds with same notification issue with zappi had just been charging my wifes e208 without issue so tried the hyundai 3 pin granny cable and exactly the same thing again car clicks off and stops charging after a few seconds although looking at dash no charge being taken on dont get the usual display of kw under the battery before it stops trying to charge when car in ready mode dash display shows check electric vehicle system with an orange warning lighttriangle when it clicks off everything else in car still works as normal including the power seats and no other warning lights so does not look like a 12v battery issue took car for a quick spin around the block no problems no warning lights came home plugged in but same problem on plugging in again been a brilliant car up to now and loving it but unable to charge is going to be a major issue will call hyundai in the morning looking at these forums this could well be the iccu failure apparently afflicting many hyundaikia and genesis cars at similar ages also

2017-02-13,SpeakEV,hi all i was thinking about the use of heat pumps in evs yesterday and something occurred to me a heat pump is a great idea for reducing energy consumption of the heater a cop coefficient of performance of 3 to 4 is typical for a heat pump at least when the outside temperature is above about 10c this means you get about 3 to 4 times the heat output compared to electrical input so a resistance heater like the one in my ion which is 5kw when going flat out uses 5kw of energy a heat pump could produce 5kw of heat from as little as 1250 1600 watts which is a major win of course there are drawbacks too a resistance heater is simple and bullet proof while a heat pump is just an ac system going in reverse so has all the same failure mechanisms such as failing compressor gas leaks potential damage to the evapcondensor from road debris etc also below about 10c they get less and less effective and may need the assistance of a resistance heater at very low canadian winter temperatures although probably not a big issue here in the uk these tradeoffs are well known but another one occurred to me how do you defog the windscreen effectively in really wethumid conditions around 512 degrees if you cant run both the heater and ac at the same time in a conventional ice or an ev with a resistance heater you can run both heater and ac at the same time the air first passes through the ac and is cooled removing moisture and then passes through the heater to be warmed up again resulting in warm dry air that will remove even the worst fog like a magic wand although it saps the battery badly i sometimes find myself forced to run the ac and heater together on low in my ion to keep the windows clear of fog and of course its second nature to do this in my ice where the heater is free and ac has little effect on range but if you have a heat pump system in your ev do you just have a single dual purpose evaporatorcondenser behind the dashboard that switches roles by reversing the pump depending on whether you want heating or cooling in which case it is impossible to both cool to remove moisture the airflow and then heat it up again at the same time or is there an ancillary resistance heater that you can turn on at the same time that the heat pump is in ac mode but at great energy expense im interested to know how you find defogging your windows if you have a car with a heat pump system and whether there is indeed a range sapping ancillary resistance heater that needs to be put into action to both cool and heat at the same time or whether you just find it more difficult to defog your windows in wet humid conditions
2023-01-14,SpeakEV,slim_shady said that is why they are expensive if uk gov dished out a grant to buy a used ev prices would rise  paul_moxhay said regardless of how boyant people say the used ev market is i am really surprised at how few people are switching to a used ev from ice given the prices i would have thought there would be a stampede to buy up used evs especially given how cheap they are to run is charging at home  many 2nd hand car drivers dont drive enough miles a year to truely justify the cost of installing a home charger in property they may move from in a few years time this should be a target for government action monkeyhanger said that says to me that the appetite for private ownership of bevs atnew car pricing is very low and the crazy low 2 bik rate is the main driver for bev sales  why buy a new car when you can get the same car for half the price ex lease now it is easy to buy 2nd hand automatics there a few good reasons for a private buyer to buy any new car icdp_ev said you are also bringing up prices of 24kw leafs an utterly useless car for the vast majority of peoples needs not to mention the they are about 2000 more expensive than an equivalent ice are you seriously trying to tell me an 8 year old leaf with 60k miles on the clock and a 24kw battery with 60 miles of winter range is a better option than a similar aged ford focus that costs 2000 less  think of old people who didnt drive many miles have a nice finale salary pension and would love the car to automatically defrost itself the preheatingdefrost with evs should be promoted more

2021-12-02,SpeakEV,padrino said i dont really know about stellantis but tesla lfp battery are recommended to be charged to 100 at least once a week tesla going even further saying that you should plug the battery the car every night and leave it to fully charge considering the fact that almost all manufacturers get some or all of the batteries from catl i guess that the battery is almost the same the difference here comes with different bms used by different car makers the same as the petrol coming out of grangemouththe base is the same just the additive are a wee bit different  the simplest way for a bms to balance the cells is simply to bleed off energy from the highest cells through a resistor at high soc this is how most bev bmss work the main problem is that they typically balance very very slowly as in tens or hundreds of ma this is why leaf packs become unbalanced despite the bms best efforts i guess lfp packs have extremely slow balancing so need to be left at high soc so that the balancers can do their job more sophisticated fullyactive balancing technologies exist but i know of no bev that uses them mercedes bevs have an additional balancer at the bottom end which adds energy to the lowest cells not sure how others do it they keep their cards close to their chest

2011-12-07,SpeakEV,i often dont have a lot of time i dip in and out at regular intervals in the day and so for me it isnt that i dont want to read it it is more that if i do i then dont have much time to read anything else anyway read it now good post i moved to cornwall in 2006 from harlow essex and since then i have noticed that cars are in general much older here there is money here more so since covid a lot of people moved here after but i do feel that in deepest cornwall redruth camborne etc money is tight and there are very few evs owned by natives so with that in mind installing ev chargers could be seen as spending money for the holidaymakers and not for the locals and to an extent id agree with that yes eventually the less welloff places will catch up regarding ev ownership but i suspect that cornwall will be one of the last places to do so in the uk
2022-01-17,SpeakEV,dumfriesdik said as a noob i am aware that charge curves chargers and bevs are in a world of dark art and are intrinsically linked having charged on a public charger just a couple of times we did get over 55kw for a bit is it possible for a 50kw charger to deliver 50kw to cars with a higher recharge ability ie 120kw and how likely will that happen  no a 50kw charger will be limited to approximately 50kw driving an id3 all you really need to remember is that to get the best charge speed you need to arrive at the charging station with low soc as low as you are comfortable aiming for and outside of mid summer you need to have been driving for a while at a decent speed to build up some heat in the battery a couple of hours at 70 is usually enough for me the algorithm that determines allowable charge speed seems to be quite complicated though there is no point using a single curve to try to predict what you should expect the absolute maximum possible is about 135kw after which it will retain above 100kw to 2930 gradually dropping but if you plug in at say 25 you will never see more than 8090kw of course this is often absolutely fine if you are getting a coffee etc if you see a charger advertised as 150kw in my experience you will get what the id3 can take as discussed above some are limited to 250a which would be about 105kw in an id3 but most arent and in an id3 thats pretty good anyway if you pick a 120kw charger though its highly likely to be limited to 200a which is about 8085kw in an id3 if you have arrived at very low soc hoping for 120kw that would be annoying

2022-11-04,SpeakEV,so i was part if the initial megane priority list customer ended up not buying the car as so many promised features were a no show ended up keeping my current car volvo xc60 and buying a second hand id3 for the wife which both of us use i must say i am enjoying more than i thought i would do the software despite being still in 24 is not that annoying to me and i do enjoy how the car rides and handles along with some small clever features i have adaptive cruise but no lane centering which is the only feature i wish it had my volvo has it i am not saying its perfect no car is anyway i am now thinking i should look at the megane again to see if theres been any update to the specification list and to my surprise the waiting list for a new one is only about 2 weeks with quite a few available for immediate delivery pretty much everything else at the moment has a waiting list of several months hence my question is it an own goal by renault uk for specifying a lesser car for the uk
2022-01-16,SpeakEV,ym7 said im close to purchasing a used corsae elite nav 20 reg in a few days and wanted to get some input from current owners the car im buying is around 15k for 8000 miles i was supposed to pick it up on the weekend when they found an issue with the onboard charger which i suspect is a recall theyre replacing this but mentioned there is a slight delay in receiving the part which led me to hop onto this forum and read some worrying things about electric corsas the car is left with 1 months warranty however the vauxhall dealer are providing with another year on top ive placed a refundable deposit to reserve the car is there anything i should be aware of since many people in this forum are talking about selling theirs after approx 3 years which makes me question the low prices on the used market any advice would be appreciated  i own an elite nav 2020 for 25 years now in the first year the wireling loom had to be replaced because the rear wiper wasnt working lol in the second year i kept getting multiple electric traction system fault errors which i could easily get rid of by turning the car off and on again unfortunately the last time i got this i had to get the car towed because the error prevented the car from going into drive mode the cause of this a faulty ac compressor which was not covered under warranty so i had to pay 15k euro this has been replaced and i havent had any issues with the car since its a really nice car if there are no issues

2019-12-01,SpeakEV,javert1969 said hi question is as per the subject which of the popular evs at the moment has what they call one pedal driving from what i gather this means that you can set the regenerative braking to such a level that the car will completely stop on its own if you are driving smoothly and anticipating the stopping distances correctly also does this mean the brake lights come on automatically when you have this enabled as soon as you take your foot off the accelerator  i thought all ev can do that at least on my old i3 there are no setting only 1 level of regen only way to adjust the regen is my right foot ie no cruising available as soon as i lift the pedal the car slow down and when the regen force pass certain point the brake light turn on it will come to complete stop if i time and judge correctly will not hold the car if the decline is too steep

2016-03-10,SpeakEV,due to the corsa really cheesing me off i decide to break the habit of a lifetime and actually test drive a car i was thinking of buying rather than just sitting in it and relying on james kate etc reviews i expected to be smitten i wasnt the looks are awesome the stereo is awesome the concept is awesome but the screens feel too close and the steering wheel doesnt pull out far at all seats are very firm they are well designed and supportive i was sat too high in the car as well the screen mirrors do work really well but if youre a certain age the drivers side one can be just in the area of vision that is in the needs reading glasses distance i did get used to it but it did make by eyes weird at times ride is also quite firm but it corners flat as anything power steering is clever and weights up at higher speeds but it does mean the car sometimes feels weird when you change direction road noise seems quite intrusive in a way i wasnt expecting its definitely louder inside than the corsa turning circle is fantastic stereo is so good i almost ignored all the other negatives steering wheel is also kind of sweaty compared to the cheaper feeling corsa one boot is very shallow which i didnt grasp i thought it was shallower horizontally but taller like the soul ev its very shallow in height but a bit longer in depth i did have the measurements but somehow they didnt translate to my brain range hmmm did 30 odd miles and it had about 60 battery or so which isnt any good as my usual trip is 55 and all year so it wasnt going to be quite up to it it was quite efficient at times and once youd been going for a bit and were bimbling along at 3040 it did go up quite a bit over all was 33 miles per kwh on the mixed run think the corsa would have actually done better with a tiny battery you have to be much more efficient it needed to have been kia efficient as id reckon one of those would have been about 4 45 miles per kwh doing the same one pedal mode is quite good but even on max death the regen feels weaker than i expected it was weaker feeling than the corsa which is quite weak the leaf had very strong regen in b mode and also with e pedal that was neck snapping in comparison other issue was with reversing onto a sloping driveway it didnt like it mine slopes down and it seems to upset quite a few cars the corsa i just stick in reverse and it creeps in reverse with the brake on happily i turned off the one pedal in the honda and it didnt seem to want to creep so you hit the gas it lurches off you hit the brake and its at a dead halt so you are making a right hash of a simple thing im glad a drove one as its been one of those cars i havent stopped obsessing over since they came out

2022-08-25,SpeakEV,i am close to making the decision to get my first electric car my review of the electric car market has lead me to conclude that the time is not yet ripe for me to replace my current car altogether there are very few ev entrants in the large family car with a big boot class that apart my current car is still going strong and i think it makes more environmental sense to use it for another year or two for journeys that actually need a big car use a small electric runabout for everything else most of what i do i find that the smart fortwo eq meets my needs yes the battery autonomy is limited and it probably is not too fast however given that my average car journey is under 10km in the countryside on small uncrowded roads however before i convince myself i thought i would ask here are there any gotchas i need to be aware of with this car is the car expensive to service is it safe to use in wet or icy weather does it tend to fog up on the inside when the weather is cold id be much obliged for any help and tips here

2022-05-05,SpeakEV,hi i have had my sync247 charger installed on my driveway at home and am very happy with it however i have stumbled across a problem regardiing the charge cable once the cable is in place and charging has commenced the cable is locked into the car and the wall once the charge is complete and the led flashes yellow to indicate so the tether unlocks from the wall if you remove the cable fromthe wall you can then remove ot from the car without your keys and with the car locked my charging is usaully complete at 2am therefore after 2am anyone can remove the cable and walk off with it without any problem these cables cost around 100 to replace and i doubt it will take long before the light fingered members of our society will work out that if a yellow flashing light is clearly displayed then the cable is there for the taking i have contacted sync ev247 regarding this issue and to date have not received a responce please tell me there is a setting that im missing to secure the cable post charge that will ensure the cable can not be removed so i can turn off my alarm setting for 2am and sleep through the night

2015-10-22,SpeakEV,my family are looking to go fully electric by replacing a yaris with a small ev to complement our tesla model s weve tried the fiat 500 e and mini electric but the current favourite is a 2021 zoe weve been over to the local renault dealer who have a few low mileage 2021s for sale so far weve had a quick spin in one of them to check the driveablility boot space seating setup etc but were going back for another test drive with a reserved car this weekend weve had the tesla since new 6 years so familiar with the ev experience have home charging living north of the border were also familiar with findingusing public rapids have a chargeplace scotland card so that side of things should be covered id be interested in any tipsthings to look for on a nearly new car eg checking software is uptodate battery health unlikely to be an issue on a newish car included accessories do renault typically provide a granny charger or type 2 cable weve had a look at a couple of youtube reviews so are aware of the lack of side impact airbags but other than that the zoe looks like an excellent valueformoney proposition ive also seen this really helpful thread apologies theres probably a neater way to link to it stinkypete said hello all ive been somewhat absent from this forum for the last few years and feel a little guilty for returning with much in the way of questions and little in the way of answers in my defence my 2016 r220 zoe has been a sterling car aside from the pec replacement early in its life so it has kind of faded to the back of my mind as other aspects of my life have come to the fore anyway to get back on topic the lack of range in my r220 combined with the awkwardness of planning routes to take in 22kw ac chargers has led me to contemplate moving on to a ze50 which leads me to my questions aside from crackling when charging bms update preconditioning issues i know this was a thing but i cant seem to find any related threads on this forum perhaps im just not using the right search terms timed charging issues is there anything else that i need to look out for on a 2020 zoe and what of the 2021 zoes were all of these issues fixed by the time 2021 rolled around im wondering if theres any advantage to spending extra money to get a 2021 zoe and hopefully avoid any teething troubles that affected the early ze50s any help or advice would be appreciated and if you made it this far thank you for taking the time to read my verbose post pete  any advicethoughts would be glad to hear from you

2019-05-06,SpeakEV,davebev said out of interest where does the 3kg of co2 litre of petrol come from  i first came across it in various posts on this forum there are several carbon calculators from authoritative sites eg us epa and others that give carbon content calculations for 1 litre of petrol well you need to convert from us gallons and they call it gasoline which are around the 2324kg range but these values do not include the carbon cost that goes into refining oil into petrol or diesel that adds about 30 for petrol and 25 for diesel this means that burning a litre of petrol in a car accounts for about 3kg of carbon note pedants will quibble over small percentages associated with the above figures however its a reasonable estimate imo i would also accept that minor differences are significant when multiplied over millionsbillions of vehicles and miles but for the purpose of illustration these numbers are ok having driven petrol and diesel powered vehicles for almost 40 years id never realised that fuel was so carbon intensive id guessed that the carbon cost was about 1kgl based purely upon mass ive a phd in life sciences and have always been a bit crap at chemistry i suspect most consumers dont realise this and some most wont care the thing to keep in mind about the greenness of electric cars is that their carbon cost comes partly from manufacture and partly from the source of electricity to power them so if you only burn coal to make leccy theres not much carbon saving if any electric cars are a little more carbon intensive to make than ice ones due to the battery but this can be repaid once you start driving them using a mixed with renewables electricity grid theres estimates out there of how many miles you need to cover for different models to reach breakeven and then start saving for me id surmise that my ev is saving about 50 of the carbon versus an ice modest and makes for better air quality plus its waaaay more enjoyable to drive

2020-02-15,SpeakEV,sidehaas said its not just about the impact of an ev now vs the impact of an ice now though i hope not too many people are under the illusion that if they run an ev their impact is zero any more than if they have a magical 100 renewable energy tariff what its really about for me is the direction of travel in ten years time we almost all need to be driving evs and we need to be generating much more of our electricity without gas if we are to meet our climate targets for there to be a chance of that those of us who can should be starting to drive evs now because we cant all change at once because i was in a position that i was able to do so now i felt like i should its also about setting an example and showing people who are more nervous of the change that evs are actually good cars now the more there are on the road the better from that perspective the immediate carbon reduction is obviously a benefit but i completely agree with you it is not huge  because the rest of the world is using renewables while we hobble ourselves the public at large are absolutely under the impression that if they suddenly drive an ev they are somehow carbon neutral the ev will magically offset all their other middle class carbon use such as multiple holidays abroad and huge houses i remember working 2 summers ago when the climate protests were on in london i had upper middle class patients call in on the way to ferrying their offspring to climate protests in their rangerovers lol honestly the irony is so lost on them they had no idea buy and ev but continue to consume all we can lol meanwhile we have shifted all our manufacturing to the 3rd world and east so while we may not be polluting our own back yard the poor chinese indian indonesian person can have the water table toxins but were zero carbon in the uk just done mention our amazon buying habits

2021-10-26,SpeakEV,hey all were in the process of ordering a level 3 electric for delivery in the new year like many we absolutely love the car but are slightly concerned about range as londoners 99 of the time itll be absolutely outstanding however we are a tad concerned about what sort of range to expect when were doing longer journeys they seldom happen 12 times a year but when they do theyre typically long and were not on a jolly but instead aiming to get from a to b as fast as possible we currently have a c350e phev and have made the 1000 mile trip from london to bratislava numerous times before with an overnight in frankfurt during our last trip i made a concerted effort to plug the car in at every services we visited and im pleased to say that across belgium germany and austria we were able to activate ac chargers without issue adding ccs and bringing ionity into the mix means im not concerned about finding chargers as theyre plentiful along the e40 in belgium the a3 that takes us across germany and the route across austria what does worry me slightly is how often well need to stop my test drive gave me a chance to loosely measure consumption at about 220whkm in mild 14degree conditions doing 7075mph but im not sure what range to expect of the car with the heat pump running with thicker air to power through in 03 degree temperatures would 100 miles of range be achievable ingreen mode and at a reduced speed of 120kmh75mph obviously only time will tell but id be interested to hear the winter motorway range experiences of owners on this forum to have a rough idea of how many stops the trip will truly require otherwise it may just be all too hard and require the plane
2021-10-26,SpeakEV,hobbyist said not trying to derail your thread but unless you have your hearts and mind set on the mini have you looked at other cars with better range and similar size and money such as the fiat 500e or the zoe they are not as fun to drive as the mini but more practical range wise the fiat also has 85kw dc and also is extremely efficient  i have indeed and its a valid point but i just love the mini that bit too much if im going to be paying and spending a heap of time in it for the foreseeable future i want as little compromise as possible i just dont like the fiat and its even less practical than the mini space wise whod have thunk it and the zoe was just a bit bland to me something about the mini but then im biased because im a mini person would rather buy something that ill love to drive everyday but cant use for a longer trip once a year than something which feels like a tool as opposed to a not so electrically simple pleasure on a daily basis but thats just me
2018-10-20,SpeakEV,personally i would suggest that you just include any costs in an increased rate 1day averaged over your ev and nonev customers will probably offset any additional electricity use otherwise i would as a customer pay a one off fee 10 for using the charger but not a per day what if i dont need it however i would choose a rental with free charging in preference for the simplicity as others have said some form of metering would put me right off penny pinching on this means penny pinching elsewhere so id be assuming that no doubt there would be ratty carpets saggy sofas and only one dishwasher tablet too
2014-12-12,SpeakEV,these days i drive almost no miles i mean i regard it as almost none i have a 4 mile commute that i could walk in less than an hour if i really needed to and if it wasnt for the 80 mile familyvisit trip i do once a fortnight or longer i probably would do just that and walk it yet that still adds up to 6000 miles plus the vey rare bits of shopping and an outing to a national trust or such im not particularly sociable so really next to no excess mileage above that i can look to be doing about 7000 a year at the moment for basically no miles a year from my pov so my question of the hour why do people even bother to get a car if a 5000 miles a year lease would cover their needs its always struck me and i feel it is as true now as when i said it in the age of 22kwh cars if you do too few miles an ev is likely too expensive and not worth it and if you do too many then an ev wont suit bevs live in a range of golden miles and as i have alluded to in other threads not only on cost but also on co2 grounds right now this precise moment it makes more sense for me personally to stick with an efficient euro 6 diesel im not in that golden zone of miles that makes bev a particularly sensible option im not wanting to debate the relative calculations and for someone looking for a new car and in different circumstances they will have different needs and outcomes but the thrust of my thesis here is that anyone who only needs 5k miles a year probably doesnt need any miles at all id have said these days with batteries as they are if you are doing 12k to 15k miles a year youd be pretty dumb not to go for a bev 15k to 30k a bev will pay in spades if it covers your particular mileage or you probably could do with a phev to eek out the dino juice or above 30k really it is an ice for you at 5k to 12k it will depend very much on your circumstances if you already have a car whether it makes sense to swap it out like mine short trips with occasional long or regular 50 mile round trip commute ice or bev is usually fairly clear 5k get a bike

2020-02-05,SpeakEV,padrino said i dont really think that this is clear cut and dry situation perhaps this was an issue at the beginning of the ev era today is a different picture all together they are a few forums tesla mainly with discussion about battery life and degradation over the pond they have virtually thousands upon thousands cars with over 300k on the clocks and average degradation for this sort of a mileage is about 12 i personally wouldnt be worried too much for a start almost all ev manufacturers are offering 810 years and 100k miles warranty on drive train and batteries this is a lot more than any ice car for a start if the manufacturers are confident enough to provide this kind of cover for me this is indication that the expectations are for at least another 5060k miles on top of the 100k offered as warranty just drive the damn thing and dont worry too much  you are right except that charging is a frequently discussed and pretty infected subject even on other forums not just tesla i am on a bmw i4 also and it can get pretty hot over there as well unless you agree with the mainstream which is literally never go below 20 and never charge above 80 of course that is nonsense but there are many who believe that those values are some sort of brick wall my logic says the same as your logic even if my battery is degraded by 1015 after 100k miles that will take many years and if in say 510 years time my range will drop by 1015 well who cares if the range drops too much ie noticeably lower then there is the battery warranty anyway

2023-01-27,SpeakEV,metaphysical said this has made me change my holiday plans well go sussex instead and spend our money there a great shame but you will lose out cornwall if you cant get your act together and start to cater for ev cars  this seems slightly overdramatic its really not that big of a deal fast dc charge up if you need to in devon and again in camborne then if you need to hook up the granny for overnight top ups its really not that bad
2023-04-21,PistonHeads,i think full ev is the only and last chance for jaguar and its a market where there is zero point as of yet in building a product for folk without money without income without driveways and then there is zero point in going after the standard german stuff on driveways i suspect for a modest volume producer in an expensive country the only sane option is to target the market thats buying range rovers taycans which is clearly large enough when one considers the modern history of jaguar as large cars very smooth to drive and with large engines capable of delivering large levels of relaxing torque then shrinking those large engines down to 3 pot turbo screamers to meet emission and tax criteria was a nonstarter only pure ev delivers on brand values and expectations and as theyve not been successful in selling off jaguar this is their only sane step forward theyre still going to be hobbled by lr being the suv arm but a big gt and some crossovers of varying size should be enough especially as all the tuareg based suvs seem to be much closer to being crossovers now than twenty years ago when they had to try and pretend to look like 4x4s i do hope jag succeed as theres a great heritage there and theyve spent the last 20 years either kicking themselves in the balls or being kicked in the balls by others its certainly very bold deciding to build in the ukagree completely with respect to the highlighted we have one of each of a ffrr and taycan as daily drivers the taycan will soon go when another ffrr will arrive much as id sometimes prefer the driving dynamics of a large saloon the market seems to have moved on from them range rovers of various sizes really are the default choice for quite a few people which presents a further problem for jlr the jaguar brand isnt strong enough to go after the very top end bentley etc so jaguars strategy in the 100k sector relies on it cannibalising sales from its sibling and that sibling isnt going to not offer evs
2023-04-21,PistonHeads,range rovers of various sizes really are the default choice for quite a few people which presents a further problem for jlr the jaguar brand isnt strong enough to go after the very top end bentley etc so jaguars strategy in the 100k sector relies on it cannibalising sales from its sibling and that sibling isnt going to not offer evs quitei have a ffrr but if it was the mid 90s i would have had an xj all day longthe biggest problem is that now the range rover goes round corners does reasonable mpg cruises comfortably at mororway speeds it does everything the old range rovers did plus everything the xj did as wellthis ad could be for a ffrr
2023-04-21,PistonHeads,thats it in a nutshellfor as long as anyone can remember the xj was jaguar and that market is disappearing rightly or wronglyeven the a8 7er are really halo products these days theres little other point in making them the remaining market is the sclass because traditionso what could jaguar do no good merely copying the taycan because if people want one theyll buy the porsche traditionjaguar tried copying bmw and the same rule appliedits really hard to imagine quite what it would take not to produce another metoo product with no real uspmy fear is that jaguar is now damaged goods like alfa and will no longer be taken seriously in the real market outside of us aficionados however well they make it
2023-04-21,PistonHeads,great news just make it beautiful and you will have western exbmw buyers queueingbuilt right and specced right i can see this being an interesting competitor to the audi gt and taycanhear hear im sad to see the xj go wonder what was wrong with the electric xj which meant the project needed to be canned at the 11th hour hopefully this marks a lovely returnjust wish i had 100k going spare for one had a rummage down the back of the sofa and im thinking that 32p and a dusty mm wont quite cut it

,PistonHeads,theyre old fashioned ugly but supposedly efficient and se spec is well appointed even with cooledvented seats i dont need speed as i have a caterham for that but shopping and popping on a 100 mile round trip is all it will be used for
,PistonHeads,if it floats your boat then go for it i think you could go with any ev on the use case worrying about the efficiency to some degree is unnecessary as its really only a function of consumption and battery size the results in a given maximum range
,PistonHeads,we had one as a courtesy car for a few months while our leaf was being fixed really enjoyed having it good family hatch and really well specced 5 miles per kwh easily achievable probably my only criticisms are the high boot floorfastback shape impinges on carry space and 50kw max charge rate is a bit old hat now so longer journeys will be a pain
,PistonHeads,if it floats your boat then go for it i think you could go with any ev on the use case worrying about the efficiency to some degree is unnecessary as its really only a function of consumption and battery size the results in a given maximum range with electricity prices as they are i think efficiency is a very real concern for many people increasing efficiency also increases both range and effective charging speed without the need for enormous battery packs
,PistonHeads,with electricity prices as they are i think efficiency is a very real concern for many people increasing efficiency also increases both range and effective charging speed without the need for enormous battery packs will depend on your electricity tariff i imagine for 12k miles per year the difference between a car doing 25 mileskwh and 5 mileskwh on something like ovo anytime 10p kwh is 20 a month i appreciate we live in tough times for some but if you can afford to buy an ev in the first place is 66p a day really a concern
,PistonHeads,thanks all looks are subjective and as i do not consider it nice but its not to bought to adorn and impress the neighbours as for tariff well we live in the sticks no mobile reception for a smart meter so on tariff that is on our current plan it will go up in october ive just read that the ioniq is the quickest depreciating electric car available so will have to look at a deal very closely as it might be better to not get one in the long run yes s overall is important as im retiredi havent looked at the golf but werent they discontinued a number of years ago im looking at a 2272 platehttpscardealermagazinecoukpublishhyundaiioniqnamedasevthatlosesconsumersthemostamongelectriccars283398edited by sherbertdip on sunday 7th may 1642

,PistonHeads,the zoe is a flawed car ill agree with you there headroom in the back is very poor and the lack of height adjustability in the seat is not good seats have very little lateral support and the rear seats are like a church pew neither is there a drivers armrest a 150 extratypical renault quirks as well like complicated steering wheel controls just to to toggle audio volumebut overall i thought the new zoe was not a bad little car it drove well and visibility was not bad as a cheap ev its quite good i was getting around 195 miles on a charge which i thought wasnt too bad i was impressed with the interior quality all the knobs and switches felt high quality as did the general fit and finish like the leatherette on the dash and the interesting headlining much better than clios of oldi had the iconic trim car and used it as a daily for 8 weeksbut maybe youre right the ioniq is probably much better as a car for the money if you can live with the reduced rangetheres no denying how good vfm a used ioniq isim still not sure i would be looking past a used stellantis ev though whats the real range on a corsae then

,PistonHeads,i think they should in the past few years i hear more and more from drivers who are sick of nannying tech one last week ditched his new lr defender 62k and bought an old discovery because he hated the lane assist emergency braking and continual bings and bongsmy wife had a new insignia as a company car a few years ago when youd locked it and started walking away you could still hear it bonging about stuff to itself modern cars are becoming the equivalent of paying tens of thousands of pounds to have a digital mother in law crippled with dunningkruger endlessly nagging whittering on about rubbish panicking over nothing and generally criticising everything its just another unfortunate area where the normal intelligent majority are having their life invaded by an incessant need to nanny the idiots having cars soil themselves due to a hedge confusing a bollard with a child or fannying about with the steering wheel when youre crossing a road marking is remarkably tiresome and distracting finding a well build good car that isnt a passive aggressive invasive japanese toilet is becoming a holy grail
,PistonHeads,aside from changing an air bag which will obviously make the score worse how else has the car changedi understand the need to make the tests more stringent over time to a degree but its getting a bit daft now i also cant help there should be two scores one for active safety auto brake and such and passive safety to make things a bit clearerlikewise i think that the crash avoidance stuff should be separated from the crash performance score i also think that the pedestrianvulnerable road user aspects should be a dedicated score as the importance of this varies wildly depending upon how an individual uses their car much more valuable to somebody who does most of their driving in urban areas than to someone who covers thousands of motorway miles where pedestrians and cyclists and so on are not encounteredtrying to amalgamate all this into a single score isnt terribly helpful and leads to this omg this car is so unsafe narrative which in most cases is disingenuous a previously 5 star car is not suddenly a death trap just because its tech has been superseded
,PistonHeads,likewise i think that the crash avoidance stuff should be separated from the crash performance score i also think that the pedestrianvulnerable road user aspects should be a dedicated score as the importance of this varies wildly depending upon how an individual uses their car much more valuable to somebody who does most of their driving in urban areas than to someone who covers thousands of motorway miles where pedestrians and cyclists and so on are not encounteredthey already are separate scores its that that all of the different individual scores get rolled up into a single overall one the zoe got43 for adult occupancy52 for child occupancy 41 for vulnerable road user 14 for safety assist each of those things will have different importance for different people which is presumably why they public them as individual scores to put that in perspective by comparing it to another small bev the fiat 500e just got 76 80 67 and 67 for those categories edited by kambites on thursday 9th december 1110
,PistonHeads,a lot of the active safety tech isnt mature so i can see the logic for people avoiding that at the moits why euroncap test it thoroughly if fitted just aeb has more than a dozen scenarios they testmost damning for me on the zoe was the difference the newer cheaper airbag setup made httpstwittercomcilldarstatus146865825745992the biggest thing id like to see is clearer marking of what testing a rating was done against and how long ago renault were advertising a car as 5star euroncap in 2021 from a rating done in 2013 the car has been substantially revised twice since
,PistonHeads,to put that in perspective by comparing it to another small bev the fiat 500e just got 76 80 67 and 67 for those categories edited by kambites on thursday 9th december 1110 all whilst costing 4k less renault need to seriously up their game and focus more on this stuff than fitting ever larger batteries to what is essentially a city car with a 250 mile range but a max charge rate of only 46kw
,PistonHeads,so they changed the design of the side airbags and it went from a 5 star car to a zero star car that doesnt seem rightnope it was a 5 star car when originally tested back in 2013 at launch since then there have been many changes in ncap protocols these protocols generally change every 2 years since 2013 to 2021 the zoe has remained largely unchanged yet ncap testing protocols have changed many times with testing becoming far stricter hence why the zoe is now a zero star car it is no less safe now than it was in 2013edited by htp99 on thursday 9th december 1203
,PistonHeads,very few cars produced 8 years ago would get more than 1 or 2 stars overall now even if they got 5 when new it is a bit crap that theyve made it less safe though

,PistonHeads,heres mine pro model magic blue and all options best car ive owned in 20years of motoring and excellent tow car was shocked when volvo pulled them from the uk lineup thats bloody lovely would have loved something with all the toys budgets constrain however however good news for you v90 and v60 are back in the lineup for the uk confirmed by hq a couple of months ago now available to order my cousin asked me if i wanted one on finance for a massive discount he works at volvo however not the right time for mesuch an arse to park though in a narrow car park just too long doesnt even fit in the space at work without a camera its especially tricky as the sensors dont come on automatically upon selecting reverse camera is first on the list
,PistonHeads,check the sensor volume in the settings when mines been in the garage they tend to turn them right down they should come on automatically on reverse yeah its a bloody pain parking my cc has same footprint as a range rover give or take a few mm

,PistonHeads,the acceleration there is the acceleration to the end of ice carsthere are more ev supercars in development and they will continue to break records of course there will be transitional arguments the nürburgring ev record vs the ice record but in the end there will be only one record that mattersfastest production caras a diehard ice fan this makes me sad but the writing is on the wall
,PistonHeads,in 10 years will a audi a3 do 060 in 35 seconds will a basic fiat 500e be doing 60 in 5 seconds etc i wonder given acceleration is a function a 1 gear high torque will firms start to limit acceleration electronicallystill want 250 miles range and a 5 min or less charge more than i want blink of an eye accelerationthing is power and acceleration capabilities are not really in relation to range because theyre to do with the motors if you made an ev with 1000bhp and gave it batteries for a 250 mile range by decreasing the motor to make it only a 200bhp car will still mean it has a 250 mile range unlike with an ice car
,PistonHeads,it must have sticky tyres or downforce or both to achieve those figures sticky tyres would help downforce would likely hinder

,PistonHeads,im a bit old school as im an old fool so prefer a magnficent engine turning fossils into noise and speed but by crikey can that thing shift the looks are a bit samey as all the other leccy beasts though to my eye its a bit better looking than the dullish rimac and i prefer it just slightly to the evija still not sure id want an electric supercar but the inevitable march to full electfication of our personal transport doesnt seem all bad when you see the art of the possible as expressed in this filthyfast rocket sled
,PistonHeads,its like science fiction nowadays even a fairly run of the mill ev is batst fastwatched a white taycan turbo go through the gridlocked town centre earlier during dropping my youngest at the station as he was about to miss his train the reg sort of spelt zoom appropriate and the owner got a say 200 metre gap due to the lights and absolutely hoofed it obviously no noise but no drama either it squatted and off it went then heavy braking for the trafficthey move differently to ice cars its more akin to watching a race car in the speed of it picking up quicker than a lot of competition cars i bet as well it was otherworldly but then thought what a stupid thing to do at rush hour in a 30 past the route to a high school for those lacking restraint 2 and a bit tons of metal getting to double the speed limit in two and a bit seconds is a bit of a liability i know that the brakes will be good but the advantage in acceleration vs an ice car is massive the braking isnt really any better or certainly not that much better
,PistonHeads,i know some people struggle with the idea of losing ice cars but really when road vehicles account for 15 of co2 emissions aviation gets a lot of attention for its impact on climate change but it only accounts for 25 of emissions their end cant come soon enough some things are more important than the noise we hear when driving carssource httpsourworldindataorgco2emissionsfromtrani agree in part thing is there are 30 million or so combustion engined cars and 99 percent are not enthusiast cars and could be replaced with an evclassics and specialist ice are such an infinitesimally small part of the problem usually driven tiny mileages and garaged the rest of the time seems churlish to tell someone they cant drive their ice when china etc are throwing up coal fired power stationsa blanket ban and the end of them entirely is a draconian way to think and probably the wrong forum for it we need to get our act in order but someone taking a sunday drive in their classic or sportscar is pretty low down the hit list its like horse enthusiasts can still manage to enjoy their hobby and by and large it doesnt hurt anyone elsei just cycled to do a couple of errands thats what we need more of where the car isnt the default go to choice for everything ev or otherwise emissions are one thing but cars have utterly taken over in town and city centres to the detriment of any other methods of getting abouti know evs arent perfect ecologically but when i compare my neighbours taycan starting up and gliding away vs my sons diesel golf then that noise isnt missed but when the austin healey 1006 next door but one starts up that sounds nice and even dont mind the pungent waft of its exhaust every few weeks

,PistonHeads,it must have sticky tyres or downforce or both to achieve those figures sticky tyres would help downforce would likely hinderno downforce wouldnt hinder you need extra downforce or sticky tyres to achieve acceleration greater than 1 g the downforce acts like additional weight so increases the friction that is why f1 cars can corner at lateral accelerations greater than 1 grealistically most cars cant beat 08 g and that is on a good road with good tyres

,PistonHeads,yesa basic tesla will murder themthats before we pull out the performancei think misinformation like this probably highlights the decline of the hot hatch market the fastest price comparable tesla model 3 long range is 50k and 060 is 42sec take a bog standard golf r that is 45k and goes 060 in 41sec add in the golf r being significantly better to drive at every level and just as practical as a private buyer into cars youd have to be mad to not take the golf r i think some people just arent that aware unfortunately how fast and competent modern hot hatches have actually become id wager most tesla model 3s would be in serious trouble even trying to keep up with a fiesta st or i20n down a b road never mind the segment above or on a track the new tesla model 3 performance will be a 60k car which unfortunately for the tesla puts it into bmw m2 or audi rs3 category edited by cg2020uk on friday 23 february 1710
,PistonHeads,the selfish no where im sitting but its in a cycle of a slighty dying im about to put 310 bhp in a mk7 fiesta so i may well be dead in a hot hatch if thats what you mean pretty much what i have its a riot if you havent already budget for an lsd i want to get an m4 soon but cant bear to part with it i know i will get the bmw and then miss it so will hang on to it they will be fairly sought after down the line i think thats a given when the current boy racers want to relive their youth there will be no new options that arent electric
,PistonHeads,this always seems to come up people seem obsessed with straight line speed a tesla will not deliver thrills like a clio 172 will the tesla will be faster but you wont be grinning throwing it down a b road the same way that you will in a hot hatch the 90s and early 00s had the best hot hatches the choice has been slowly dwindling since then to the point of now where yes the hot hatch just isnt what it was and never will behot hatches are dead people seem content with an electric car thatll do 060 in 3 seconds but be utterly boring to throw aroundexactly taking off like a stabbed rat is fun the first few times but all its really doing is making the bushes go by a bit faster if youre just driving around town it might as well be a 16 diesel whereas with an actually fun car you can always make it enjoyable by chucking it round a junction on three wheelsnobody in their right mind drives a diesel for town use only it is completely unsuited and it screws up the dpf filter nimble evs will come in fact my i3s embaresses a few hot hatches albeit the suspension needs modifying what you may not realise is evs have a very low cog and polar moment unlike an ice the weight location is ideal for a hot hatchmanufactures are out to make a profit and when they produced a hot hatch version of a small family car the economics worked as a big chunk of the vehicle was the mass produced monocoque electric harness instruments and much of the running gear as ices are no longer being developed there is no base vehicle on which to base future ice hot hatchesweve been lumbered with suv because sadly thats what people have wanted for quite a long time now and well before ev the idea largely imported from the usa much like thie grim and pointless trucks currently ev development has been at the higher cost end for obvious reasons this is already beginning to change

2023-07-31,PistonHeads,not quite so tiny but the bmw i3 is a fantastic ev which is incredibly easy to operate great around town and in 120ah guise will do between 130180 miles dependent on weather conditionsyour 15k should get you into a low mileage 201920 example and having run on for 12 monhs and 20k miles previously i can highly recommend weve had a number of evs since the i3 and are considering another in future
2023-07-31,PistonHeads,seat mii electrics are starting around 10k now for used which imo is a bargain i had one on a cheap lease deal for 2 years and it was perfect decent range fun to drive etc

2023-07-31,PistonHeads,my personal view is stick with or buy a small petrol car that is ulez compliant plenty about small evs are just too expensive

2023-07-31,PistonHeads,not quite so tiny but the bmw i3 is a fantastic ev which is incredibly easy to operate great around town and in 120ah guise will do between 130180 miles dependent on weather conditionsyour 15k should get you into a low mileage 201920 example and having run on for 12 monhs and 20k miles previously i can highly recommend weve had a number of evs since the i3 and are considering another in futurei concur the i3 would be a great choice and has a reasonably high driving position and much more space than then the smarti owned a smart years ago and found it not a pleasant drive with an appalling gearbox perhaps the newer ice ones are better the ev version should have no such gearbox issues i suppose if really small was considered a benefit then the renault twizzy could be a consideration although personally i would discount its as too small and limited
2023-07-31,PistonHeads,hypothetical questionshow long will current compliant cars stay compliant pay per mile seems likely in the future and will pure ev be exempt cheaperdavidtheyll be compliant as long as enough money keeps rolling in 1250 to kick out whatever crap you fancy for 24 hours colud be considered a bargain compared to 15 grand upfront on an ev once weve got a decent percentage of evs theyll switch to road charginghonestly for that sort of use save ten grand and buy a petrol supermini

2023-07-31,PistonHeads,ive previously owned an i3 and an eup id opt for the vw every day of the week
2023-07-31,PistonHeads,ive previously owned an i3 and an eup id opt for the vw every day of the week sorry to hijack but why im leaning the other way but havent driven either much longer commute than the ops daughter though 32 miles each way
2023-07-31,PistonHeads,duke ive previously owned an i3 and an eup id opt for the vw every day of the week sorry to hijack but why im leaning the other way but havent driven either much longer commute than the ops daughter though 32 miles each wayplenty of reasons bearing in mind that im comparing an early my14 i3 with a my20 eup with the 2nd gen battery pack reliability eup was reliable and had zero niggles in 2 years whereas the i3 was the most unreliable car ive ever owned it was so bad that bmw paid me compensation for how many times it had to be booked in for work all sorts of issues charging failures wonky door hinges failed motor mounts lim replaced twice etc im sure owners of later i3s will tell you this is better now id happily own an eup out of warranty in fact i gave my eup to my elderly mum and have no concerns about that whereas theres no way id own an i3 out of warranty range eup had more than double the range yes newer i3s are improved efficiency eup was significantly more efficient therefore cheaper to run easy to get 6 mkwh see the lowly mii thread for other owners experiences rear doors eup has normal doors not those silly ones on the i3 where rear passengers cant get out without assistance from front passengers and be an utter pain in confined spaces looks eup is a more inconspicuous car if you value that driving eup is a lot of fun to drive maybe call this category a draw but its better than youd expect and doesnt suffer from the cross wind jitteriness of the i3 cost eup was 167 a month the i3 was more than double just not worth the difference imo the main negative of the eup is slow dc charging for the op this wouldnt be a problem but if youre looking to do a lot of long distance trips i wouldnt be considering an eup nor an i3
,PistonHeads,i am surprise to see 201920 examples going for less than 40k when they are costing nearly 100k newi read a few reviews and the range seems to be fairly poor due to the weight and 1st gen tech however nearly 60 off in 23 years for an electricwhat is wrong with this car
,PistonHeads,youre right op they are cheap i noticed this and was thinking they looked great value interesting at last i have found someone that thinks the samelocal audi they dont really want them back off pcp as users are wary about sh pure electric stuff and the market reflects this he was also trying to stick me into a new one which i dont wantsame doesnt seem to apply to taycans but i like the look of the audi used pure ev market must still be very immature watch this space i guess
,PistonHeads,strange thing is a full range of 190ish miles maybe 150 in real world is more than enough for the vast majority of people most of the time but it just seems pants compared to 400 miles in a petrol model or 300 in a newer eva mate of mine has one and it is fine day to day but they have to jump into his wifes mini to go to their house in the lakes which he hadnt considered when he ordered it got sick of driving with no heating or electrics on

,PistonHeads,i agree our plan is to have an ev for local pottering which is probably 90 of what we do and a proper car for longer journeys

,PistonHeads,i can see the arguments for having an electric car for local stuff and an ice car for long journeys as a number of posters suggest i guess if that is the preferred option for families buying evs theres not a huge need for a big suv to do the local stuff and thats the type of car you want for the family holidays etc which means the audi is stuck somewhere between the two
,PistonHeads,i cant stand the shape of the up but i have been looking at the vw polo gt and gti they do look rather boring style wise throughthe polo is really is a smaller golf so follows the design i and many others have trouble telling them apart as the differences are small this was the best review id found of the gti when i was looking at themhttpsyoutubeqk7wny6qxn0the racetrack section of the video was particularly good
,PistonHeads,i20n maybethe only ones ive seen are all over 10 seconds to reach 60mphno mate the n as been out over 12 months now just take a little time to keep up with the times its a different proposition perhaps thinking of the i20 n linethe i20n starts at well over 20k and is sub 7 secs to 60 manual only tooof all the ice suggestions here so far i think the black clio rs220 trophy that zx posted looks the best the polo might actually be a better car and looks good value but the rs clio is more interesting a 5dr cooper s could be worth a look they seem to come with various seat options so not necessarily going to be the same as in the mini electric 5 door might suit better toootherwise i still think the ev options look good for the op if they live in london and drive regularly in the city
,PistonHeads,ok it may be a bit too long at 45m but the cupra formentor hybrid 245 is good fun to drive and pretty quick to 60 75 ish i thinki think the caution of hybrids maybe battery longevity all depends how long youre planning on keeping the car reallyfor 18khmmm might have missed that that could indeed be problematic
,PistonHeads,bmw i3s brilliant fun c180hp not hugely fast but light for an ev i see mine as a modern day interpretation of my old mk2 golf gti smallish but great turning circle and practical stuff like that 18k should get you into an early 120ah bev model about 68 plate like mine we have a fleet at work and the driving experience is horrible at least to me they bounce a lot and take time to settle back theyre tall and slab sided so very sensitive to cross winds theyre hard to drive smoothly because of the regenerative braking the tyres are like bike tyres so they really dont drive like a normal car the i3 is a real oddity to me every time i drive one i cant understand how bmw who were renowned for driving dynamics could have produced it on the plus side the power train is very nice but id rather have a corsa e over the i3
,PistonHeads,perhaps thinking of the i20 n linethe i20n starts at well over 20k and is sub 7 secs to 60 manual only tooof all the ice suggestions here so far i think the black clio rs220 trophy that zx posted looks the best the polo might actually be a better car and looks good value but the rs clio is more interesting a 5dr cooper s could be worth a look they seem to come with various seat options so not necessarily going to be the same as in the mini electric 5 door might suit better toootherwise i still think the ev options look good for the op if they live in london and drive regularly in the cityi hadnt noticed the n after the i20 did look at them today but yes too expensive for meive been looking at the clio rs cars they do look very good so will put on my test drive list i also want to test drive a polo so will look into those models i would really like to test drive the fiat 500e but my partner is against it saying they lose 50 of range when driving at 70mph on the motorway so not really suitable for weekends away etc

,PistonHeads,the new fiat 500e can be ordered today in euro markets with a special launch edition available at a starting price of 37500httpswwwmotor1comnews402135newfiat500edso i guess the question is why would you get one of these instead of a honda e

,PistonHeads,tethered wallbox pulsar maxuntethered easee one or syncevyou wont go wrong with any of them and all are easy to use if your car has a delayed charging facility so it charges overnight you can just set it up on the car if not any charger can do this too but it is better to get the car to do it igf it canas a hypervolt owner i agree with frimley to be fair ive had no major issues with hypervolt only a few niggles but it was overhyped and not lived up to my expectations maybe thats down to me but i feel let down and disappointed with my purchase i enjoyed the 350 ozev grant so cost only 569 including installation id think long and hard before paying what they cost now
,PistonHeads,no ideas for a using a 32a outlet is fine as long at it is installed in a manner to be used to supply an ev via an evse this largely means to have suitable earth protection easiest and in my opinion best method is simply an earth rodi dont understand the resistance no pun to earth rods on hereother options existthe problem is the very idea of it most chargers are fixed where to an external wall what is below an existing external wallfoundations above which is usually a drive or some form of hard standingnever mind the difficulties in getting a good earth in various ground types such as sand etc

,PistonHeads,the main challenge is putting in a 1m rod and not knowing what is under the ground although unlikely you could hit one of the house services which often dont run where you expect also this means running a cable to the earth rod which doesnt look very nice and some homes have concretedpaved paths around them meaning you need to get them up to run the cable to soft groundfair pointsthis is an easy one at my place up against the boundary fence no services near it removed gravel banged 24m of rod in earth cable is in a duct underneath so looks neathowever the other one all the problems you mention close to house wall the mud on the left is actually sitting on top of the wall foundations the brown item on the right is a 110mm drain so some excavation required to confirm location before knocking it in duct for earth cable and earth pit yet to be fitted in that photobut much better than relying on a multipole relaycontactor to disconnect all the connections to an external evsei am lead to believe that all new builds are getting earth rods at least around here so hopefully that is less of a problem as time goes on
,PistonHeads,no ideas for a i am lead to believe that all new builds are getting earth rods at least around here so hopefully that is less of a problem as time goes onnot the case most local planning departments will insist on a 32amp feed for the provision of a car charger which to be fair ive been installing now anyways but earthing rods simply arent necessary for all chargers nor suitable for all ground typeswhere i build its almost exclusively sand based ground and you simply cant get a good enough earth
,PistonHeads,no ideas for a i am lead to believe that all new builds are getting earth rods at least around here so hopefully that is less of a problem as time goes onnot as far as i know the ones we install dont need earth rods in fact most dont these days
,PistonHeads,your son wont be signing off the installation and doing the conditions report though will he there are plenty of chargers that dont require an earring rod or if you dont use a certified installer why would you there are other options people got hung up on the discounted installation cost whereas in reality you cold buy your own charger for 350 and pay a lad 150 to come and wire it up safelyabsolutely correctthe electricians on site are responsible it is their problemit strikes me as odd that they are getting the ground workers to lay rods in a pit and cover with sand i will check over the weekend as it doesnt sound like it will achieve the required outcome to meinstallation i agree not wishing to upset those who are installers on here it looks like most of the work is really building type work the electrical side is fairly simple if a duct or cable is in place however for an ordinary homeowner without that capability they need someone an installer that can do the whole job for them most of the cost must be in doing the prep once you have the cable routes and access in the remainder isnt too hardbut the installer has to do this and cost for it people dont see the value in all of that
,PistonHeads,every installation is different i guess at mine the charger was at the opposite end to the garage so i ran a 25m 6mm cable from the fuse board to the charger and let the spark connect either endfor a lot it will be much simpler

,PistonHeads,i dont think obsolescence is that much of an issue every year there will be cars with better energy density and quicker charge times but not sure thats particularly relevant to existing vehicles which will still be doing what they were bought to do the depreciation aspect is only an issue for people who trade regularly especially as most used evs are post 2020 so still plenty of in play depreciation over the next couple of years but none of that is relevant if holding for a longer period for people who use the same car for as long as ten years they can represent huge bargains i would say that once someone has a usage that clearly and easily fits then the next step is to consider how much a comparable ice will cost to operate per month versus the ev over a good period of time such as 810 years whereby the depreciation will be relatively moot but the potential gains over fuel costs and maintenance could be manifestly superior all cars depreciate to scrap so if held to pretty much that point then the ev probably smashes it but also if in doubt just stick with the current car and run the maths in a couple of years i dont think theres any kind of rush unless where someone uses their ice has a local authority seeking to heavily tax those users this
,PistonHeads,and people talk about shouting at the clouds utterly hilarious and no for the record i didnt vote reform ukip or any other iterations thereof this thread gets ever more pathetic complete joke lately i was agreeing with your point sorry i clearly misinterpreted and missed the tenor of the post
,PistonHeads,this stuff attracts quite the crowd of people who would benefit from some healthy outlets in their livesits tough though when they were younger they had the world at their feet and were free friday nights were go and punch someone for wearing different clothes as a warm up to a saturday of sausagefest pub followed by punching someone from another town whod bussed in for the afternoon in their special uniform all week the little lady who still knew her place was at home cooking and cleaning and there were the seasonal national front rallies that offered a nice day out and some healthy exercise then comes the horror of retirement and a world gone mad youre not supposed to hate someone for just looking different you keep being told that women have the same rights as you as do foreigners you see those people driving range rovers which were once only for people youd prostrate yourself before because they were so superior meanwhile parked two doors down is ones ten year old meriva because some jumped up fancy pants has parked in your private parking space in the public highway opposite your front room your children have become everything you loathe with their fancy german cars silly clothes that dont fit equality in their partnerships and having friends who arent facsimiles of themselves and thats before even getting to their libtard brainwashing too old to step into the street to punch someone and unable to attend a free speech sausage fest because the local flat roofed pubs have become vegan cup cake shops they resort to the safety of road rage and posting on the internet how bad evs and suvs are horses and bicycles are also used by the filth youre not allowed to directly hate so they can have some along with yummy mummies at the school gates in cars you dont think women should be allowed to use the only true constant in life the only friend who has stuck with them through it all and been their guiding light since first becoming an adult keeping them safe from cancerous foods and warning them about all the people who are bad sparing them from the oppressive yoke of logic education and balance are the tabloids the speakers of truth the one constant that always tells them what to believe and what to say while giving them the strength to stand as the thin red line like so many stout english yeomen have before them but this time the foe isnt the french or uppity natives armed with over ripe mangos but truth reason and intelligence as a soldier of ignorance and intolerance they hold the line all across the uk until their fat sharon of 40 years shouts at them that tea is on the table or that its time to go to bed put the bins out or drive the to the range for a new shiny thing all hail faragethats one hell of a rant donkey but who exactly was it aimed at
,PistonHeads,donkeys post on obsolescence is spot on i would sayalso some new cars are still playing catchup i think one of the new byd cars a model 3 knock off cant even do ev charger route planning in the euthe gap in technology is diminishing rapidly the newest taycan is a lot more efficient than the outgoing but you could still roadtrip easily in the old one if toyota in their fantasy dreamland scenario made a cheap solid state battery and put out a new car at 35k with 400 mile range with twice avg efficiency it still wouldnt necessarily be a mustbuy over a lot of other used evs in the last few years
,PistonHeads,all fair points i dont baulk at buying an old ice car even though its not modern tech so shouldnt apply the same to evs i think the financial point is the bigger issue for me but youre right as long as the car does what i need it to the advancement of range and charging speed shouldnt matter

,PistonHeads,personally i think the key re used evs is that none of us know what shape the depreciation curve for them to take but what is absolutely guaranteed is that just like all other generic cars is that they will go to zero so what that means is that we can run the sums really well on a plan to buy and hold but if one prefers to just hold for a short period there is a big variable in just how much of that trend to zero will be front loaded in the first couple of years all we can surmise is that for the next decade or so the most common buyer for aged cars wont be rushing to join the ev market so a lot of demand will remain absent but then there will be very little supply of aged evs for the next decade so that may be moot if i wanted a runabout for just a few years id not bother with a used ev but i have one runabout that is getting on and its replacement would be sat on for many years and as such an ev is a 100 no brainer unlikely to be zero unless the battery is totally knackeredhouse batteries are crazy money last time i looked a 10kwh unit was around 7kat that price and if there is enough space parking an old ev and wiring it up seems viable even a degraded leaf would work i thinkdemand for old car battery packs will set the scrap price of evs

,PistonHeads,yup you dont want to find yourself at 7080 and in the same shoes as folks inside the m25 with an old ice that was good enough to see them out but now gets taxed 1250 to move when someone else can cruise around all day in a 5l sc rangie billowing put far more pollution but not taxed loonie local authorities are peoples potential risk as opposed to the relatively benign too down progressive national policy the 120d thats back in my drive is the first that will get swapped the moment it throws its first big bill its not a bad place to be having an old ice that owes you nothing if youve had your value from it you can dump it on ebay and move oni think the thing is at the moment we cant see much detail too far ahead so its good to buy things which will owe you nothing within 2 or 3 years or even rentlease etc
,PistonHeads,i assume its a car made locally in shenyang by bmw brilliance but what it really shows is that all the eu bhing about chinese govt backing is not the real reason chinese manufacturing is so much cheaper than the eu we are forced to pay huge premiums for used cars in the uk to support overseas businesses and to cover the debt and dividends of these companies the sooner we fling the doors open to global competition for uk sales the better we have no need of any of the brands so they need to be all set against each other to compete for customers and strip them all of their licenses to sell captive house debt at the same time force them all to compete purely on the price of the goods they manufacture roll the dice and see which brands sod off as losers agree 100just think the head of stellantis who make the worst electric cars with terrible range was moaning about a lack of government subsidise and chinese competitionwhy dont stellantis try selling cars with decent range and lower prices instead of their current offering

,PistonHeads,the og so i got access to our portal this morning a large employer and it is with zenith 40 tax payervery underwhelmed with the cost of cars on there i am aware of the state of the electric car market and the lack of residuals will inevitably hit the costs of the lease market but it does seem incredibly steep very ordinary cars like the id3 and model 3 are north of 500 a month netdo company portals fluctuate in price in a similar manner to personal leases ie if cars drop on lease loco there is a chance they will drop on a sal sac portal tooi am in no rush and i know you should buy the deal not the car but i think i may have missed the boat on the 500600 ixs and the various eqsanyone seeing anything of interest not sure how your portal works but if your specing the car from scratch it will cost more i saved about 260 a month by taking a stock car when they came in only choice i had was the colour happy with that to be honest that was with tuskerfor our scheme tusker the deals certainly dont seem to be as competitive as they were at the end of 2023 but i expect a large part of that is teh level of supportr from naufcaturers to shify meytal year end is often a rush to clear the decks or hit targets at one point in december a mercedes eqe was sub 400for the specifc nissan ariya engage mentioned above it is currenty 397 36 months10k milesmetallic with 45 tax relief on our tusker site add 34 40 i think but an in stock evolve trim is 437 and there are 20 of them in stock right now it seems to me the best of for tusker at least of salary sacrifce is for cars that manufafacturers are putitng money behind overall though i dont think our scheme is outrageously expensive given whats included

,PistonHeads,they definitely fluctuate on ours 18 months ago a taycan was 650 net and now is a few kid shy of 1400 assume its a mix of available deals residuals and insurance costs as they need to price it to cover all qualifying employeesafter a test drive i wasnt interested 18 months ago and im not interested now only decent deals are tesla model y and the mg hot hatch i wanted a fiat 500e or electric mini for mrs s rather than me but pcp or pch are massively cheaper i guess the only exception would be if you were young and insurance ran into thousands per year which was the main reason i had company cars in my 20s the year i ordered my first one the company car tax was less than half of my best insurance quote good to know it isnt just ours then taycan isnt on it at all at the momenti am happy to stretch the man maths calculator as ours is an all in scheme in terms of maintenance and servicinglike you i do think if i cant make it work for me a volvo ex30 or the like could be good for the other half but that is knocking on 500 a month for a car with a relatively low for our scheme tusker the deals certainly dont seem to be as competitive as they were at the end of 2023 but i expect a large part of that is teh level of supportr from naufcaturers to shify meytal year end is often a rush to clear the decks or hit targets at one point in december a mercedes eqe was sub 400for the specifc nissan ariya engage mentioned above it is currenty 397 36 months10k milesmetallic with 45 tax relief on our tusker site add 34 40 i think but an in stock evolve trim is 437 and there are 20 of them in stock right now it seems to me the best of for tusker at least of salary sacrifce is for cars that manufafacturers are putitng money behind overall though i dont think our scheme is outrageously expensive given whats includedyeah i think those sorts of deals are probably where i will jump in if bm start punting ix40s for circa 600 a month net for the base car currently 950 with sky lounge and comfort plus 820 bog standard msportfor reference we are showing up the ariya engage pro pilot assist and comfort pack not sure if they all have this for 444 net for 40 tax payer so i hope our scheme is broadly competitivealthough we too zenith are showing the ariya as being available as a stock car but that doesnt give a price it gives a number to call so the price above is for ordering but guessing a number of ariyas are sitting around somewhere

,PistonHeads,a confluence of factors have prompted me to consider buying my first ev my fun car is now also quite capable for long trips so the sensible car doesnt have to cross continents however id still like to have halfdecent range as the fun car may not be suitable to use in all circumstancesthe ev would live on a driveway so id hope home charging wont be a problem driving is mixed a and b roads and dual carriageways motorways likely less urban although it will see some usage is mostly weekends going up to 40 miles each way for a walkcyclecanoe it will probably see occasional longer trips up to 180 miles but if it could do those with a single charging stop with reasonable flexibility that would be okit only really needs to seat two adults but i want to be able to get a bicycle in the back with the rear seats downmy current petrol sensible car could probably sell for approximately 15k so if i can find an ev for that much it would be a straight swap on value but hopefully save quite a bit on running costs and and get to enjoy the smoothness and linear response of an ev and its convenience on shorter trips plus trimming my carbon footprintrange performance handling ride comfort and convenience of charging are all factors although i appreciate obviously the budget means there will be compromisesim not absolutely going to do this right away but im actively considering making the switch sometime this yearmy current shortlist isnissan leaf mk2 unfortunately the 62kwh e versions seem mostly above this mark and the 40kwh seem a little short on range but worth considering hired one for a day and it was decent apart from chargingrenault zoe 50kwh good range unsure how they shape up in other wayspeugeot e208vauxhall corsa e a less fashionable 208mg5 probably not but a contender on paperhyundai ioniq 38kwh this is a bit interesting because it has a smaller battery but apparently gets really good efficiency even on the motorway ive seen 170 miles at 70mph quoted it would also have a couple of years warranty remainingive mostly ruled outbmw i3 even the 42kwh doesnt seem to give that good rangevw egolf poor rangekia soul ioniq is better merc bclass far too short rangeseat mii poor rangeany thoughts on the merits of my contenders any car ive ruled out i should reconsider and any other options ive not thought of
,PistonHeads,ive been making some videos recently where i review whats on the used market for a particular model i wont link to them so as not to fall foul of the rules but some of the feedback from owners in the comments is pretty interestingthe hyundai ioniq brought forward a fair bit of discussion around whether youre actually better off with the 28kwh model over the 38 it has greatly superior charging performance so although itll go less far you can actually go point to point faster if you need multiple charging stops most people seem extremely happy with them too both 28 and 38 owners ive never known a car to have such unilaterally positive feedback
,PistonHeads,thanks all for the info toaster ive been making some videos recently where i review whats on the used market for a particular model i wont link to them so as not to fall foul of the rules but some of the feedback from owners in the comments is pretty interestingthe hyundai ioniq brought forward a fair bit of discussion around whether youre actually better off with the 28kwh model over the 38 it has greatly superior charging performance so although itll go less far you can actually go point to point faster if you need multiple charging stops most people seem extremely happy with them too both 28 and 38 owners ive never known a car to have such unilaterally positive feedbackthanks funnily enough i found a helpful video on yt just now i wouldnt expect to be making trips long enough to need more than 1 stop so probably the larger initial range of the 38kwh would be id still go for the i3 if you have the ability to charge at home and other cars then range wont be the bugbear you think it will be noted ill put that back on the shortlistmy concerns are a range public charging on the occasional longer trip esp in winter b possible expensive issues although a 2019on car might be better sorted and c it generally seems intended as a city car which isnt how i would use ithowever the i3 probably has the best wife acceptability factor of the possible options at this price point
,PistonHeads,as an old fart petrol head i have bought an electric car 3 months ago its our only car and i will have range issues with it in the winter i do a regular 70 mile there and back and i know ill have to charge to get home when it gets colderits white goods really i have swapped a flat 6 burbly load lugger with high running costs and a fair bit of punch for a serene box with limited load space and very low operating costs my bike or the wifes wheelchair fits but the rear seats are easy to foldi now derive pleasure from tech the quality of the sound system and in real terms its quite bit quicker than the petrol wagon was i do a low mileage and most of my charging is done at home utilising a clever charging point to extract as much from the solar panels as possiblea few weeks ago i did a series of 200 miles trips needing to charge to get home 4 of the trips were magic and no problem we had to wait whilst charging for 40 mins at one point but my brother and i watched a video about the tsr2 so the time flew by the 5th trip was a nucking fightmare with unresponsive chargers stupid payment systems credit card blocking etc etc but ive learnt from that and it wont happen againplus points for me are that it fits my lifestyle to charge mostly at home so its very cheap motoring we live in a small village and its great on rural roads it can do stupid quick overtakes and on open roads it flows down the road very well its a very pleasant place to be in great seats for medium sized people i no longer feel im harming the car to fire it up for a 12 mile journey no issue with cold engineve points the car corners well but the handling is not so smooth despite its clever construction because of its relatively tall theres a real consideration of weight transfer in direction changes using the throttle to adjust direction is not smooth applying power can be a bit sudden and lifting off needs to be done with caution as the regen will really unsettle it in mid corner in consideration for passengers i usually use ecopro mode as the throttle response is softer im glad i bought the i3s its basically a great fun box its major drawback is the limited range but for us thats not much of a problem because it fits our lifestyle

,PistonHeads,id go i3 too its probably the best car ive ever owned and in my mind a modern day version of the mini great fun to drive with unrivalled details such as suicide doors and the carbon fibre shell very nippy too and still look brilliant will definitely get another now youre just being silly an i3 could never be a modern mini
,PistonHeads,id go i3 too its probably the best car ive ever owned and in my mind a modern day version of the mini great fun to drive with unrivalled details such as suicide doors and the carbon fibre shell very nippy too and still look brilliant will definitely get another now youre just being silly an i3 could never be a modern mini why not the mini heralded the era of fwd unusual hydrolastic suspension in a very compact design it could be argued that bmw has created a similar concept for the ev era
,PistonHeads,with all these cheaper cars id suggest looking at the age of them and how the battery is going to perform over the next n yearsis it better to get a newer ev which has more years before the battery starts to seriously decline or an older example of a better carhow quickly will your 15k car lose 5k or more if your needs are modest why not buy a 10k ev and lose less cashwhen people say what car for x the question is to last you for how longthe capital input is only one part of the equation another significant part is how you write down that value over time and mileagewhats your comfort zone for depreciationwhat cars are now 2025k cars which in a years time might be 15k cars making yours look a bit sickthe market is a right funny placemaybe its worth considering some phevs on the basis that theyll still be viable transport however short the battery range gets15k looks like a modestly cheap car but its expensive motoring if it swiftly becomes a 5k carotoh if it loses a lot of value on paper but you dont sell it for many years you have a different view from someone who needs to trade it in after a short timehow long can you lease an mg for 15k it might be worth doing the maths from all angles before dismissing that
,PistonHeads,500e 24kwh too limited 42kwh starts from 17k it seems although agree a good contender if i stretch the budgetthe van is certainly a possibility id not considered however i think a mk2 leaf with the same drivetrain would be more appealing as i dont need that much spaceif you were looking to resurrect the mini specifically i dont think youd come up with the i3 however i do see the similarity in it being a cleansheet small car with no preconceptions so its arguably a comparably bold and farreaching small car in 2013 as the mini was in 1959depreciation is a good point im initially thinking in terms of a 2 year ownershipit looks like the median asking price of a 2020 ioniq is 15400 while a 2018 model is 13200 with the smaller battery so 2200 depreciation over two yearsevs have recently come down quite a lot in value to me this decreases the chance that there will be further big falls in future beyond normal depreciation i think a cheap ev with a halfdecent range 150 miles more or less will still be reasonably valued into the futurein terms of battery degradation im aware of the issues the leaf has at least the mk1 otherwise batteries seem to be holding up well and if anything the rate of decline seems to reduce over time rather than falling off a cliff however this is just from a bit of quick googlingthe only phev id be interested in is the note epower because that has fully electric drive but generally the extra maintenance of an ice puts me offtaycan ive decided to invest the major part of my motoring budget in the fun car since that way it brings me most enjoyment and fun cars dont depreciate as sharply hence looking for a budget ev rather than something that will be shedding ten grand a year
,PistonHeads,looking at a two year ownership i tend to view depreciation as also including buyerseller margin so maybe youll buy at 15k and have a retail value of 13k after 2 years and get 11k trade inwhere i am its not easy to sell stuff privately so it becomes a game of tradein wbac ebay or not worrying about best price after two yearstaking a shedonomics view it can be better to pay a little more and write the car down to zero over an extra year or twothe optimum time to change cars is more easily seen in hindsightlooking at evs on autotarder sellers are often strangely reluctant to provide a picture of the dash showing car is fully charged and the puter says its got n miles range how hard can it be
,PistonHeads,if its a lease dont worry about it just charge in whatever way works for you
,PistonHeads,i have installed a home charger in the same scenario as you describe without having to upgrade the 100a fuse mine was done by pod point and it has load balancing which varies the power to avoid tripping the main fuse maybe they are a better option jaguar recommend both pod point and chargemaster i opted for the latter for reasons that escape me nowyour electricity bill will rocket i often get up the morning and ive already used over 100 kwh overnight
,PistonHeads,please forgive me for hijacking this thread with a sort of relevant question as i have been pondering whenhow i will switch to an electric car i regularly only do 12 miles a day and maybe 40 miles at the weekend not a lot i know and the odd long distance ish trip of maybe 100 miles once a month but i want a nice car to do it in so have been considering a lease on an ipacenow its a lease so this shouldnt really matter to me but whats good for the batterythe scenarios as i see them1 get home every night plug it in to a 13amp wall socket and top it up over night2 let it run down a little bit more and maybe plug it in to the 13amp wall socket every other night or where ever the sweet spot is of gaining 100 battery to start the day after a charge meaning should one of those longer trips come up no planning required just plug it in the night before3 let it run all the way down and then just charge over night every night till it gets full and then rinse and repeat4 get a 7kw home charger and then use it like a petrol station whenever i need itso to refine the questiondoes it matter how you charge the battery for battery lifelongevitymaximum capacity at home in a low mileage situation or is there some fancy software dealing with it so i dont worry and all i have to think about is not rapid charging it too many times in a rowi dont know how many miles the op does but i would have assumed getting a home charger was the right thing to do irrespective of miles to look after the battery but then some posters are saying about granny charging and if that is acceptable am i over thinking it the change is easier than i think and it might be for the op as well if they are only doing low miles and just embracing what may be the future people do it but its not recommended to granny charge permanently if you can get a home charger fitted itll be more efficient and safer and obviously fasterref battery charge keeping it between 20 and 80 most of the time is generally considered best for longevity i charge to 80 most nights unless i know ill need the extra the next dayedited by danp on monday 24th february 1828

,PistonHeads,we have an eniro on order but if i cant get a 7kw charger well be reconsidering likewise if the ev grant is stopped thatll end the idea given the cost of such a car are you really saying that not getting 500 off a charger would put you off buying an ev completely

,PistonHeads,if you charge for 12 hours every night on a granny charger that is 12 hours 9 miles 7 800 miles a week or 40k a year 90 of people would be fine with a granny charger if you are in the 10 please dont shout at me
,PistonHeads,if you charge for 12 hours every night on a granny charger that is 12 hours 9 miles 7 800 miles a week or 40k a year 90 of people would be fine with a granny charger if you are in the 10 please dont shout at me exactly i can understand getting a dedicated charger from a convenience standpoint but its hardly an absolute necessity for most
,PistonHeads,we have an eniro on order but if i cant get a 7kw charger well be reconsidering likewise if the ev grant is stopped thatll end the idea given the cost of such a car are you really saying that not getting 500 off a charger would put you off buying an ev completelyi assume he means the 3500 grant on the car rather than the grant to install the charger if hes got the order done then the dealer should have already applied for his grant so he hasnt really got to worry about that
,PistonHeads,exactly i can understand getting a dedicated charger from a convenience standpoint but its hardly an absolute necessity for mosti would argue that from a practical standpoint it is necessary to have a 7kw for an ipace it means that whatever your state of charge you can charge to full overnight i do about 10k miles pa in my ipace and i frequently need to do a big charge overnight plus it means i can do the vast majority of my charging overnight on e7 rates which probably saves approx 200 per year compared to charging throughout the day on a granny charger
,PistonHeads,people do it but its not recommended to granny charge permanently if you can get a home charger fitted itll be more efficient and safer and obviously fasterref battery charge keeping it between 20 and 80 most of the time is generally considered best for longevity i charge to 80 most nights unless i know ill need the extra the next dayedited by danp on monday 24th february 1828 you dont need to do this with the ipace and in fact there is no feature to allow you to charge only up to 80
,PistonHeads,i guess the big part for me is this is an experiment before i need to and i quite like the idea of an electric car as a daily but it seems that the technology to charge is changingadvancing at the moment with many different sorts the taycan has a new system which means something and is supposedly better but say i get a home charger for an ipace on a 2 year lease then buy in to the electric car premise and get something for myself will i have to change the chargerthe advances in charging are on the rapid charging side putting lots of electricity in as quickly as possible while on a journey its not something youd have at home home charging is limited by supply to your house and spare capacity after your other electrical stuff so the vast majority will be using 7kw single phase ac its good enough for putting 2025 miles of range per hour into the car depending on how efficiently your car uses it so enough to fill most cars overnight easily if you have 3 phase at home and a capable charger in the car then you can get a bit faster but not worth doing just for car charging fit a 7kw charger now and itll be fine for the future
,PistonHeads,the solution here is to buy a car that can be charged from empty to fill in under 5 minutes at a petrol station rewiring a house for the purpose ofincreasing electricity bills is a very expensive undertaking

,PistonHeads,paul this thread is music to my earsim hoping to buy a used i3s in a couple of monthsi did some research by looking up the webuyanycar offers on some advertised cars and the prices are so far apart it just means that theres no trade buyers right now so there are a few dealers with vexpensive stock do some dealers still have 100day limitsi have done this for years and ive done the same as you in fact years ago before bca bought wbac i used to go to auctions and check what may be worth buying id then punch the details into wbac and see how far i should bid up to on a number of occasions i bought a car i didnt need because it was so cheap and then took it to wbac as soon as the v5 had come through i was annoyed when bca bought wbac as it knackered that little systemhowever i digress i too have noticed a significant gap between what wbac had valued around christmas compared to the last couple of weeks in cases we are talking in excess of 30k less than screen price ok so im looking at 100k plus cars buta few months ago the gap was around 510k less

,PistonHeads,used car prices wont be resolved until the electricity prices get sorted as the average used car is buying is a much different beast to a new car buyernot sure thats true the average used suv costs 25k i would argue that youre likely no worse off financially with 25k to splash on a car compared to someone whos using a salary sacrificeleasing scheme even if these people have an extra 1015k to spend theyre also probably thinking a used ev as current prices doesnt quite stack up i also appreciate that evs canwill outlast an ice but i would be interested to know the current first ownership tenure have we just encouraged people to buy and replace more often than before i would guess that evs have significantly increased the uptake of new car purchases these cars are now being replaced more frequently seems a little counter productive although im happy to capitalise on lower used prices edited by jamsxr on wednesday 15th february 1349

,PistonHeads,vw golf mki cabrio was sold alongside the mkii hatchback for a number of yearsand the mk1 saloon carried on as the citigolf in south africa until very recentlyim always confused by the timeline of the punto punto evo and grande punto there must have been overlaps and differences somewhere along the line especially if you consider the 500l or 500x a replacement
,PistonHeads,maybe not 100 but fiat is selling the old 500 alongside the new 500ethey also sold the mk2 punto alongside the mk3 for 5 years at least in italy
,PistonHeads,wasnt the p6 in production til 1977after the introduction of the sd1 in 1976also i think the tr3b for us markets overlapped with tr4 launchkeeping with the triumph theme i think the us market also kept selling the tr4 solid axle alongside the tr4 irs model because the dealers demanded itthe herald 1200 sold alongside the revised herald 1360 for a while and wasnt the triumph 1300 saloon supposed to replace the herald but again both ran side by side for a while
,PistonHeads,keeping with the triumph theme i think the us market also kept selling the tr4 solid axle alongside the tr4 irs model because the dealers demanded itthe herald 1200 sold alongside the revised herald 1360 for a while and wasnt the triumph 1300 saloon supposed to replace the herald but again both ran side by side for a while there were a lot of these strange overlaps in the confusion that was bmcbl the older farina cars significantly overlapped the various maxi models and morris minors overlapped the 11001300 rangeid say that neither of these really count for the tr4 and herald these are more like options and spec trim levels irs on the tr4a was a costoption in the us market but those cars still had all the other minor cosmetic interior and mechanical upgrades that the standard tr4 had similarly the herald 1200 remained as a lower cost lowerspec alternative to the 1360 but they were still fundamentally the same car the triumph 1300 started out in development as a successor to the herald but long before production began triumph realised they couldnt sell it at anything like the heralds price so slotted it into the range between the herald and the 2000 to compete against the bmc ado16 it wasnt really the new generation being sold alongside the old one same went for the austin metro which was developed to entirely replace the mini but late in development was pushed slightly upmarket and the mechanical improvements cascaded down to the mini so the latter could stay in production as the bottomprice economy entry to bls range but its not really right to say the 1300 or the metro ever made it onto the showroom floor intended as replacements for their older counterparts same with foss62s bmc examples although common sense would suggest that the maxi should have replaced the farinab models and the ado16 should have replaced the minor that was never the intention so not a case of old sold alongside new the fwd cars were expansions of the range not developments of it im also not sure id really class the for instance mercedes or bmw habit of phasing in model variants on a new generation as quite the same thing bmw had every intention of the e36 fully replacing the e30 but spread the costs across a few years by having the estate models run slightly out of step with the main rangei think the clearcut examples are ones like the range rover p38range rover classic where two distinct generations of the same model sold squarely alongside each other with the older version priced and pitched slightly lower than its replacement or the renault campus models where the r5 campus existed as a onemodel bargain basement option alongside the clio and the secondgen clio stayed on as the clio campus alongside the thirdgen see also fords habit in the 50s and 60s of stripping back the outgoing anglia model and selling it alongside the new one as a popular
,PistonHeads,volvo still had the 200 series with the 700 series wikipedia even seems to suggest in 1991 the 800 series was also in production and maybe even an 900 seriessad considering you cant even buy one volvo estate these days
,PistonHeads,audi ur quattrothe last original audi quattro was produced on 17 may 1991 more than two years after the first models of the new audi coupé range based on the 1986 audi 80 had been introducedbeing strict about this the s2 replaced the original quattro in 1991 however there are instances of both being on sale at the same time if not in production

,PistonHeads,just had this delivered charger of ones choice is secreted within base not picturedit lights up and everything
,PistonHeads,gentle bump on the aboveim a long way out of my depth herei went for a zappi its tethered and works well with solar and the reviews are good not cheap 1300 fitted but im happy with it hasnt let me down once and the interface with the app is clear and easy to use mine is indoors so appearance wasnt an issue its not the prettiest and certainly not the cheapest hth
,PistonHeads,thank youthe scheduling point is something i hadnt thought of we have e7 electricity so this would be a smart movescheduling is usually best done on the car wherever possible this is because if you plug the car in and lock it without it being able to charge it can go to sleep and not wake up when the charger does then it wont charge scheduling it via the car avoids this

,PistonHeads,i have an ics charger with id4 i use the ids app to schedule charging no problems in 18 months i have had it the charger came with 2 rfid cards which i think can be used to give other people access to your charger and track how much of your electricity they use but i have never used this function just plug the car in set schedule on ics app and get 30 kwh of octopus go cheap power overnight

,PistonHeads,after three years the current model on sale then will have superior tech the batteries of the three year old one will be about a third of their journey into the total unknown and the cost of replacing them will still be 47m and a ride on your grannylets debunk this now not personal to you da its just your comment encapsulated a few on this thread and in othersice car engines fail shortly out of warranty and at fourfigure costs to replace the engine however that is very rare in the same way catastrophic battery failure has been known to happen but in very small numbers and the level of risk is broadly similar to that of buying a three year old ice and being billed for a new enginealso in many cases individual battery cells can be replaced rather than the whole lot try buying half an engine blockwhats interesting is the persisting nature of this concern expressed by da and others about better fault when we have a generation of liquidcooled battery cars like zoes and tesla model ss that have done intergalactic mileages without complaint public perception remains like this despite the fact those early fears have been disproven or at least shown to be equivalent or better than the risk of catastrophic ice failurethe relatively large numbers of early nissan leafs with inferior air cooled batteries that degraded badly havent helped with perception but its more than that when battery powered vehicles fail it seems to induce a collective response that outstrips the actual probabilities involved its similar for vehicle fires everyone loves a news story about battery fires but your neighbours diesel astra is more likely to combust than an electric cari wonder if there were similar conversations when cars began to replace horsedrawn vehicles until the public become more familiar and comfortable with the tech its going to take a lot of gentle persuasion and pr to overcome the visceral reaction of many who hold concernseven when evs reach toyota corolla levels of reliability managing the perception will still really matteryup but it is for the very reasons you state that the consumer currently applies that part of the discount evs have only been selling in any number for a few years and it will be years yet before a general understanding of the durability of that battery chemistry filters through but then that understanding wont be relevant to the newt cell chemistry uncertainty equals discounted perception of value plus one can also consider the actual consumer demographic of the used ev buyer they have money because they have driveways theyre educated because they arent terrified of the new or angry over change but at the same time they dont want new its a picture painted of consumers who have money but no interest in just lobbing it about on any old crap in other words the worst punters to try and flog stuff to as they arent going to be easy to hype up into a buying frenzy which is exactly why manufacturers have failed to manipulate used values in their favour and there is actually some form of free market in used ev prices long may that continue

,PistonHeads,i always hoped that the move to evs would result in lower cars as there no longer were a need for hig bonett to clear the engine but instead it seems to have resulted in more and more cars morphing into having cuvlike proportions like here or with the id7 i think it is a shameprobably more of a pedestrian safety than a packaging thing i think thats why the gr86 is heading off so soon

,PistonHeads,so with my first ev a bmw i3 i charged to 100 for every work day and used it down to 2 every day when the range extender would kick ini sold it at 60k miles and had not noticed and drop in rangei would charge to 100 my second an i3s every other day and again taki down to very low charge levelsi only did about 11k miles in that so again not noticeable changenot commuting anymore so my ionoq 5 gets charged to various levels with no real targetthe exception is only if i need to make a long business or leasure trip in which case 100edited by so called on wednesday 12th october 1503 but the i3 is one of those with a bms that doesnt let you charge above about 80 and go below about 5 so when it shows 100 charge on the display that is only 80 in reality yes i didnt realize that for about 6 months and it was because of threads like this that i investigatedwhich is part of the ops questionhow do people know if the car is set up this wayi dont actually know on my ioniq 5 edited by so called on wednesday 12th october 1540
,PistonHeads,im awaiting delivery of my first ev but its a lease vehicle so while my inherent mechanical sympathy means i dont want to hammer the battery im unlikely to suffer the consequencesa question about charging to 100 though i know that charging isnt 11 and that to charge 10 kwh to the battery might add 11 kwh to my electricity bill but is this inefficiency linear or does it get worse trying to squeeze the last few electrons into a full batteryis there a selfish motive to not fully charging when not needed because cycling between 20 and 50 every day equates to lower bills over a year than routinely cycling between 70 and 100 instead

,PistonHeads,one other thing which may not be the same with all cars mine is fairly rubbish on consumption for the first 10 as i believe it doesnt use the regeneration breaking till 90it doesnt really bother me but something to possibly think about if you are trying to count the pennies

,PistonHeads,if youre planning on keeping a car forever then maybe think about battery management if youre going to keep it between three and five years dont bother as it makes very little difference you have to be doing huge milage in the life of the car150000for battery management to make any real difference data shows at 150000 miles of a tesla battery you may lose 5 of range this guy gets it
,PistonHeads,i do not run an ev but i am thinking of getting onemy mileage is low i have a driveway i have solar power charging is never going to be an issuemy ev is likely to sit for a few days without being used i do wonder if there is any issue with using the battery to its max capacity or does the battery management system take care of itwhy is there a difference between actual battery size and usable sizeare some evs battery management better than others if so in what wayand for those advocating not using 100 every time or leaving it fully charged or leaving it at vlow chargewhere does your info come from
,PistonHeads,paul i and for those advocating not using 100 every time or leaving it fully charged or leaving it at vlow chargewhere does your info come frommost makers of all the various lithium cells tend to advocate not leaving a cell at zero charge or close to zero for any length of timemany advocate not charging to 100 for long or medium term storage although the bms may sort that anywaythere is a vague consensus that 75 or 80 is optimumbut since superficially similar cars can have different cells and different bmss i think a bit of rtfm wont hurtbut dont forget to look after the 12v battery that does the tedious stuff like unlocking the car
,PistonHeads,paul and for those advocating not using 100 every time or leaving it fully charged or leaving it at vlow chargewhere does your info come fromthe internet google it a bit and its fairly common knowledge that the manufacturers are holding back some capacity to give headroom for cell cycling were told we should all cycle the battery in our smart phones to avoid degradation occurring too rapidly hardly any of us actually do it of course but it works and has a positive effectall evs have a bms some will be better than others but they all seek to manage the charge and discharge rate of the cells in an optimal fashion to extend their lives its not just the extra 510 headroom some evs are known to have i suspect virtually all will have headroom but not all are the focus of much interest so its hard to get info the bms can also charge and discharge cells on the fly whilst in use via regen it just has to keep track of the charge state and usage of each cluster of cells and it can treat them as kindly as possibleheres some interesting reading httpswwwtheglobeandmailcomdrivemobilityarti do wonder why some car manufacturers and experts are saying that charging to 100 makes no appreciable difference as in the link above whereas others say only to do so ahead of a long trip i can only imagine that its because it doesnt inconvenience them one bit if their customers only charge to 80 so they might as well encourage it if it makes only the tiniest positive difference in terms of battery life residual values of their products and might even save a few battery warranty claims thats all i can think of but as an owner ill charge to 100 anytime i think theres even a possibility i might need all the range because not doing so could inconvenience mebut anyway real world evidence shows endless old teslas that have been rapid charged their entire life probably often to 100 as rapid charging is fast and more importantly free for the earlier cars so i imagine most owners fill their boots and take all the free power they can cram into their car whenever they do need to top up some of these cars are approaching 200k miles now and are a decade old
,PistonHeads,35 years into our egolf ownership i charge it 4 nights a week for the wifes commute and then sometimes at the weekend depending what we are doing i have never charged to anything less that 100 dont even know where the setting is always charged at home not noticed a single mile of range reduced in that time still will show 160 on a good day prior to that we had a fiat 500e exactly the same 100 charge never saw a drop in range over 3 years
,PistonHeads,i imagine that hybrids and phevs are generating a lot of data because they have smaller batteries and thus cycle them more often as well as running at higher power relative to the battery sizehybrids are also more controlled by the software the user has less control over charge and dischargefor some reason people dont discuss hybrids very much plugin or otherwise people who drive them seem to just say we like it works for uspartly i suspect because discussing their economy or battery range is so use case dependent

,PistonHeads,data shows at 150000 miles of a tesla battery you may lose 5 of range at 57k miles our tesla battery is at 67 degredation its also now clear every single tesla pack made before 201415 is guaranteed to fail before the working life of the car though the issue is to do with poor contactor design than degredation tesla also software capped all older cars with slower charging rates and lower usable battery capacity to reduce their warranty exposuremodel 3 battery degredation is looking to be around 8 at 100k milesthere are some used evs around with horrific battery degredation 20

,PistonHeads,id have one of these in a heartbeat the boxy exterior is glorious and the interior to my eyes at least is wonderful too its a dramatic illustration as well of how much cars have developed in the last few years as 200hp is now run of the mill but now with 40 mpg easily possible remarkable
,PistonHeads,the mad when i was quite young my parents explained to me what are called the facts of life when they had finished my to me one more thing if you see a car that you like and it has an alfaromeo badge on the front look at it admire it but do not buy ithis advice has stood me in good stead over the yearsthat was probably sensible from a prejudiced stance and then you missed out on the essense of what makes a car utterly compelling as a fun all immersive driving experience a bmw for example simply would not come close to offering the same level of excitement and pleasure of driving having owned three alfas my personal experience has been that none of them from 1975 gtv 155 twinspark and the 147 gta caused me any real trouble compared to my bmw 3 series which was not only a bore to drive but had more mechanical problems
,PistonHeads,i guess its a sign of my age but i really struggle to find value in cars like this i have always admired them but was never seriously interested at the 25k that good low milers used to be for years and years so 48k for a leggy one just doesnt appeal same goes for other late 20th century rarities i have bought and sold a few when values were much lower so paying 2 3 or even 4 times the price for the same experience nowadays is hard for me to justifyglad they exist and others are happy to pay these prices and maintain the cars for future generations though
,PistonHeads,ill have one of these and a 75 turbo evoluzione in my fantasy italian garage please ive been fascinated by the sz ever since it was first released and won rave reviews by quite a few journos for the driving experience
,PistonHeads,i cant decide if i like it or not theyre a very odd slightly awkward looking carive never liked the way it looks to be fair it looks like a 5 year old has designed itim not sure if that was deliberatethe plan by alfa though being left hand drive was always going to limit its appeal in the uk as well i thinkalthough my dad had a lhd 50 mustang for 10 years mostly without issuehe did moan about struggling to see that easily when overtaking stuff in it
,PistonHeads,stunning loved these ever since seeing them in the old amiga game supercars i didnt realise they were actually a real car until later and ive been smitten since theni very nearly bought one but went for a qf instead as i needed something i could drive every day that only lasted a monthi think i read on here that they share the same headlights as an f40 theres a pheader on here called jamie who has an rz i hope he pops up with some thoughts
,PistonHeads,i remember these when they came out and think ive only ever seen one on the road my thoughts were wow now i look at them and think vile
,PistonHeads,the mad when i was quite young my parents explained to me what are called the facts of life when they had finished my to me one more thing if you see a car that you like and it has an alfaromeo badge on the front look at it admire it but do not buy ithis advice has stood me in good stead over the yearsthat was probably sensible from a prejudiced stance and then you missed out on the essense of what makes a car utterly compelling as a fun all immersive driving experience a bmw for example simply would not come close to offering the same level of excitement and pleasure of driving having owned three alfas my personal experience has been that none of them from 1975 gtv 155 twinspark and the 147 gta caused me any real trouble compared to my bmw 3 series which was not only a bore to drive but had more mechanical problems ive had modern era bmw mercedes audipeugeot ford vauxhall hondamitsubishi subaru i now have alfa romeo nowhere near the most unreliable car ive ever had audi a5 by a mile if you are wondering
,PistonHeads,can i ask about ss and higher earners additional benefit i understand that between 100k and 125k of earnings for every 2 over 100k 1 is lost from personal allowance until the point that 125k allowance is fully eroded at 125k or there abouts when the personal allowance is lost you pay 20 on the 125k so 25k to pay in additional tax at 125kso if quoted a car that is net 500mnth upto 100k tusker not providing a net sum for sums above 100k at 125k is the sum as easy as the net amount of 500 mnth less 250012 208 so the actual net cost of car could to be 292mnth or have i got it wrongedited by durhamlandy1 on thursday 15th february 2232 my understanding is the easiest way to work out the net cost is take 62 from the monthly gross reduction quoted on the tusker quote summary and then add the bik this gives you the actual effect on take home paythats what i didthey typically show the net amount at 40 and 45 percentbut it is a higher rate in the 100125 rate equivalent of 62 per cent so use that1000 gross is equiv of 380 and then the bik to add to thati also assumed the cost of insurance and took that off as well to get the hire cost of the car
,PistonHeads,just make your own calculator take the gross amount and bang off 60 tax ni and whatever if any ni saving your employer passes on then plus bik
,PistonHeads,new to this thread apologies if this has been covered somewhere before but not time to go through all 68 pageshas anyone done a personal business lease then ss without going through one of the many expensive it seems schemes we are a small business just looking at one or two cars possibly dont need the extras that some seem to charge so i dont see why we cant lease direct from any lease company at a better rate then just do the adjustments on paye like we do with pension am i missing something unfortunately most info online seems to be from companies offering schemes which doesnt helpits worth checking out drive electric they offer a salary sacrifice scheme that compares very well to octopus and tusker and you can tailor the scheme to take only the bits you need things like early termination insurance can be droppedhttpswwwdriveelectriccoukbusinessservices

,PistonHeads,i had our new mercedes eqb delivered this week really happy with it considering id never seen sat in or driven one the man maths stacked up to get into something new when id scraped through winter in a damp frosted up 2005 seat leon usually with a dead battery when i had to pick up my daughter from after school club went for the 350 and it does haul its self around quickly for a 7 seater bus not particularly engaging though after the initial punch its effortlessly cruising along and theres not much to do no gears to change which is something that has taken a bit of time to get used towaiting to see the first pay cheque to make sure its not a scam

2023-01-31,PistonHeads,theres over 100 honda e on autotrader and the cheapest is a 20 reg at 24k with its size and low range theyd need to be good because there are plenty of alternatives such as nissan leaf vw egolf and up and fiat 500e some even newer for under 20kyes those prices are still very high lots of dealers living in lala land with 30k listings
2023-01-31,PistonHeads,the honda e is an urban car not a mile muncher it works best in cities towns conurbations hence it has a small light batterynot for everyone but will work for some usage patterns casesedited by dobly on wednesday 1st february 0530
2023-01-31,PistonHeads,the honda e is an urban car not a mile muncher it works best in cities towns conurbations hence it has a small light batterynot for everyone but will work for some usage patternsyeah true when i was leasing a cheap 24kwh leaf as a third car for a city runabout it worked great for that reason but i think now the hondae is too expensive for its range which is presumably why honda are no longer making them i mean apart from the looks it would be far more sensible to leasebuy a cheap zoe which has nearly twice the battery size and works as both a city runabout and a normal car
2023-02-01,PistonHeads,honda are no longer making themas far as i can tell from honda japan they are still manufacturing the e their website quotes a 1 month lead time from order to delivery at presenthmmm im now not sureim sure i saw an article last year it was no longer in production looking on google the evdatabase says it is also out of production but as you say it is still available to order on the honda website but is that just old stock they are waiting to clear however that would also be a very short period of time for a major manufacturer to stop production so maybe that information from last year is wrong and the car is still being produced httpsevdatabaseorgukcar1171hondae
2023-02-01,PistonHeads,our e has been showing 70 odd miles of range but in the summer it was way over 100with us planning on using it to tow the caravan to botswana next summer this may be a problem oh hang onit is what it is a slightly silly citysecondcar ev makes no financial sense buying one if you just want an ev brilliant funky design suspension designed by someone who cared and expensive because of it comes with michelin ps4 from factory range is secondary to the widgets and screens and clever lights and retro feel brown seatbelts cant be cheap eitherit rattles occasionally and i worry about getting the blue paint fixed if it ever gets damaged but other than that its a fun ev to own and rare too it seems to be a conversation starter people are quite enthusiastic about it even more so when you show them the fish tank renault zoe would be the choice for the range anxious if youve only got one car but its boooooring we had a 24kw leaf and that was fine we had a 27kw soul and that was fine too pain in the arse started with trying to be too smart buying a tesla and thinking we could do long distances in it
2023-02-01,PistonHeads,its a very cult car concept and one that i thought would go down well in japan bmw are moving away from the i3 in favour of more bland main stream and i guess honda will do the samethe design isnt the problem with the e its the rangebattery sizeprice if it does get killed off or replaced with a plain looking ejazz it would be a shame but an ejazz would probably sell in the numbers they want for the ethat would be a jazze funkyinteresting cars dont sell and longer range is an issue for all the small evs

,PistonHeads,terrible news but thats not the end of it theres a big fuel duty hole in the budget if according to the government 50 of cars will be electric by 2025 i very much doubt that then wheres the loss of fuel duty coming fromwere all about to be priced out of ice vehicles electric will cost the same roughly as current ice but it does come with massive disadvantages in terms of convenience infrastructure electricity costs that continue to rise and so on its not the solution for everyone
,PistonHeads,its a nasty precedent this retrospection of ved justified by a need for electric vehicle revenue to ramp up with their increased use that section may get amended of course before getting into law my concern here is that the 0 i pay for my 47yearold car will come to an end but unlikely there arent that many 40year old cars on the road relatively
,PistonHeads,its a nasty precedent this retrospection of ved justified by a need for electric vehicle revenue to ramp up with their increased use that section may get amended of course before getting into law my concern here is that the 0 i pay for my 47yearold car will come to an end but unlikely there arent that many 40year old cars on the road relativelysimilar to what i in the news thread precedent is there now to for example introduce an ice surcharge for all ice cars old and new alike
,PistonHeads,its only fair they use the same roads and you had to expect that once they started to become popular government would raid your coffers for tax it is what governments in this country do the simple fact is that normal cars users will eventually be taxed off the road or blackmailed by tax onto public transport the road tax revenue has to be replaced somehow
,PistonHeads,silent terrible news but thats not the end of it theres a big fuel duty hole in the budget if according to the government 50 of cars will be electric by 2025 i very much doubt that then wheres the loss of fuel duty coming fromwere all about to be priced out of ice vehicles electric will cost the same roughly as current ice but it does come with massive disadvantages in terms of convenience infrastructure electricity costs that continue to rise and so on its not the solution for everyone
,PistonHeads,well that ped on my chips ive that changes are never made retrospectively they usually arent when the huge jump in ved for vehicles over 225gkm emissions was announced on budget day 2006 it only applied from that day 260306 but here cars registered between april 2017 and 2025 that are currently 0 due to being zero emission will become standard rate currently 165 pa from 2001 to 2017 they become 20 pa which seems miniscule in the scheme of things not just the amount but because there are very few pre 2017 zeroemission cars relatively all those electric vehicles over 40k list will be paying a lot of ved for 5 years they can afford it edited to add us motorcyclists get a raw deal again i have to pay 101 for a 600cc bike already and if i go electric it will be 22 per year from 2025 so a 125cc stinky one will be the same commercial electrics get a right clobbering up to 290 paedited by sixor8 on thursday 17th november 1340 but it says cars in band a which pay 0 will move into band b and pay 20 this will effect all of the 99gkm diesels as well as the electric zero emitters so probably a decent amount of vehicles
,PistonHeads,silent terrible news but thats not the end of it theres a big fuel duty hole in the budget if according to the government 50 of cars will be electric by 2025 i very much doubt that then wheres the loss of fuel duty coming fromi would imagine they mean 50 of new car sales which sounds just optimistic but just about plausible not 50 of cars on the road which sounds impossible if 50 of new cars are ev by 2025 80 of cars on the road will still be ice at that point but yes im sure theyre already thinking about the best mechanism to recoup the loss of fuel duty
,PistonHeads,i genuinely cant see the retrospectively applied ved working without also increasing the ved on ice which qualified for 0 and 30 ved years ago and includes my phev but to increase that ves rate will hit the people at the very bottom of the second hand car markettruly bizarre retrospective policy
,PistonHeads,so the wifes fiat 500e will go from zero to 165year but my sons old megane diesel will go up from zero to 20year yeah seems fair
,PistonHeads,so the wifes fiat 500e will go from zero to 165year but my sons old megane diesel will go up from zero to 20year yeah seems fair i dont think anything ice will be less than 165 per year come 2025 lots of budgets between then and now
,PistonHeads,i run an electric car but would think twice about buying another getting expensive to charge if you cant do it at cheap rate at home capital cost is high and as volume increases so will depreciation no ved some of the prices being asked by manufacturers closing in on 100k are crazy was it labour 2030 never going to happen
,PistonHeads,so the wifes fiat 500e will go from zero to 165year but my sons old megane diesel will go up from zero to 20year yeah seems fair i dont think anything ice will be less than 165 per year come 2025 lots of budgets between then and nowitll be a hard sell given most of those zero ved ice will be near the bottom of the user car market
,PistonHeads,im not against electric cars but my god even with the swooshy noises they added on the video that was dull
,PistonHeads,in 10 years will a audi a3 do 060 in 35 seconds will a basic fiat 500e be doing 60 in 5 seconds etc i wonder given acceleration is a function a 1 gear high torque will firms start to limit acceleration electronicallystill want 250 miles range and a 5 min or less charge more than i want blink of an eye acceleration
,PistonHeads,it must have sticky tyres or downforce or both to achieve those figures

,PistonHeads,do any of you threadists have readers threads on your older mercsi had convinced myself i wanted an ls400 for commuting fauxmerc looks with reliability but the more i look at them the more i want an older mercedesive had a w202 and a w203 both sold on to family members but i think maybe a w124 or w123 is what i need as a daily driver for me the w202 is probably the last of the proper classic styled mercs saloons that i loveyouve had a lot of really good advice already and there is a lot of mb experience here to tap into ive had a 124 estate and a cabrio a 190 a 500 sl r129 and a 560 sec some of those cars are now owned by other threadists i have loved them all and still have a 1973 350 slc httpswwwpistonheadscomgassingtopicasph0id echo that a 123 might be a challenging daily but a 124 is very doable even now do buy carefully though they need love as they get older and buying a neglected car will cost you northbrooks thread is well worth following and youll see from r129sls threads that preventative proactive and regular maintenance is key as others buy carefully but also as 0a and others they are terrifically rewarding cars to own and drive i now daily drive and do regular long road trips in a 2002 lexus ls 430 and am a big fan but theres no doubt that driving an old mercedes offers considerably more cred than a partridgeesque fat jap on the plus side the ls gives one the coveted green digital clock and the dna link with the uberdesirable sc430

,PistonHeads,logically either the w124 e500 or the z1 both rare and exclusive and the latter is certainly fairly exoticbut actually i think the rarest in terms of total number built was the 156 gta oddly enough only about 3000 gta saloons were built 4500 if you include the sportwagen version whereas merc knocked out around 10000 w124 500ee500s and bmw managed 8000 z1s

,PistonHeads,on the leasing thread it seems a different dealer is now offering 195month with no deposit i think we are going to see this type of deal reoccur regularly as we get into the last month of each quarterand in the context of this thread someone getting a new honda ev at this price is likely to be saving near to 100month in fuel and they get free servicing too and the lower maintenance costs from running a brand new car at these types of prices for the right person who can charge at home and who doesnt do huge mileage perhaps as a second car this is going to be cheaper than running an old bangerand i was quite happy with my 270mth for the leon dsg model that was floating around a few months backperhaps i should have waited

,PistonHeads,weather has been incredible since christmas eve in some ways christmas eve was the perfect day weather wise christmas day was a bit windier but the wind subsided very early yesterday morning we did a family and friends outing to the south yesterday we planned it around the crowds and had a great time but i doubt i will be going back until the hordes have departed on jan 7th it was as busy as i have ever seen it from los cris all the way up to adeje
,PistonHeads,in the spanish rentals i have used its either pitch black or lit up like a prison the concept of dimmable lighting is yet to arrive glad to hear you are having a nice time i am thinking about hiring a 500e on tenerife to try one out as i think an electric car will be good going up the hillsin terms of hotel news the mediterranean palace refurb is still a workinprogress the rooms look almost done but the rearfebruary still remains the target for the completion and then the closure of cleopatra next door for its refurb
,PistonHeads,well i doubt you will see much of santa cruz in tenerife as the arrival day you will have spent travelling and although you have an 11pm departure it is a rare person that has the energy to get back off the ship once you have arrived especially as the tui mooring point is a fair walk from the townsimilarly on departure day they will want you off and away to the airportlas palmas in gran ganaria is pleasant get the number 12 bus from outside the cruise terminal and for just over 1 euro it will take you to the old town which is nice for a stroll around old market building big cathedral etc and as your ship doesnt leave until 11pm then it is worth an early evening stroll off the ship through the new town to the beach the other side where there are some nice nonbritish bars for a drink to watch the evening beach vollyballpuerto del rosario in fuerteventura do something anything other than staying there if the weather is good get the bus either north to corralejo or south to caleta de fuste neither are fabulous but either is a hell of a lot better than puerto del rosario even if all you are doing is going somewhere for a drink and to swim in the seaarrecife in lanzarote is slightly less grim than puerto del rosario but that isnt saying much most people seem to take a stroll around the puddle which is a small tidal area with some dinghies and with a few bars around because frankly there isnt much more to see and really unless you are hiring a car there is nothing to see on any bus routesfunchal is probably the pick of the bunch as there is quite a lot to see and do in the town without needing to venture any furtherjust back from the one week cruise and the advice was pretty spot on im already forgetting what we did fuerteventura was pretty dire especially as we were there on a windy sunday we caught the 12 at gran ganaria and wandered around as advised pretty straight forwardarrecife it was okay enough for a stroll and i dont think we were docked long enough for a car rental funchal was lovely very clean first time visiting madeira and i think wed like to return we did an excursion which included a trip on the cable car a descent on the wicker baskets and then a wander around the botanical gardens we quite enjoyed this we did an excursion at las palma too but it was overcast and windy so we didnt get to see the views we might want to visit again in the future what was very noticeable in most of the port cities was how vibrant the high streets are still not only cruise ship passengers but locals out and about with normal shops still trading a stark contrast to the boarded up uk high streets the cruise itself had a very budget feel to it id rate it as only okay if we were to go on another one maybe wed spend a little more and choose something a little more upmarket it wasnt cheap though certainly if you add all of the additional spending it was good in terms of having activities laid on that we could coerce our 12 year old daughter to participate in normally shed want to be locked up in a hotel room with a phonetabletunfortunately i seem to have returned with a coldedited by chris type r on sunday 14th april 0914
,PistonHeads,dr dr the only reason i will never own a bmw is because of how theyre typically driven you only have to watch youtube channels like uk dashcams etc to see what sort of muppetry goes on the clips where you think fuuuuuck is usually either a bmw or audi thank you you have helped me to realise that youre a moron without having to read any more of your posts i just cant get my head around how stupid someone would have to be to try and generalise about drivers of the 5th highest selling manufacturer in the uk how rude oh youre a bmw driver figures carry onwell if youre going come out with stupid statements expect people to join the dots and conclude youre an imbecile
,PistonHeads,brilliant ill be watching this thread for ages i reckon ive never been upperclass and stopped wearing white socks in the 80s so probably not a chav either but ive had bmws for the last 13 years because i like rwd drivers cars and nobody else has really done that recently my 1st car was a mk2 cortina followed by a fiat 125 rover p6b 3500s mk2 granada ghia mk2 escort rs2000 capri 28 injection cavalier sportshatch capri injection granada scorpio mercedes 280e you get the idea still my e9 daily is an e91 so as its a touring possibly not as chav but i like it so dont really care
,PistonHeads,im quite young i wear trainers and have a 4 series i acknowledge people feel that way towards me id play music quietly right not loud at all but because mine has harmon kardon you can always hear the base and its never loud but its enough to turn a head or 2 id get looked at probably judged so what do i do press sport plus slot the gearbox to the left and be sure to floor it off until i reach the speed limit allowing a small amount of wheelspin the longer the stare the more wheelspin thats just at normal places where people walk past i always get looked at in petrol stations not like im walking around with my johnson in my hand but whenever i pull up or someone pulls up i always get a look a weird one maybe of intimidation especially by people with inferior cars 95 of the time every timeas for people saying bmws arent what they used to be i completely agree you could almost say they have lost their way ive driven a few 90s bmws and a few e46s they dont make them like that anymore but what people fail to understand is while they dont if you look around and drive the equivalents of any bmw the bmw will be far superior so in conclusion bmws are still as good as they were 20 years ago compared to the competition give me a e34 m5 over a w124 500e any day of the weekbmws are the peoples car manufacturer im glad i see so many m140is on the road now everywhere and its nice to see people get to experience these incredible machines for a low cost its 2018 you can go bmw tomorrow and buy a brand new or nearly new 30 turbo straight 6 for less than 30 grand with all the kit you need where else can you do that why do people hate bmw and their drivers were just here to enjoy driving edited by chestrockwell on wednesday 12th september 0145

,PistonHeads,im in the market for a cheapish ev for commuting to school and work it would be used a couple of years old most likely ordinarily i prefer to buy cars outright but im concerned about the resale value of a 5 year old ev with various government incentives coming and going and battery technology moving forward so pcp looks an appealing option even at 8 or 9 apr what would you do finance or cashim leaning towards the id3 or the e208 currently
,PistonHeads,i havent and wont simply because of how quickly the technology is changingnot just batteries and motors but in car tech too combined and you might well find the car is worth peanuts at the end of the term and youre also more likely to want to movenow this might be entirely irrelevant with your car choice say it were a 2 year old nissan leaf that no one buys for the tech and you just want to use for the local 50 mile commute it wouldnt matter to you if the entire world had moved on in a few yearsor you could be tech savvy and dont want a car that doesnt have the latest wizzy bits you dont just do a short local commute and need something as efficient and rangey as poss if its the later rent it if its the former buy itjust my 2p
,PistonHeads,not quite the same but im looking at getting a 2021 tesla performance and was weighing up my options for funding itive got about 5k equity in my current car so id looked at just trading it in and hping the difference however evs seem to be losing value pretty rapidly compared to regular cars so im now looking at pcp with a minimal deposit and investing the 5k doesnt seem to be worth the risk of owning it unless its a cheap runaround

,PistonHeads,hello everyoneim also thinking about joining the ev community and saying goodbye to my trusty 10yearold f20 my budget aligns closely with the original posters though its easy to exceed ive done some research on overall costs and compiled a list of cars below including ownership expenses over 12 and 36 monthsive based the ev charging rates on my current octopus average tracker rate rather than opting for a dedicated ev tariff with potentially higher daytime rates for comparison a lower kwh rate of 007 would amount to 105 for the yearinsurance costs are nudging the tesla out for me mid 50s with clean licenceany thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated

,PistonHeads,this is what im thinking it only takes one greedy politician to dream up some new ev tax or a breakthrough in tech and your value falls through the floorin the context of a stable government committed to net zero and stalling ev market uptake i think significant new financial disincentives for evs are rather unlikelyany new tech will come in at the high end first a brand new superbatterypowered ev isnt going to be in market competition with your 10k five year old modelits certainly true that a finance deal protects against unexpected external shocks and its a reasonable choice if you want certainty and that evs had a big sudden drop last year but i dont see any basis to anticipate further big falls from their alreadydepressed values

,PistonHeads,id posted another thread recently about evs in the 1015k range where you can get 23 year old cars for way less than a new vehicleat that price i wouldnt be worrying too much about finance or residual values if the car meets your likely needs in terms of size and range you could easily run it for 7 or 8 years saving a decent amount vs petroldiesel and can only lose so much in terms of depreciationif its worth a few thousand at the end then thats really cheap motoring and you can look at leaf prices for an idea of what that floor might be

,PistonHeads,in time non dealer ev specialists capable of battery swaps etc will increase in number the subsequent competition will start to pull prices down it could take quite some time though as there is already a significant skills shortfall as not enough people working on cars are trained to deal with the high voltage systemsin the mean time if battery swaps are too expensive to be justified by the value of the ev in question all that will happen is that ev will lose value far more rapidly as it approaches the ten year100k mile mark the market will make a riskvalue judgement which will determine the used value of the cars if a battery swap was in the future far cheaper such cars would maintain a greater value for longeras it stands even body shops have been slow to get staff trained to deal with high voltage ev systems so its not surprising that we dont yet have several competing battery swap shops in each townone things for sure if hundreds of thousands of ev are being scrapped each year when they could with an affordable battery swap be worth 10k that massive amount of potential value will attract businesses to look at how they can both realise that value and profit from doing so manufacturers could also help by signing up national auto repair centre chains as approved partners with training etc but really no one is going to do anything much in that direction until there are hundreds of thousands of evs appearing each year that are old enough to provide regular custom for such services its all just a bit new at the momentindeed we know this is very likely to be the case at some point in the future but the precise point being made is that people are asking for numbers but getting words case in point being that your post which i grew with pretty much entirely fails to answer the question being asked it does not contain a single iota of relevant data thats the point being made as evs come off their consumer debt cycles they start to be acquired by people who have a different way at looking at value and money and further down the line at the level ph refers to as sheds you have millions and millions of car owners that we absolutely know cannot afford to replace a battery pack cannot afford for a car to deteriorate rapidly and statistically are the most reliant on their cars and covering the higher mileages its all well and good saying that certain things should happen in the future but we can already see with quite robust clarity from factual financial and demographic data that there is somewhat of an issue looming and some people asking for clarity serves as a warning for those who hear as opposed to those who dont wish to read back the point i was making was that no dependable numbers or stats exist yet and for that reason buyers acquiring the cars towards the potential end of battery life will therefore be willing to only pay a small amount limited buyer confidence will cause the cars to depreciate faster beyond a certain agethat sounds terrible for the cars 2nd3rd owners who might lose a chunk due to the car ageing but once running costs are factored in for their ownership there may well not be very much in it vs ice depreciation plus running costs for the same periodits also a likely a temporary problem as we will hopefully learn that most evs dont require a battery swap until theyre approaching the age that value would be extremely low for any car which makes the risk of financial loss very low we need thousands of each make and model of each ev to pass the 10 year100k mark before we can get any worthwhile data people may ask for it sooner but plainly they cant be give figures which dont yet existno one actually needs to take a risk thoigh ice sheds for the masses will be around for at least another 20 years more than enough time to sort battery swapping costs etc
,PistonHeads,louis louis i look at how quickly my iphone battery loses efficacy and i think it would be would you also use a tiny engine in remote controlled plane to benchmark how long your car engine might lastyes if it was the same type of enginemy cars are multicylinder fourstroke units model aero engines are little glow plug engines usually single cylinder which are completely different technologymy phones battery is the same technology as the hybrid car i am looking atelectrichybrid cars are not for you buy an ice
,PistonHeads,read back the point i was making was that no dependable numbers or stats exist yet and for that reason buyers acquiring the cars towards the potential end of battery life will therefore be willing to only pay a small amount limited buyer confidence will cause the cars to depreciate faster beyond a certain agethat sounds terrible for the cars 2nd3rd owners who might lose a chunk due to the car ageing but once running costs are factored in for their ownership there may well not be very much in it vs ice depreciation plus running costs for the same periodits also a likely a temporary problem as we will hopefully learn that most evs dont require a battery swap until theyre approaching the age that value would be extremely low for any car which makes the risk of financial loss very low we need thousands of each make and model of each ev to pass the 10 year100k mark before we can get any worthwhile data people may ask for it sooner but plainly they cant be give figures which dont yet existno one actually needs to take a risk thoigh ice sheds for the masses will be around for at least another 20 years more than enough time to sort battery swapping costs etc bit that is the precise point that im making neither you i nor anyone know the numbers from which value calculations are made some people are asking for those numbers and instead of it being explained that the data doesnt exist yet others are attempting to answer erroneously with platitudes and condescension which given they seemingly wish the slow migration to ev to be successful is a folly but nothing changes the reality that in order to accurately value an ev that is out of battery warranty one must know the cost of that battery replacement its a very basic value calculation that cant actually be done because key data is absent this also impacts the sale of new evs as the financial mechanism used require accurate calculations of the year three value as weve seen those have transpired to have been wrong and a part of the reason for that has been the failure of those manufacturers to deliver clarity on key cost risks post battery warranty periods its actually a failure of the manufacturers to recognise and understand the new product that theyre selling that missing data re projected risk costs post battery warranty is actually preventing them from accurately setting values three years out for their chosen funding mechanism traditionally manufacturers can and do rinse their hands of underpinning the values of their cars once they move them off their balance sheet which is typically and crudely correlates to the period that warranties are offered not extended this is because the pcp deals on new sales are very heavily reliant on knowing the value at the end of the deal that model is t working for evs because of the consumer discounting that you mention which in turn is being driven by the failure of the manufacturers to have realised the huge cost and implication of battery replacement risk long after the car has left their balance sheet is outweighing their ability to control year 3 values etc ie its making new ev sales more expensive because they cannot define those year 3 values accurately enough so while we can say that at some point in the future that data will naturally appear and allow for correct pricing what we can also see is that it is having a detrimental impact on new sales right now because second buyers are discounting excessively to naturally compensate for unknown risks which blows up accurate pcpleasing calcs on new sales a really good example of this would be to look at 8 year old i3 bmws what do you think would be the effect on their values if there was a known and affordable cost of battery upgrade to the 2022 spec what would be the knock on effect to the used cars 48 years where the warranty is in terminal decay phase and subsequently if the i3 were still on sale today what would be the impact from that stability on pcplease pricing people do t realising it but they are pricing risk its actually the manufacturers who have failed to understand this as theyve never had to consider it before

be willing to only pay a small amount limited buyer confidence will cause the cars to depreciate faster beyond a certain agethat sounds terrible for the cars 2nd3rd owners who might lose a chunk due to the car ageing but once running costs are factored in for their ownership there may well not be very much in it vs ice depreciation plus running costs for the same periodits also a likely a temporary problem as we will hopefully learn that most evs dont require a battery swap until theyre approaching the age that value would be extremely low for any car which makes the risk of financial loss very low we need thousands of each make and model of each ev to pass the 10 year100k mark before we can get any worthwhile data people may ask for it sooner but plainly they cant be give figures which dont yet existno one actually needs to take a risk thoigh ice sheds for the masses will be around for at least another 20 years more than enough time to sort battery swapping costs etc bit that is the precise point that im making neither you i nor anyone know the numbers from which value calculations are made some people are asking for those numbers and instead of it being explained that the data doesnt exist yet others are attempting to answer erroneously with platitudes and condescension which given they seemingly wish the slow migration to ev to be successful is a folly but nothing changes the reality that in order to accurately value an ev that is out of battery warranty one must know the cost of that battery replacement its a very basic value calculation that cant actually be done because key data is absent this also impacts the sale of new evs as the financial mechanism used require accurate calculations of the year three value as weve seen those have transpired to have been wrong and a part of the reason for that has been the failure of those manufacturers to deliver clarity on key cost risks post battery warranty periods its actually a failure of the manufacturers to recognise and understand the new product that theyre selling that missing data re projected risk costs post battery warranty is actually preventing them from accurately setting values three years out for their chosen funding mechanism traditionally manufacturers can and do rinse their hands of underpinning the values of their cars once they move them off their balance sheet which is typically and crudely correlates to the period that warranties are offered not extended this is because the pcp deals on new sales are very heavily reliant on knowing the value at the end of the deal that model is t working for evs because of the consumer discounting that you mention which in turn is being driven by the failure of the manufacturers to have realised the huge cost and implication of battery replacement risk long after the car has left their balance sheet is outweighing their ability to control year 3 values etc ie its making new ev sales more expensive because they cannot define those year 3 values accurately enough so while we can say that at some point in the future that data will naturally appear and allow for correct pricing what we can also see is that it is having a detrimental impact on new sales right now because second buyers are discounting excessively to naturally compensate for unknown risks which blows up accurate pcpleasing calcs on new sales a really good example of this would be to look at 8 year old i3 bmws what do you think would be the effect on their values if there was a known and affordable cost of battery upgrade to the 2022 spec what would be the knock on effect to the used cars 48 years where the warranty is in terminal decay phase and subsequently if the i3 were still on sale today what would be the impact from that stability on pcplease pricing people do t realising it but they are pricing risk its actually the manufacturers who have failed to understand this as theyve never had to consider it before yes each buyer from new to shed is going to be impacted by the future unknown value of the cari just dont see that as a problem as such its just a factor of a new type of car new technologies not enough proving time it is perhaps better described as annoying or inconvenient that each person buying and selling the car has to make a vague and hopefully safe assumption based on no real data but thats the deali dont think it will put off most buyers who can afford an ev and actually would quite like to have an evi also think its fairly likely that your i3 example would be worth a lot more if battery replacement was a known and relatively affordable cost especially if it could also be a cist effective time to essentially upgrade the car with bigger battery etc but whilst its a head fk trying to work out if that makes it a good buy today the reality is that through the cars life it has depreciated more so the final owner can now acquire one for thousands less than they would be able to if all things were known its not a certainty they will ever need to replace the battery but if they do they have already effectively had a saving to go towards it the car will also save them at least 1000 a year vs iceoverall despite the big bill being unwelcome it doesnt really do very much to change the value proposition i am aware that despite that logic some people could be very unlucky and that most end of car life buyers probably dont have quick access to such money

,PistonHeads,the problem is batteries tend to accelerate their decline as time goes onhmmmsome evidence suggests thisif you shorten that timeline then quite a lot of evidence points to this im going to suggest that the normal 15 year lifespan for uk cars sits well within the plateau zoneadmittedly the normal 15 year life is probably based around the average time before a repair bill makes it uneconomical to keep an ice goinga combination of some or all of tyres discs pads clutch gearbox etc will do thatmost of that is now essentially replaced by battery only so the repairability economics will play out somewhat different i guess
,PistonHeads,its a mistake to look only at the lifetime in miles or number of charge cyclestime is often a bigger killer of batteriesalso the wear factors interacttemperature matters fast charge and discharge isnt ideal as a battery gets older its efficiency suffers so there is more heating and as its capacity falls every cycle becomes a deeper discharge faster in terms of cratetelsa and others are keen to tell you about cars which have done a few hundred thousand miles and thats greatbut theyve generally done that mileage in a small number of years

,PistonHeads,id never heard of a rhd until mike brewer mentioned it on wd but he is known for getting his facts wrong the conversions you mention also used fiat parts for the lancia conversion i believerhd conversion was also done by john whalley they had to use steering rack from a normal delta as the intergrale had its own i owned one for a while in the nineties it was a very nice car but after buying it i regretted going for a rhd conversion even more so now because when we drive back to the uk in our lhd car i dont really have problems aexcept for car parks of course where i make sure the wife is with me to deal with the ticket machineshttpwwwwhalleyintegraleukcom
,PistonHeads,most of us can only go on what we read but what people generally say about the 8c is actually pretty consistentit has a bonehard ride but wallows in corners more than one person desribed it as feeling like a muscle carits engine is lazy and does nothing unless you stir it evo joked youd need a downhill slope to get close to its claimed 060the gearbox is a horriblelazy flappypaddle effort which changes gear when it feels like itits not built that well yes its an alfa but it cost over 100k and bits fallingoff is less acceptable at that price the driving position is less than ideal usually blamed on rhd conversions what the excuse is here ive no ideaits horrendously impractical not a massive concern to most people but stillthese may all be untrue but they come up time and time again so id surprised if theres not a seam of truth running through them and reality is that the cars mostly seem to be taking up trader showroom space and not road spacei dont remember reading much of the above when the car was launched i just had a quick check on autocar car and evo reviews i found available on the net and they were generally quite positive although it was recognised that dynamically the alfa wasnt the best car available which reviews are you referring to that are so much more negativeanyway my point is more that car journalists generally drive cars to the limit often on a test track and are also paid to write something interesting and different about each car they drive they wouldnt last long if all they could say is yes another great car for the average driver who uses a car normally i am sceptical whether there is much difference dynamically between an 8c and a f430 and that the the difference in aesthetics noise perceived quality and brand snobbery would play a much larger role in whether the alfa or ferrari are preferred
,PistonHeads,this one has been for sale for a while now was 99k a couple of months ago tooactually i was tempted at 99k so looks even better nowmight treat myself for christmas
,PistonHeads,ill never understand why so many people are put off buying a vehicle because the steering wheel is on the other side of the vehicle get a mate to come with you when you pick it up to keep an eye on your driving and give you a poke if you start to drift into sitting behind the right hand tail lamp of the car in front on the motorway be prepared to bang your left hand into the door a few times early on when you think of changing gear but really its a couple of weeks if you drive daily and youll never look backthe reason why i mentioned i wouldnt want an 8c in this country due to it being lhd has little to do with not being physically able to drive it i drive lhd on the continent all the timeif i were in a position to own one of these i would be the person that used it lots and then i would just be annoyed every time i needed to enter or exit a car park or toll booth if i wanted a sly mcdonalds drive through when i was exiting a slip road but most importantly that i wouldnt be able to safely pick my overtaking opportunities on single carriageway roadsits all the above that have stopped me pulling the trigger on an e30 m3 and a mercedes 500e and a v8 engined alpina e36
,PistonHeads,its all the above that have stopped me pulling the trigger on an e30 m3 and a mercedes 500e and a v8 engined alpina e36ive owned my 832 forever and have not experienced any of the difficulties you mention you are missing out on some great cars
,PistonHeads,i dont remember reading much of the above when the car was launched i just had a quick check on autocar car and evo reviews i found available on the net and they were generally quite positive although it was recognised that dynamically the alfa wasnt the best car available which reviews are you referring to that are so much more negativeyou wont actually find a huge amount written about the 8c because it seems the press only got to drive it on alfas own track not that many journos have driven the car properly in fact the only one i could find online was top gearfrom evos first drive the delivery isnt explosive and youd need a peachy launch and maybe a downhill slope to match alfas 42sec claim for the 062mph benchmark but the 8c has long legs and its easy to believe the claimed 181mph top speed in tests at nardo it actually reached 186mph however all is not quite as the hardride and wonderfully rorty exhaust would have you believe push harder and the body control starts to unravel body roll building quite rapidly and getting more exaggerated as each curve unfolds evofunnily enough i remember reading a distinctly hmmm review in car the actual magazine not the website and their summary reads the 8c remains less of a drivers car than rivals which backsthatup but gavin greens piece again based on driving on alfas track only is more positive httpwwwcarmagazinecoukdrivessearchresultsits clear alfa didnt intend this to be any other car or any sort of competitor to anything else hence they didnt offer press carsseek more publicity than its looks would generate alonei walked past 2 mitos last night tho and thought now thats just a bit too similar if i parked an 8c there people might not notice it
,PistonHeads,on the lhd thing i cannot believe even for a second anyone is lazy enough to quote drivethrusyou can get out and go into the place to get food yknow also our local mcds seems to send 80 of customers to the waiting spaces anyway so its not an issue also overtaking is not an issue because if youre doing it properly youre far enough back to see clearly from either seat leaving room to build speed and have an oh st moment and duck backso its just tunnel tolls and parking machines then and who cares
,PistonHeads,on the lhd thing i cannot believe even for a second anyone is lazy enough to quote drivethrushow many people are going to take a car like this to a drivethrough car parks may be more of an issue but surely you only buy a car like this for special days on the open road rather than a roundcity hack
2022-01-31,PistonHeads,got one on order delivery hopefully in march fiat dealer gave us a car for a couple of hours to test drive and we both liked it when compared to a zoe nearly went for a peugeot 208e for practical reasons but no good pch deals at the time battery range should be better than mini or honda e but its a city car not a long range cruiser anticipating 1 or 2 charges per week at home theres only 1 owners review on parkers and its not positive but hopefully those issues are not common
2022-02-01,PistonHeads,ive got one had it since nov ours is very much a town car used for short journeys only once have i needed to charge it on a public rather than at homerange is certainly less than the 199 indeed a full charge only shows range of 161 available i have not tested the range particularly but we could probably get 140 but not much motorway in thatits the wifes car really but we both use it whenever we can wife had an ice 500 a few years ago i hated it and refused to drive it gutless uncomfortable however the 500e is everything the ice isnt more spacious good driving position pokey off the lights like most evs i imagine but also happy to be at cruising speed looks good toothere has been a few software niggles but nothing much nothing i have needed to take back to the dealer for i am very impressed with itlots of info and views in the fiat 500 electric uk facebook groupshout if you want any more specific info
2022-02-01,PistonHeads,yes i discovered that facebook group today so have a pending join request i dont need to order till april anyway everything ive read on them says they actually are competent at cruising speed and are relatively happy at 60 or so mph i can charge up at work for free 200 chargers albeit not high wattage be silly not to consider one have own garage drive so would get a wall charger as well but in the main probably charge away from home
,PistonHeads,thinking of hiring one of these in italy in june only need it for a day and the route ive penciled in is about 80 miles of mixed towncountry driving ill probably get lost so lets call it 100 miles it should have a full tank when i pick it up and can return it empty daft idea or not took my wifes 130 miles mainly on the m1 last august so was warm got home with 30 miles left in it was driving a bit slooooowwww on the way home but easily achievable if youve an extra 10 mins or so spare think it charges max 80kwh so even if you were caught offguard without a full tank to start itd be a 510 min job to get a 1520 in it extra from a decent chargeredited by markt17 on wednesday 24th january 1548
,PistonHeads,thinking of hiring one of these in italy in june only need it for a day and the route ive penciled in is about 80 miles of mixed towncountry driving ill probably get lost so lets call it 100 miles it should have a full tank when i pick it up and can return it empty daft idea or not should be more than fineeven if you do more been to italy last summer and especially in the north they have a lot of charging points so when doing a quick stop somewhere you could plug it in if youre worried about range
,PistonHeads,i had one for a few weeks whilst i was waiting for my i4 m50 to arrive on balance id say the m50 definitely feels quicker but seriously mrs deuce still wants to buy one as a runaround it was a very good little car really its quite surprising how much electrification helps a town car it makes them smoother to drive in general and the instant torque makes them excellent at nipping out of junctions and onto busy roundaboutsours was mid range spec definitely worth adding on adaptive cruise if it was a long term car though it makes stopstart traffic far less irritatinginterior wise its a fiat plenty of plastics and very rudimentary infotainment compared to more premium brands but it has wireless carplayandroid auto so youll likely never use the cars own system other than to tweak settingsother than that you simply get what you pay for in reasonably attractive in a mumsnet way car without any niggles worth mention the ride is worth a nod its no rolls royce but pretty good by town car standards
,PistonHeads,im certainly intrigued how this will turn out im not into evs as such another topic entirely but the only one thats piqued my interest was the honda e i liked it being designed as a city car range wasnt so relevant it had some character and looked fun to drive im hoping that this r5 reimagining will be similar also having owned an r5 i hope they have kept the looks relatable and not just stuck a badge on from an old brand that looks nothing like i mean credit to the mini and especially the fiat 500 for looking like modern versions of their old models
,PistonHeads,i think its going to look great and i hope that im still interested when it launchesid prefer it to have figures closer to the mini e though it has a smaller battery 326kwh and more power 181hp im personally not bothered about range in a car like this i dont think ive ever driven more than 50 miles in one journey in my up gti
,PistonHeads,they have the launch car on their websiteit doesnt look much like the concept concepts never look like the road cars for small hatchbacks ever it just doesnt work with the regs
,PistonHeads,130hp is very low for an ev imofor what its worth to me an ev that is small efficient and affordable is far more interesting than one which is incredibly fast and 5 metres long so long as itll crack 060 in around 10s thats fine thats all the fiesta i had as a runaround until recently did very sensible unfortunately their are still many that are well electrically charged
,PistonHeads,renault are selling an r pass this is basically an opportunity to order your renault a little earlier for 150this is a car that hasnt been seen or reviewed or driven by anyone outside renault and they want to milk it as if its a porsche gt cari am very interested but wont be parting with any cash until ive seendriven one or at least read a trusted review
,PistonHeads,would look better more authentic in a single colour in two tone it looks like a fiat 500 mini with renault 5 headlights
,PistonHeads,the rotrex affordablelets see shall we to set expectations affordable is 30k especially if its not chinese madeif theyre going to undercut the zoe looking at the website the cheapest zoe seems to be 31195 with themini electric from 32550fiat 500 electric from 28195i recon theyll still pitch it starting with a 3 though due to all the nostalgic 50 year olds with some money
,PistonHeads,this is one ev im interested in if anyone can get it right renault can as a previous owner of renaultsport cars i know they can do iti hope they dont try to make it sound and feel like an ice car let it be what it is
,PistonHeads,why has my topic been binned into the ev section and this one left in general gassing
,PistonHeads,fyi prereg fiat 500e are less than 16k theyre terrible admittedly but still
,PistonHeads,nomme de as a handy urban runabout i quite like that but manufacturers please please please stop with the ipad controls and apparently a complete lack of instruments in front of the driver unless theres a hudpersonally i think touch screen is less safe we become familiar with the locations of certain button knobs etc so there is no need to take concentration away from the road touch screen with layers is much less intuitive imo i do really like the hud and voice control maybe a better optionnot only location familiarity but the difficulty of hitting a specific part of a screen when the car is moving about is incredibly distracting what is an effortless tap when the car is stationary becomes very hit and miss without deliberate concentration i dont see much if any difference in the level of concentration or distraction involved whether using a touch screen when a car is in motion or interacting with a hand held mobile phone both are far more distracting than pushing a physical switch or button which can be done by feel and which has a physical presence that is much easier to connect with when the car is moving abouttouch screens in cars are a cost saving measure primarily all those instruments lights and physical buttons and all the wiring that connects them can be replaced with a single relatively cheap oled panel or two and a vastly simplified wiring loom extrapolated over a production run this represents a significant amount of moneyby removing any instruments from in front of the driver theres another cost saving in that both lhd and rhd markets can be catered for with the same partstouch screens are fantastic things just not in cars imo
,PistonHeads,its a golfsized car with a golfsized amount of space for passengers and luggage it appears no better or worse packaged than a medium hatchback not really i have a mk75 golf and can carry 5 adults with 4 carry on suitcases with no problem 6ft people in front and behindsame as i could also carry in a toyota yaris mk1 hybrid or a honda jazz mk4 hybrid or even my old volvo xv40 decently designed cars dont have a problem with interior space i recently had a skoda scala hire car and that was absolutely huge inside despite being based on a poloapart from slightly tight shoulders in the back on the smaller ones but legroom was completely finethe ex30 is frustrating as the performance equipment price and looks are all goodid have bought a nice bright coloured base model except i cant fit anyone in the back
,PistonHeads,slower is safer speed killsslower is not safer it just allows a certain type of driver to not focus properly on driving im go slow what can happen attitudespeed does not kill bad driving kills thats a big and major differencetalking of bad driving just like a lot of ev drivers i come across afraid to accelerate reasonable quickly enough to get up to speed staying 20 mph below the speed limit usually on a single lane road i wouldnt be surprised if they fail to switch on head lights and the heater to demist the screen too

,PistonHeads,fiat 500e are both still great looking cars albeit quite old now and just converted ice cars fwiw this isnt actually true the 500e sits on an allelectric platform its not a retrod version of the ice car

,PistonHeads,its aimed at younger customers not old people i dont think anybody likes the giant touchscreen thing in cars to be fair i like the one in my model y it is great almost everything i need to look at or operate is in one place and i can also use voice control i have no desire to back to a car with loads of buttons
,PistonHeads,nomme de or acceleration manufacturers should spend more time trying to make an ev that has a higher range sure most people wont need to drive 600 miles in one go everyday but its nice to know that your fridge on wheels wont need charging for 3 weeks since youre only doing 10 mile journeys everyday with everything switched on lights heatingac radio etcthe range is largely a function of the battery capacity the longer the range the more the cost and weight battery technology is improving and will double triple over the next few years for most people doing typical day to day motoring the range is perfectly adequate for the relatively few that need a longer range then the best thing is to wait a few years by 2030 when it starts to matter the range will equal the ice equivalentsi know why it is where it is but i dont want to plug it in for 8 hours i want to plug it in for 3 minutes and then have full range available
,PistonHeads,ok im out little on ph surprises me anymore but you being repeatedly told by someone who doesnt have an ev that your ev is broken because it doesnt achieve what the manufacturers say it will nor what a motoring magazines contrived testing says it will is elite even for heremrs c and i have done 5000 ev miles in the past couple of years in all weathers and never once encountered col range issues like the trm is describing does that not entitle me to an opinionas for the contrived testing i dont accept that unless you can find a better way to compare multiple cars like that in a short space of time i thought their test covered the major realworld scenarios in cold weather and would have expected the sort of significant range issues that trm is describing to become apparent the only car that performed anywhere near as badly as his was the ora funky cat which tells me that something isnt right with his polestar i simply dont accept that idea that hes presenting his experience as the real world when its so easy to refute it

,PistonHeads,talking of bad driving just like a lot of ev drivers i come across afraid to accelerate reasonable quickly enough to get up to speed staying 20 mph below the speed limit usually on a single lane road i wouldnt be surprised if they fail to switch on head lights and the heater to demist the screen toothis is my experience too i asked my tesladriving uber driver recently if he knew the limit of the road he was on yes its 60mph i asked him why he was doing 35mph there was a big queue behind us occasionally overtaking and he sort of shrugged that ended any conversation i just assumed they didnt know the road or the limit but its all about battery life conservation apparently

,PistonHeads,it is interesting to note that the bar for huge acceleration like this offers at 50 ish grand is coming down and downits kind of a no brainer in an ev you need to stick two motors in to provide 4wd doesnt have the packaging and cooling issues big ice engines havebe interesting to track where the lowest price vs acceleration potential you dont have to use it goes over the next few years as the aforementioned chines manufacturers make further inroads batteries improve and they lower prices and chuck in more power to sweeten the deal they will only get faster for less moneywill there be a sub 3 sec to sixty sub 30k car at some point
,PistonHeads,we have a c40 ultimate and it doesnt get anywhere near its claimed range in real world driving and its even worse in the cold weather my wifes family are 160 miles away and she cant quite get there on a full charge when she stops to recharge there is always a queue and as soon as she plugs in people are knocking on the window asking how long she will be on anything other than local driving it is basically a pain to use needless to say we are getting rid of itfor balance we have a c40 core so the lowest spec and single motor last week drove to disneyland paris and we got just over 200 miles with 10 remaining we never queued once for a charger and the only issue was on our first stop two chargers were down there was another 3 available and the next one worked fine i was also very impressed with the charging speed by the time we had taken the kids to the loo and bought some snacks the car was ready to go againedited by j1ms on friday 9th june 1008
,PistonHeads,according to posters on here there are enough bad drivers on the road with ordinary cars that take 8 plus seconds or more to reach 60the last thing we need is a plethora of one trick pony electric cars that can do it in sub 4 seconds

,PistonHeads,almost everything hereinabove smacks of peacockery and codpiece real men dont feel the need to brag about it a real mans car surely is a saloon or at a push a fixed head coupé it is quiet discreet and unassuming it is ultra high quality and unquestionably reliable and of course it is fast none of the many cars presently on sale meets all of these criteria with the possible exception of the maserati quattroporte which is somewhat spoiled by being unavailable in a tasetful specification and associated with those vulgar and excessive coupéscars which best represent the breed are1 mercedesbenz 500 e but not with big wheels and blacked out windows2 aston martin v8 vantage prince of wales spec gunmetal grey metallic preferred3 jaguar sovereign series iii v124 bmw m5 e28 only though not a red one5 mercedesbenz 300 se l 636 mercedesbenz 450 se l 697 any frontengined v12 ferrari with a manual transmission up to and including the 575m but emphatically not the 599 which really is only for secretly gay arab princes or men who wish they were secretly gay arab princes so long as it is neither red nor black nor upholstered in red leather fitment of an after market exhaust immediately disqualifies the vehicle from manly status the manly ferrari is a difficult one to pull off as it were a silver 412 upholstered in brown leather and fitted up with the 5 speed manual is the epitome of the mans ferrarii thought the op wanted manly youve gone for old manly

2020-07-21,PistonHeads,i love the dashboard interior etc it reminds of yesteryear with a modern touch i like the styling toobut ill never in my life spend 30 grand on a car i suppose so its all irrelevant
2020-07-21,PistonHeads,its a funky looking car but i really dont understand the niche that its supposed to fill ditto with the mini electricboth are nearly as long as an i3 so perhaps a bit chonkers for a city car yet neither have the range to be truly useful out of town fiat seem much closer to the mark with the 500e both in size and range albeit not price
2020-07-21,PistonHeads,we had an i3 a few years ago and she loved it but the problem is those pesky ic cars and the value they offer we looked at evs a couple of years ago but in the end came home with a heavily discounted brand new a6 black edition for less money the a6 has space comfort relative performance and reliabilty ok in the 4 years since you bought your a6 how much has it lost in depreciation my i3 cost me 16200 45 years ago with just 376 miles on the clock exdealer demo today its still worth around 15000 ive never owned a car thats depreciated so little add in the tiny 21 pence per mile total running costs and so say ice offer value is frankly simply not true ime ok ok i bought when not many people wanted an ev and now people do but given the constriction of supply of evs i think depreciation is going to remain low on them for a while yet
2020-07-21,PistonHeads,love it but it seems odd that a company so well known for technical brilliance couldnt do better on the range its almost as if they stopped development three years ago
2020-07-21,PistonHeads,sight unseen dont support any politically motivated battery car stuff no more tolerance battery cars have only one goal to limit individual mobilityso a device for personal transportation is being pushed to limit personal mobility by the government or some shady cabal a tesla can in the right circumstances do 300 miles on a charge new battery tech is coming can still buy ice carswhere do people get these ideas from dont inflict your persecution complex on the rest of usas for the car as a middle aged bloke i should hate it i dont it looks pretty good and the range would be fine for me most of the timebut i can see how chaps of a similar ilk maybe owning a 12 year old passat diesel will say it wont go far enough which is true but its not really a substitute for a diesel saloon is it yes its pricey but guess what some people can afford it and can countenance spending all that on something nice even if it isnt the most for the least money
2020-07-21,PistonHeads,to be honest for 98 of the year this would work fine as an only car for us because we almost never do 100 miles in one day and we have a garage so could be charging it when not in use however it would mean having to rent something else for the other 2 which could be a pain if i were marketing this type of car i would think about having that facility ie owners get access to rental car for up to two weeks at preferential rates and they can be booked easily and deliveredpicked upi think this is the thinking a lot of people would go through for those few times 2 maybe something like zipcar would be a solutionbut then we wont all be living in a world of whitegoods onwheels until its time for fun otherwise who would buy the truly mega cars
2020-07-21,PistonHeads,love it but it seems odd that a company so well known for technical brilliance couldnt do better on the range its almost as if they stopped development three years ago its nothing to do with development they simply have chosen to use a smaller and therefore lighter battery its range is real world for its target market
2020-07-21,PistonHeads,so a device for personal transportation is being pushed to limit personal mobility by the government or some shady cabal its bizarre i feel the exact opposite with an ev i can fuel it at home or anywhere with electricity one of the most plentiful easiest things to get in a modern society i can even generate it at home if i like i dont have to rely on huge oil companies and global supply chains and pricing thats controlled by some saudi princes
2020-07-21,PistonHeads,one thing that puzzles me about the interior of what is an ev the most power hungry parts of most devices are the screen and communications so here we add multiple screens each neding its own communications why not just add mirrors and have one screen with multiple functions even in the photos you can see the same information music track being shown on two screens at the same time why fundamental point the primary purpose of a vehicle is to move everything else is subservient to that so focus upon range after all 5 screens wont look cool when youre stuck at the side of the road

2020-07-21,PistonHeads,sandpit my mothers honda jazz has less miles after 11 years than i put on my primary car in a year for her all the mechanical gubbins are simply things that go wrong and many of us know the pitfalls of ultra low mileage cars ice like to be used so while of course this car is not aimed at me in any way for my mother it is utterly perfect the only issue is the price which seems high for what it is but then i am suffering from sticker shock at the moment on all cars yes it would suit my mum too a second car in a retired family that never really goes out of town except that her current ten year old runabout cost her two grand i can see the attraction if you live and work in london but not until every lamp post has a charging port because very few people in london have a driveway another good point earlier about rental cars that companies selling small city electric cars should have a deal to be able easily rent something for the weekend at a good discount i had a thought the other day and a good lie down after that this whole charging at home and from lamp posts etc idiocy cos like that will ever happen is a complete red herring we dont fuel our cars at home actually i live in a farming area but lets park that one so why especially in urban areas would we need this just because the car is electric the real issue is delivering a usable range pick the number which i shall say for the sake of argument is 200 miles that is achievable in 5 minutes of charge then build charging stations convert petrol stations and voila and i think this will come im convinced the speed of tech change will allow something along these lines very swiftly until then electric cars are really not very democratic if you cant afford a driveway you cant have the car but once really fast charging is available for most peoples 1 week travel job done
2020-07-21,PistonHeads,sort of it looks quite nice the interior is a bit lagonda and will age terribly though and replacing mirrors with cameras is such a form before function moveit puts me right off fair enough on a motorway cruiser pointless on a 90 mile range city car i quite like the interior materials thoughbut its just too much money for something with such limited use i dont think its desirable or interesting enough to justify the price electric cars shouldnt still have this stupid premium its an 18 grand car without the batteries
2020-07-21,PistonHeads,i took one of these out for a test drive yesterday as my daily is a 450bhp s5 i wasnt expecting this to feel quick but the power is instant and it felt really good on the road its loaded with clever tech including a virtual fishtank and when stationary you can feed them

,PistonHeads,ill kick this off owned one 2007 43 coupe loved it but big bills at 30k to 40k miles i spent a lot getting my fully histories two owner car sorted over the 10000 miles i had it and stuff went wrong every month mostly consumables though so if this car has had clutch brakes and suspension done recently ok but absolutely every part on these cars costs an enormous amount more than ferraris for some stuff 600 for a single coil spring anyone as you will find on the numerous threads on these here and specialists charge almost as much labour as dealers floating around somewhere on the am forum is my hilarious think thousands quote to get the brakes replaced when you start replacing things like engine mounts and suspension arms as you will on a high mileage car like this have lots of cash ready for parts and have a local garage do the workand the electronics are made of chocolate woe betide you if you need to replace a module somewhere i did and i weptid have a convertible 47 version again though im stupid like that gorgeous looks noise and drive hateful reliabilityedited by harry flashman on saturday 4th may 0750
,PistonHeads,completely agree stop buying cars with low mileage and being scared to use them i love my 150k audi because all the depreciation is over with i also had a fiat coupe which had over 100k on it buy high and seller higher thats my motto
,PistonHeads,i had a 2006 43 for a couple of years lovely car never went wrong not cheap to service has been eluded but no more than my tvrs back in the day you could get good maintenance from rick kay at dms since closed down also great presence and loads of friendly commentsid have another one but would go for a newer 47 but then thats really the point of the brave pilllooking at the how well this has been maintained i think it would be worth a punt maybe sub 20k though
,PistonHeads,ive also owned one a 2005 couple which i bought about 7 years ago mine was very low mileage about 30k at the time but i think i was the 7th owner so it had had about 1 a year at the time servicing costs was not excessive and the only 2 non service items were new brake pads and a new rear bumper because the old one sort of had bowed somehow you couldnt really see it unless you looked and the light caught it nothing went wrong with it for the time i had ithowever as much as a tried to like it i never really got on with it they do look fantastic mine was black but it lacks something 2 turbos in my opinion so it went after 18 months maybe the v12 would have been better for me but i cant afford one of those finally they do look way better than the new vantage
,PistonHeads,aston now offers two fixed price services for the v8 one at 660 and the other at 800 odd plus vat plus parts thats not ridiculous by any standardscoil packs are 2k each however so you need to be prudent looking at the service history on one you intend to buy for the average of 45k difference between private and main dealer pricing on an 06 plate then my money would be on the dealer as you can get them to sort minor issues as part of the dealthe v12 vantage is around 60k or twice the money and is the better car all around if you want performance and looks i predict these will hold their money better as they are effectively the last v12 supercar with a proper stick box that is available
,PistonHeads,lovely lookingsounding cars i would love one however they seem poor value for money you are paying a premium for the name a jaguar xkr would be half the price and a lot better equipped
,PistonHeads,lovely lookingsounding cars i would love one however they seem poor value for money you are paying a premium for the name a jaguar xkr would be half the price and a lot better equippedtrue but you wont have an aston sitting on the drive thats why these are a premium over a jag some may think thats sad but the badge has a lot of draw stillowned two coupe then a roadster for a few years worth it for the noise alone
,PistonHeads,my 2006 vantage has just over 60k miles on it they need to be used regularly but otherwise mine has been very reliable bamford rose and other independents are fantastic with these cars driving mine takes a bit of effort heavy clutch etc but the noise handling and confidence it inspires is fantastic buy on condition and history not mileage use it regularly forget depreciation keep it clean and serviced and you will enjoy every trip except being stuck in traffic if you can get one with the lighter clutch then even better people are interested in the car not you i happily let dads and lads sit in and rev the engine it makes me happy that other people appreciate a nice car if you buy one of these you might have the odd bill in the hundreds but the lack of depreciation and enjoyment easily outweighs that
,PistonHeads,mines been reliable a few consumables over the years but nothing too outrageous ive owned it for about 7 years now and its currently on around 51k of which 35k are mine still on its original clutch no electrical maladies at all if you shop around brake parts are on par with my rrs and take minutes to fit due to the design of the calipers my ownership experience is the complete opposite of harrys and has been uneventful with regards to wallet opening brave pill not needed scoff some mms instead
,PistonHeads,the v12 vantage is around 60k or twice the money and is the better car all around if you want performance and looks i predict these will hold their money better as they are effectively the last v12 supercar with a proper stick box that is available yes that struck me recently as well remarkably cheap to my mind for what you get and what the potential must be for them must have been early 2007 when the boss i had at the time got into one of these on a 2year lease having not really ever been much of an aston fan ive always had a soft spot for these ever since cracking looking things its 911s i dream of though so a 997 would be hard to resist at this price point more practical too though i imagine it lacks as much theatre
,PistonHeads,hiso my sister is set on getting an ev her mito is getting on a bit and shed like to have a lookrange isnt that important for her she does about 50kmweek and she doesnt have kidsfor the once in a year further trip a reasonable fast charging speed would be greatly appreciatedin the end i narrowed it down to three cars shes probably going to test drivepeugeot e208mini serenault zoethe e208 seems to take preference now the mini because of range and charging seems like a risk to take as an only car same reasons we didnt include the honda eive got a couple questions though am i forgetting any obvious ones is it possible to get a towing hook on any of these for bicycle rack ive found conflicting reports on android auto for the mini is it available the other two seem to have it
,PistonHeads,looking for more information seems that its not even possible to get a tow hook on any of these even for a bicycle rackadded the kona electric to the mix as its still in the price range 35k gbp
,PistonHeads,the mazda was out for the range charging reasonsthe i3 i really like but was dismissed instantly because of the lookscorsa seems like a more dull e208 tbhdidnt know the ds3 came as an ev ill have a look
,PistonHeads,as her mileage is so low wouldnt a phev be a better optionit would always run on battery except for the onceayear trip which would then not have any rangecharging concernsnot sure how it would compare pricewise possibly cheaper and more likely to be able to fit a towbar
,PistonHeads,as her mileage is so low wouldnt a phev be a better optionit would always run on battery except for the onceayear trip which would then not have any rangecharging concernsnot sure how it would compare pricewise possibly cheaper and more likely to be able to fit a towbarwhile i see your point her current car is now well over a decade old so she keeps her cars long time regulations here benelux have been cracking down on phevs year after yearanother point of consideration for her is that she can charge on a couple of locations on a weekly basis not at home or at work which she would utilize a bev with 150km range will allow her to bridge it for a couple of weeks a phev with 30km would strugglein the end she really wants a bev and i cant blame herbut to follow on the phev path are their any interesting smallish phevspeugeot has a couple iirc
,PistonHeads,brink do bikeonly towbars for a lot of evs now the ball has little nubs on the side so you cant tow but can fit a bike rack httpswwwebaycoukitmbrinktowbarforrenaulid3 is a little larger but has the factory option of a transport hitch that goes neatly behind the numberplate and is for carrying bikes
,PistonHeads,from what reviews that i have seen stelantis products seem pretty good and onpoint for what people want all have the same drivetrain battery combinations but differing styling and target market watched johnny smith do a backtoback on the 2008 citroen and corsa models impressed by them all being different but rated them i suspect it will come down to personal perspective and pricing though
,PistonHeads,i3 as others great vehicle i3s even more so
,PistonHeads,i3 as others great vehicle i3s even more soyep but lets be honest here the looks are polarizing at best i love it and have a bright blue one but totally understand that it isnt for everyone
,PistonHeads,i3 as others great vehicle i3s even more soagree but if you dont like the looksfor the budget the id3 looks a solid overall package offering practicality range performance charging speeds and bike carrying ability
,PistonHeads,agree but if you dont like the looksfor the budget the id3 looks a solid overall package offering practicality range performance charging speeds and bike carrying abilityyeah the id3 is shortlisted as well nowive seen most cars have aftermarket towing hooks that can only carry bicycle racks but shed like the manufacturer optionvw id3hyundai kona electrici havent seen the 2021 kona electric yet looks great on the pictures

,PistonHeads,my wife started a new job which meant she would hand her company car back 20 mile each way mainly town driving with free charging points at work steered her down the electric route for her work commutershe decided on a fiat 500e icon in matte grey with a few extrasi was on the fence but actually grown quite fond of it its been averaging 160 miles to a full charge advertised 180 however she has got that up to around 170 now shes got used to the regenerative braking systemits an absolute hoot to drive just a nippy little go kart and due to the regen braking you can drive it 95 of the time accelerator only the battery also gets the cog nice and low
,PistonHeads,oh buy your mrs some jeans without holes in eh poor thingi like the 500e btw
,PistonHeads,oh buy your mrs some jeans without holes in eh poor thingi like the 500e btwperhaps those are the ops legs didyoujustassumegender
,PistonHeads,in were aiming to test drive one of these soon really like the look of them and the reviews ive seen suggest the quality and feel is pretty impressivecan i ask does that glass roof panel tilt andor slide
,PistonHeads,like the look of that especially in that spec i have a little eup on order due next month as a commuter car i quite fancied one of these 500es but they were more expensive than i thought they would be and it was too large a difference in price for a 2 year lease 7k compared to 45k for the vw
,PistonHeads,i like the colour so is the braking like a bumper car lift off the pedal and it stops lift off slowly and it slows downyes 3 modesnormal no regen brakingrange regen braking as you say like a bu per carsherpa limits a lot of functions to max in were aiming to test drive one of these soon really like the look of them and the reviews ive seen suggest the quality and feel is pretty impressivecan i ask does that glass roof panel tilt andor slideunfortunately not its fixed id have to dig out the book but believe it was a circa 700 that looks greatso much so that i checked the price 26k eek31k including the extras on this icon model minus government grant my wife didnt want a cabriolet which is the high spec 500e so we went with the highest spec non cab which is the icon with a few extras to bring it pretty much up to cab spec
,PistonHeads,just read the autocar review mainly positive but around 31000 are they taking the proverbial
,PistonHeads,31k is bonkers it is but its the standard electric tax anything electric has massive premium loaded onto it cynic in me says its to gather up front a lifetime of saved servicing costs but they will claim its development cost recouping a gap that will conveniently not close before the fossil fuel versions are withdrawn they will sell it to you based on lower running costs ofc
,PistonHeads,i was in melksham today and found myself behind a beautiful showroom condition 89 ford escort rs turboi was going to post a similar thread and oddly enough i live in hilperton about 3 miles from melkshamive not seen the rs turbo but there are a number of beautiful normally older cars driven by old dears pootling about i havent seen it for a while but there is a minter than mint 60s mini cooper driven by an old lady at around 20mph everywhere i like to think shes had it since new and only pops to tesco in it so probably has about 20k on itin 10 years here i can count the number of supercars ive seen locally on one hand but there is loads of old stuff in mint condition
,PistonHeads,in frankfurt this happens all the time lots of older people driving around in cars they bought new some time ago a couple in their late 80s for example in a perfect w125 500emy favorite is an old dear easily in her 80s driving a e30 m3 convertible drives it year round old plates meaning she had it for a long time probably since new
,PistonHeads,i was down in devon a few weeks ago and spotted an old lady in an mg maestro ok that isnt too badass but it was pretty cool this week i have been spotting a more senior lady driving the opposite way to me on my commute driving a classic w124era merc which may or may not be of amg flavour but it certainly has the appropriate bodykit for it but i havent ever seen the back of it to know for certain but it looks very cool
,PistonHeads,theres an old boy near me who on appearance looks to be in his 80s or maybe even his 90s going on how frail he has become bless him his car of choice is a c reg 205 gti with a full cage buckets harnesses and semi slicks it has a white motorsport number square on the side too i have no idea if he still competes in anything but i regularly see him going at a fair lick down the lanes near me saying that i havent seen him for a few months hope he is still about and enjoying himselfa few years back i remember regularly seeing a lady in leamington spa who was comfortably in her 70s driving a completely standard icelle blue evo 6
,PistonHeads,i was going to post about my mum who bought an impreza back in 1999 and was referred to as granny mcrae by the boys in the local butchers shopbut then i remembered thatit was a sport so although it looked the part it wasnt at all badass not even slightlyin 1999 she was 62 years old which is only 7 years older than i am nowchrist i feel old
,PistonHeads,i tutor the grandchild of a pretty wealthy family great kid humble and modest etc hence why when granny drives my grandads old james bond car i thought he mightve meant an old db7 or something nope db5 she still drives it according to the boys father who was evidently excited about the eventual prospect of this family heirloom becoming his
,PistonHeads,my mate drove a civic in the late 90searly 00s 16 16v with a few mods it wasnt the slowest thing aroundsitting in the inside lane at a set of traffic lights where the outside merges a bit down the road jag pulls up beside him with an older lady at the wheel mates dad who was sitting beside him winds him up dont let her get away with that son shes going to dive in front of youcivic revs up dumps the clutch roars off only for the jag to come absolutely smoking past him before turning into the jag garage half a mile down the roadmates dad took quite a while to stop laughing
,PistonHeads,i think i can trump everyone else how about pegthe car is the 1914 french gp winning mercedesok so she doesnt drive it but is the riding mechanic she leans out on corners in other cars she pumps the oil pressure and oils the camshaft at the same time shes magnificent mummy wheres granny on some hillclimb keeping the oil pressure up in a 28litre carand badass the fiat s76 is bad out of every orifice she rides in geo windgards cars a wellknow feature of the goodwood festival of speedmore images and a video on httpwritewheelukarticlespegtheredoubtablea remarkable woman
,PistonHeads,my nan and grandad had matching vtec preludes with 4ws at one point i always thought that was bloody cool even though to most peoples eyes they were fairly boggo for their age group
,PistonHeads,any love for the above car looks to tick most of our boxes and the reviews are favourable with rear space being the only potential issueif not anything else to consider in the 2023k bracket
,PistonHeads,the problem with any peugeot is that you immediately lose the ability to drive all of a sudden youre trundling down motorway on ramps at 23 mph and stopping at the end being overtaken by normal people that understand that you have to accelerate to merge with 70mph trafficyou will also lose the ability to indicate you will start to brake for the turn and then indicate not at all irritatingbest of all you will develop a desire to drive down a 60mph broad at 40mph and then continue through a 30mph road at 40mph no one with a peugeot knows any other speedif ev is the future of the car im not sure being a peugeot driver is the future of being a driverapart from all of that the car looks crap
2022-07-31,PistonHeads,weve had one for nearly 2 years its ok bit small inside and the driving position isnt great for me but its the ohs car so i dont drive it too often she likes the nippiness of it but wouldnt have another would probably get either a mini electric or a fiat 500e next time as i cant persuade her that an i3 is a design classic
2022-07-31,PistonHeads,i think they look fantastic ive driven a new corsa which i understand is the same chassis beneath and it did have horrifically crashy suspension hopefully the peugeot is tuned differently but otherwise really quiet and refined cabin only problem with peugeots is their obsession with forcing you to steer with a fat bottle cap which you must peer over as it obscures your view of the dials this plagues ruins all of their models theyd be great cars otherwisefunny enough the wife complains about the suspension in my corsa e ive no complaint myself though they are the same car beneath the shell its not the most economical ev and the range is not what they quote but im happy with it for the most part
2022-08-01,PistonHeads,weve got one as a long term courtesy vehicle a gt spec one in bluewifes zoe went in for an aircon issue 9 weeks ago they took it apart ordered some bits and we are still waiting but anywaythe pug is actually a really nice bit of kit swathes of alcantara type material fake leather and some coloured stitching really comfortable seats in the front at least quite sporty stick it in sport mode its nippy enough handles okay well the steering is dead and inert like everything else but you are low down and it does that magic ev trick of surprising you how well it goes around a roundaboutdownsidesdoesnt seem to have a real charging scheduler all you can do is delay charging to a set time then it charges to 100 the zoe timer starts and stops making it very compatible with cheap overnight tariffsno heated seats optionwife prefers to be higher up and therefore prefers the zoeoverall a real contender for when the zoe lease is up next year
2022-08-01,PistonHeads,we have onegood bitslooks greatdecent interior for the price but climate controls only through the screenquite efficient 45mikwh in summerreasonably decent to drive never goign to be a hot hatch but its nippy off the lineworks well on rapid chargers doesnt take too long to fill up to 80bad bitsits a right lemon and have had paint faults misaligned panels and doors and a charger fault peugeot customer service is awful everything takes ages to fixback seats and boot are really pokey compared to a dedicated ev
2022-08-01,PistonHeads,got the e208 gt premium for my wife and had it around 1 12 yearsgreat little reliable runaround the only 2 issues weve encountered is it occasionally gets km and miles mixed up for service notifications and app use and the motorway range isnt great at around 120 miles 100 to give yourself a safety buffer

2023-05-31,PistonHeads,sorry if i seem to come out like a pedant but i think the beauty of such cars comes from how they are an electric conversion wont make it much more usable than it is and youd loose some of the uniqueness of the car im getting old and nostalgic

2023-05-31,PistonHeads,this guy will give you some idea of the efforts needed to retrofit an electric solution into a classic carhttpswwwyoutubecomelectricclassiccarsid say 40k is quite reasonable for the amount of kit and effort required even if it looks out of place in regard to the perceived value of the car
2023-05-31,PistonHeads,is there then an issue upon ev conversion around major changes to the vehicle that trigger an inspection that any car older than a couple of years cant pass due to regsone idea would be for a small universal electric platform from the likes of lotus that you can then drop any body onto to create a completed car take your pick from an elise dino fiat 500 etc the original esprit especially would definitely make a fantastic ev

,PistonHeads,the best road trip car in my oppinion is by definition not the best road trip cardrive to italy in a modern audimehi did it in my capri but even better why not do it in a caterhamor a morris ital estatethis best road trips ive done were in a citroen saxo and a nissan micra while the volvo 850 i used to have was perfect for long journeys it just ate them up it would make 1000 miles feel like a trip to the shops not an adventure if the car is to become part of the trip it has to have character which means it needs to be more flawed than almost all the suggestions on hereif i were to endore a best however it would definitely be the result of a substantial amount of alcohol five hundred pounds and an ebay account its almost certain to give more of a story than a v70 t5 or an m5 or suchlike
,PistonHeads,that looks smart thanks the black flatters the size of the v70 i love mine to bits feel absolutely no desire for mercs or bmws maybe an rs6 but who am i kidding i could never afford to run itmine also seems to hide the fact that its done almost 100000 miles quite well not a single rattle or squeak just a few tiny chips on the nose to give the game awayvolvo for life
,PistonHeads,this best road trips ive done were in a citroen saxo and a nissan micra while the volvo 850 i used to have was perfect for long journeys it just ate them up it would make 1000 miles feel like a trip to the shops not an adventure if the car is to become part of the trip it has to have character which means it needs to be more flawed than almost all the suggestions on hereif i were to endore a best however it would definitely be the result of a substantial amount of alcohol five hundred pounds and an ebay account its almost certain to give more of a story than a v70 t5 or an m5 or suchlikethisive done it several times now and its turned every roadtrip into an adventure instead of a mere drive through europeyoull learn about the many many uses of ducttapeyoull also get the answer to important questions you never knew you had how far can you get without a working clutch pedal at least 3500 miles do you really need third gear no you dont can you drive a car with a broken cooling system during a heatwave yes but at no more than 63mph
,PistonHeads,doesnt fit the criteria but 1170 miles in one day from le mans to rijeka in croatia at the wheel of thisnever faltered never a moments worry and great fun however that was seven years back i think id want something more comfortable and with aircon to repeat the exercise now

,PistonHeads,in 92 i did a us roadtrip in one of thesevery comfy for the 5 of us and about 4000 miles in 3 weeks

2023-08-21,PistonHeads,although lucy almost certainly accurate with braking distances the reason the highway code hasnt changed regarding stopping distances is simpleweight1953 morris minor circa 790kg2023 ferrari circa 1500kgtwice the weight to stopam i the only one old enough to have immediately thought drum brakes my brother had a moggie minor a few years ago braking was similar to the way he played golf hit and hopehe rarely exceeded 35 mph for this reasonhowever this one belongs to a friend of mine and is blessed with a 4 litre v8 tvr engine and jaguar running gear including brakeshighly amusing when he boots it on the dual carnageway
2023-08-21,PistonHeads,be serious weight is irrelevant because it has been taken into account are you seriously suggesting that from 70 mph a 2023 ferrari sf90 stradale which weighs quite a lot more than a morris minor wont stop in a much shorter distance than a 1953 morris minor on cross plys with drum brakes by that argument a minor would stop in a shorter distance than an f1 car because it weighs less than a current f1 cari absolutely assure you that the minor would not stop before the sf90 or a current f1 car the extra distance that the minor took would be laughablethe highway code is massively out of date with regard to stopping distances
2023-08-21,PistonHeads,was it fifth gear several years ago that did an article on braking distancesthey marked out the highway code braking distances then proceeded to trash them by a considerable amount using modern machinery the highway code distances were laughable compare to what a modern car can achievemodern cars fitted with developed braking systems and fitted with good quality rubber can stop in a ridiculously short distance no question

,PistonHeads,he doesnt exactly have the easiest job in the world though does he if hed taken a job in the south east hed be able to deliver but walesone of the newspapers is reporting today about how downtrodden rhyl is someone says that it is like blackpool after a nuclear attack i assume that haydn is responsible for delivering on regeneration there too ciner glass is still going ahead possibly on a smaller scale but with the same number of jobs smaller scale because of the world economic situation and energy prices as recycling glass uses a fair amount of energy planning was granted no obstacted from haydns teamhaydns team didnt put any obstacles in the way of ineos either its just that when there is a modern merc factory and a trained workforce ready to go its hard to ignore the attraction of that and ineos didntthe circuit of wales was just a pipe dream but haydns team ran with it found money for desktop surveys did everything to facilitate ithaydns team couldnt have been more fair or accommodating with tvr either but unless he nationalises tvr then their coffers will remain insufficient get the job done
,PistonHeads,and just another word on stopping distancesthe highway code says that the braking distance not the thinking distance which is in addition from 70mph is 75 metres recently autocar are tested an arbarth 500e essentially a sporty electric fiat 500 it weighs 1400kg and the tested stopping distance from 70mph was 446 metres that is a heavy little electric car no carbon ceramic brakes no 20 inch wheels with space for massive discs and calipersthat shows how out of date the highway code is
,PistonHeads,and an ev of the same size would somehow not be too fat for country lanes or too fat for car parks the point i made quite clearly was that i didnt see any reason to have an inefficient vehicle as a daily driver on the basis that it will occasionally towbecause its a 30mpg diesel range rover thats inefficient which himself runningcosts were a consideration too fat for country lanes too fat for car parks and has a rattly diesel engine up frontyou made a few points quite clearly just as you look stupid when you cant quote a whole because its a 30mpg diesel range rover thats inefficient which himself runningcosts were a consideration too fat for country lanes too fat for car parks and has a rattly diesel engine up frontand yet harry justifies it on the basis he has to tow stuff i bow down to your knowledge of looking stupid you have made an art form of it in thread after thread
,PistonHeads,few things here rrs d300 is my own personal choice of family car im not saying its the best out there i just like the look i was keen to find a 23 model car without the speed safety nonsense and still with manual heater controls and actual buttons and have a good local dealer the other issue today is if youre looking for a diesel in 202324 theres very little choice beyond lr product available today re being a farmer and making this a business purchase that would be great if you could actually make a profit from farming the farm struggles to make a profit most years so the last thing i need is yet another cost to set against the farms measly output pitching for a longtermer could have worked but they are generally only for 6 months and theres often compromises to consider mr clarkson has never accepted a longtermer during his career in motor journalism simply on principle and i have always admired thatthen the terms of my finance deals on my own personal cars will and always will remain private i used the pcp deals taken from the lr website in this video as a simple way to show the differences in monthly cost between the various examples i used theres no way i would ever choose a disco 5 as its as fugly as the x5 is and i wouldnt be seen dead in one i hate them with a passion but have always admired the disco 3 and 4 as being proper workhorses but again ive no desire to actually own onethanks never thought the d5 was that bad

,PistonHeads,bloody hell harry some recent videos have really upset some of evangelists on here first you called out the bmw ithrust 60 xdrivel eagle msport for what it was and now youve bought a diesel with your own money
,PistonHeads,can i just say i dont think there are any evangelists there are just people responding to bullstas always there is resistance to change never more so than from old men though im not putting harry in that categoryfor whatever reason there are some topics where bullst gains clicks indeed there are multiple youtube channels dedicated to utter bullst about evsdiscussing or responding to bullst doesnt make one an evangelist be the topic about evs or cycling europe lewis hamilton or whatever
,PistonHeads,i love the discussion and i like the pragmatic view that harry had laid his decision out there are a few factors that i feel people are running with that are overlooked this is only for someone like harry who is buying a brand new range rover and you live in da countryside yes i can agree with harry he uses the rr for long journeys and that is also why i have my ye olde 2010 q7 tdiyou could also be doing the same man maths on a 2023 992 turbo being over supplied or depreciating like a stone but that is another discussion but the same distorted platform of supply and demand being set by the supplier of the product in britain not the government why didnt harry test his own hybrid range rover knowing his own case use the uk government specifically made an ev tax break and did not set a limit or cap on it many other countries have set a luxury tax upper limit so you dont get more off the more you spend i also think harry is distorting his own ownership as being your ownership pointing to 12 sports cars in a shed as the antidote to speed as though this is the general public most people own 0713 cars per household and most people dont drive as a hobby i would also question the idea that these luxury evs or a hybrid are all lemons all of the factors that harry points out on the used ev market over supply dealers only wanting to sell new cars not used ones means that a bargain can be had not because the car itself is poor

,PistonHeads,hi all wife has just bought a fiat 500e which comes with a 3 pin charging lead but it takes forever to chargehowever it also has a type 2 cable in the boot too male at one end female at the other presumably for charging at a public charger is there anything stopping me buying one of these and connecting it to a 32amp breaker on my consumer unitor do i actually need a charger leadthanks all
,PistonHeads,you could either get a commando socket installed and use an adaptor or different charging lead or get a conventional ev charger installed and use the supplied cable3pin socket will give you 10amps 21kw commando 16amp 35 or maybe 32amp ev charger will give you 32amp 74kw rough figuresive not done it but understand that a commando socket is quite a bit cheaper to install
,PistonHeads,wont work the car needs to communicate with the charger before it will accept charge theres a lot of electronics behind the female socket of a home charger to achieve that communication between car and charger what you have linked to is just the socket component of what would become a chargerthe 3 pin cable you already use has the same electronics in the brick mid cableyou need a 7kw home charger installing id do so sooner rather than later whilst grants remain a 7kw charger will fully charge almost any ev overnight with ease
,PistonHeads,but the car wont accept the charge will it lol just deleted my comment im not so sure i read a lot about commando sockets before getting my ohme installed and i assumed it would charge and use the cars software to judge the ratelevel etc but in the end i spent the cash on an ohme and forget everything i had learnt about other methodshowever i think it will but this baseless
,PistonHeads,if you want to use a 32a commando type socket youll need an ev charging cable equipped with the box of electronics that tells the car it has up to 7kw available i believe it should also check that the vehicle is earthed before allowing charging to commencesomething like thishttpsevonestopcoukproductsevchargingcable
,PistonHeads,you can get a commando to type charging cable but there is not much of saving unless you already have a 32a commando installed and you dont get the grant unless you install a proper ev charger
,PistonHeads,to charge at 7kw youll need to buy a 32a charger that has a socket or a tethered cable thatll charge about 3x the speed of the 3pinthe chargerevse install is for all intents and purposes a job for a sparks itll need certification registration with the electricity supplier maybe some meter box works correct earthing design etc expect to pay 5600 for an installed unit after the grant
,PistonHeads,what are your daily usage requirememts op weve run an i3 tesla model 3 and now an etron 55 over the past 3 years on 3pin plug for 99 of charging and have covered 30k miles in that timeyou should get 10mph of charge on a 3pin plug in a 500e so an easy 100 miles overnight

,PistonHeads,surely you knew when you started the thread whether or not the current charging speed was fast enoughanyway yes for 3050 miles a day just use the three pin itll do over 100 miles in a night easy if you want to save some its also worth asking your electricity supplier about cheap overnight tariffslots of people assume theyll need a dedicated charger when very few of them do the mileage that would require it if they have access to a 3pin socket
,PistonHeads,they are a supply a big relay and a bit of electronics inside to tell the car when to take power and how much some have telemetry inside and some have intelligent ways to handle earthneutral faults imo they are ridiculously overpriced for what they dowere currently charging two evs off a single 13a supply and its a bit fiddly but no problem for our daily mileage about 40 miles per day
,PistonHeads,well i am confused as after watching that youtube video above it implies that these wall chargers arent actually chargers but just a supply the car has the charger onboardim confusedcom so will just stick with the 3 pin for nowthey are just a supply a dedicated unit will just be able to provide more power than a 3pin and charge the car quickerfor a 500e a 3pin supply will provide enough power to charge at a rate of 10 miles of range added per hour a 7kw dedicated unit will provide enough power to charge at a rate of 31 miles of range added per hour the onboard charger takes that supply and charges the battery

,PistonHeads,well i am confused as after watching that youtube video above it implies that these wall chargers arent actually chargers but just a supply the car has the charger onboardim confusedcom so will just stick with the 3 pin for nowin fairness before i found myself considering an ev i had assumed they just needed a basic power cord the fatter the cable and beefier the supply the better and the car can take what it needs i hadnt understood they need to talk to the supply point to instigate any charging at all or that they had on board chargers with their own limitationsbut as others for almost all drivers daily needs the three pin is easily sufficient if you can install a 7kw i would advise you do as it is quicker if you need it and also is an increasingly attractive addition to a house as and when you sell
,PistonHeads,2025 porsche 718 boxster ev latest spy shots of the interior the interior pics also reveal 252 kilometers of driving range meaning 157 miles the slightly curved line under the 252 on the digital instrument cluster indicates a nearly full batterymore info athttpswwwautoevolutioncomnews2025porsche71
,PistonHeads,im no ev fan especially for sports cars but i assume the range would be calculated the same way as currently ie rag the car for a bit and the range will be shocking then recover as your driving settles downcould easily be something similar the driver was using all the power recently and depleted the range heavily
,PistonHeads,i cant see it having 160 miles of range thats hits not going to make it attractive at all the loons in the ev thread will be telling us that is plenty totally missing the point again that average mileage is irrelevant if you need to do one longer trip european tour
,PistonHeads,the loons in the ev thread will be telling us that is plenty totally missing the point again that average mileage is irrelevant if you need to do one longer trip european touri think thats just your imagination but we know there are quite a few fantasists on here i dont think ev suits sports cars maybe if all you do is pootle around locally but i did a few road trips to italy in my old boxster and ev would make that more difficult less spontaneous be interesting to see what this finally looks like the range and how it sells
,PistonHeads,the laptop ui wires all over the place and horrible dash covering will hit sales tooits a preprod car being tested you dont know what its just been doing what battery it is carrying or even whether those readouts on the dash are correct massive conclusion jumping
,PistonHeads,the laptop ui wires all over the place and horrible dash covering will hit sales tooits a preprod car being tested you dont know what its just been doing what battery it is carrying or even whether those readouts on the dash are correct massive conclusion jumpingwell there no way im buying a car that has a guy in chinos in the drivers seat how am i supposed to drive it when hes there
,PistonHeads,the laptop ui wires all over the place and horrible dash covering will hit sales tooits a preprod car being tested you dont know what its just been doing what battery it is carrying or even whether those readouts on the dash are correct massive conclusion jumpingbet the end result is not far off most of that interior looks refined ghastly but refined suspect they have completed tooling and what you see there is itas to the readouts its a full battery makes no odds of whats happened upto that point if it wasnt full sure they aint going to come out with a 500 range per charge what the picture suggests is very likely the end result in my opinionwhich seemingly looks like a 992taycan lovechild for the dash and centre column
,PistonHeads,i dont think ev suits sports cars maybe if all you do is pootle around locally but i did a few road trips to italy in my old boxster and ev would make that more difficult less spontaneous would agree with this the excess weight and limited range is not exactly conducive to track days eitherbut no doubt an ecoloon will be along shortly to tell us 225 the moon is always full and evs are the magic bullet
,PistonHeads,as other have echoed and frankly regardless of range i dont see the attractiveness of a bev sportscar i am puzzled as per why porsche is not running an ice version alongside to hedge their bets
,PistonHeads,2025 porsche 718 boxster ev latest spy shots of the interior the interior pics also reveal 252 kilometers of driving range meaning 157 miles the slightly curved line under the 252 on the digital instrument cluster indicates a nearly full batterydoesnt look to me like the battery gauge is showing a full charge not seeing a doesnt help based on the charge line design being symetrical germans like symmetry id say the full range is closer to 300350km though that dash and charge graphics look different to the taycanall the photo shows is that the cars current charge has a range of 252km left based on the driving style at the time
,PistonHeads,as other have echoed and frankly regardless of range i dont see the attractiveness of a bev sportscar i am puzzled as per why porsche is not running an ice version alongside to hedge their betsthey might do or at least have the car engineered to be able to do so if required like the fiat 500e
,PistonHeads,last year dealers had evidently been told there will be powertrain options likely to include electric hybrid andor ice may or may not still be the case but introducing a sports car as ev only would be a courageous move to borrow a euphemism from yes minister to repeat the taycan experiment would be a clear demostration of learning difficulties not they are not great but 2 very close colleagues have them and its a whole different new porsche ownership experience to my own both are extremely happy to have them on reduced tax salary sacrifice leases because the leasing company is almost definitely going to catch a cold when resale time comes whatever is in the range ill be really surprised if the electric version isnt the flagship with the highest performance
,PistonHeads,at what point will porsche realise pure performance speed and acceleration are not the hooks that buyers want the electric cayman boxster are just a more concentrated 4 cylinder sized issue for themim sure it will appeal to the many just not any of the purists and long term owners also do they have a plan b for us sales they seem less interested in electric cars and would want range as a buying point if the us is an expanding sales market it would be suicide to go down an electric only model range
,PistonHeads,i had my personal independence payment increased to include the mobility component a few months back and i have thought here and there about exchanging my allowance for a motability car but ultimately decided on the whole it was cheaper to keep and run my current privately owned car i am about to have to embark on some expensive maintenance including a new timing chain etc so ive been thinking again about going with a motability cari can not believe that the honda e base model is available with no advance payment and also you get help with having a home charger installed for 76 or whatever a week i think thats an incredible deal but ive never owned or even driven an electric car i like the honda brand and i think the e looks good outside and insidei dont do long journeys but i hear some reviews saying the range is very poor and the infotainment ui is bad wondering if anyone has experience with one and if it makes for a suitable first foray into electric vehicle ownership
,PistonHeads,i think youd be better have a few test drivesthe honda e for some reason not just the e it seems is more of a city car based on the range and one of the biggest issues is that the plethora of screens and cameras arent exactly sympathetic to the efficiency of the vehicle itselfthe stellantis peugeotcitroendsvauxhallfiat etc models are seemingly affected by aerodynamics and cold weather making them also slightly more angled to the city car category than the comfortable commuter they do however seem to have more traditional interiors if the jump to an ev is better suited to not also gaining a minimalistic or overlymodern interiori assume your mobility will have some suitability towards a certain type of vehicle so id definitely figure out what you can get then try and visit some showrooms before restrictions ramp up to see which charging ports are better for you honda e is at the front and can be fiddly id3 is like a traditional fuel flap and what interior spacelayout is best suitedonce you order youll still no doubt be waiting several months so it might not solve your current car issues

,PistonHeads,brilliant car to drive i loved it i only didnt get one as the range was a tad iffy for me and i could get a seat mii electric for a third of the lease cost per month
,PistonHeads,only reason i didnt buy an e when i test drove one was the range it just made things too restrictive for what i needed shame as otherwise it was an incredibly fun well finished cute little car that ticked every box more so than the up gti i ended up buying especially customer service wisethe honda dealership are great vw as dealerships and their organisation are disgraceful quite frankly
,PistonHeads,the mg name doesnt conjure up anything for me and i just see it as a chinese electric car which i guess it isit is but they are arguably now the market leaders for evs whilst they were playing catchup for ice they have been producing arguably superior vehicles in their own markets at higher volumes than anyone would do in the uk or indeed europewhilst the mgs are indeed rebadged chinese vehicles from saic who make and sell millions of cars every year they seem to know what theyre doing with evs quite a few interesting fully charged reviews seem to back that upthe other brands that arent here yet are going to be very interesting the ora cat looks to be a good competitor in the honda e space and is coming to the uk next year but im looking forward to seeing the likes of xpeng bringing their models over if they doi cant help but feel like we as consumers are paying for the traditional fossilfuel brands to evolve their technology whereas thats not particularly the case with the new car companies that have set out to make evs granted there are various moral and social concerns around evs not lease the manufacturing of anything in china but it will be competition that makes everything affordable for the masses
,PistonHeads,it is but they are arguably now the market leaders for evs i cant help but feel like we as consumers are paying for the traditional fossilfuel brands to evolve their technology whereas thats not particularly the case with the new car companies that have set out to make evs market leaders well if they are they are hiding it extremely wellall manufacturers have the samesimilar set up costs and it is arguable that ice manufacturers will have a head start on the start ups with their vehicular experience an supply chain and the most financial muscle long term i can see a lot of these ev start ups disappearing in the next 20 years too
,PistonHeads,there are quite a number evs for sub 300 a month on lease these daysnot sure how motobility works but taking the cash and leasing personally might well open up further options and even save some moneyas for the e i quite like them the range issue isnt an issue at all so long as its enough anyway
,PistonHeads,market leaders well if they are they are hiding it extremely wellall manufacturers have the samesimilar set up costs and it is arguable that ice manufacturers will have a head start on the start ups with their vehicular experience an supply chain and the most financial muscle long term i can see a lot of these ev start ups disappearing in the next 20 years toothat sounds like the start of the tesla will disappear threadtheyre hiding nothing its simply a case of exposure and ignorance in this corner of the world there are teslas made in china alongside 29 other makers the reality is that companies who made the batteries like byd have found its rather simple to just make cars instead when thats where a lot of the costprofitcomplexity isthe basic maths of it is that there are 14 billion people in china which is double the total population of europe currently were the smaller market so they dont need to export their brand or products to get a significant jump start
,PistonHeads,there are quite a number evs for sub 300 a month on lease these daysnot sure how motobility works but taking the cash and leasing personally might well open up further options and even save some moneyas for the e i quite like them the range issue isnt an issue at all so long as its enough anywayyou get about 6250 or so a week for your mobility needs so you can use it for public transporttaxis etc or you can forego the money and select a car instead some cars need an advance payment say for example 1500 for a 1 series bmw but quite a lot of cars dont need any down payment any optional extras or paint finishes have to be paid upfront too the main thing is that you really literally only need to add fuel screenwash etc insurance servicing road fund license breakdown cover and even tyres are all included its worth mentioning that motability itself is a charity but the money for the cars comes from an individuals benefit entitlement considering disabled people used to have to drive those awful tridents plastic pigs i think its one thing successive governments can be proud ofrange really is not an issue for me the longest journey i do is from luton to stevenage back which is 30 miles all round i could probably charge a honda e once a week and be good for mileage seems the popular opinion thus far is that if the range isnt an issue then its the one to have i just watched some youtube videos of that mini cooper hitting 60 in around 6 and a half seconds thoughi think the e is certainly the trendiest and funkiest of them all and i know some dont like it but i think that interior is pretty sweet just hope the seats and my spine can manage to strike a deal
2021-12-31,PistonHeads,i test drove the mini and hondathe mini ride is pretty firmthe honda ride is sublime imothank you for telling me this i know the honda e has fully independent suspension just like it was on my old civic i always found that to be a fantastic in terms of ride and handling i dont like firm riding cars because 99 of the time my driving is purely for necessity its not worth a sporty suspension for that rarest of opportunities to enjoy drivingcan i ask how you found the lack of door mirrors are the mirror screens an easy transition ive seen reviews say the cameras repel rain well enough and the blind spot detection is goodim going to book s test drive in the new year but im glad ive asked for advice from phers to rule out any immediate deal breakers i adore the 70s civic callbacks to the design too
2021-12-31,PistonHeads,market leaders well if they are they are hiding it extremely wellall manufacturers have the samesimilar set up costs and it is arguable that ice manufacturers will have a head start on the start ups with their vehicular experience an supply chain and the most financial muscle long term i can see a lot of these ev start ups disappearing in the next 20 years toodo you have any knowledge of what youre talking aboutif so youre hiding that extremely well saic are absolutely huge and have been for a lot longer than theyve been producing evs theyre a force to be reckoned with theyve made millions of cars per year for a very long time so im sure they know what theyre doing there are a few startups about saic arent one of them
2021-12-31,PistonHeads,the honda e is an excellent car the entertainment system is one of the best on the market only rivalled by volvo really it fully supports android auto and apple carplay if you prefer to use those systems tooits very easy to drive especially in one pedal mode its easy to park with an incredibly small turning circle its comfortable i have some mobility issues and find it easy to get in and out of the screens that replace the mirrors are very good you need to turn your head less for the side ones i find that a rear view mirror often needs to be adjusted as my body compresses a bit in the evenings but with a digital one no adjustment is neededthe only issue you might have is no arm rest but you can buy one as an extra and have the dealer fit it oh and the boot is very small too make sure your equipment fits in there or use the back seatsas for range 80 miles in all conditions more like 100110 in the summer obviously only you know if that is adequate for you for longer trips you can of course charge it up in about 30 minutes on a rapid charger which you can find at every motorway service station and many other places the zap map website is good for checking chargers on the routes you frequently use and a better route planner will allow you to see how practical your journeys arepersonally i had a nissan leaf 24 and 30 the 30 has about the same range as the honda e and it was fine for me even the 24 was no problem in fact i loved that car
2021-12-31,PistonHeads,i test drove the honda and a load of others its definitely the car to have if you like gadgets i didnt think i would like the video mirrors but the door cameras are brilliant one of those things that is just so much better than the old way the interior mirror i didnt like in video mode but it selectable as a conventional mirroras other the weak point is the range it was below 100 miles within minutes and its hard to get away from what seems to be a very rapid move towards empty one general point to make is that the whole ev experience is very dependent on the app and software it has taken every manufacturer including tesla a couple of years to work out how to do it and to educate the dealerships i would avoid owning the first ev from any manufacturer or dealer for at least two years unless you really enjoy the early adopterbeta tester experience
2021-12-31,PistonHeads,had one 5 mths and sold it as an experienced ev owner wit family car a tesla m3 and my town car having been an early zoe circa 2017 followed by 2x i3son paper the honda was perfect for my london commuting needs it proved to be annoying app remote heating and similar functions never worked and the phone link satnav etc was generally poor some of the features were gimmicky eg the video rear view mirror it drove perfectly well the usual recipe of swift silent and gregarious in a small ev the collision avoidance stuff was awful and the main reason i sold it driving in the cut and thrust of slow moving rush hour traffic it would regularly insist you were about to crash slam on the brakes and disable the controls for a few seconds which felt very long when you were then stuck across a junction or roundabout intrusive to the point of dangerous in summary just not as good a user experience as the faultless i3 and the range was awful even as a city car needed plugging in at least every other day with a daily commute 11km each way
2021-12-31,PistonHeads,we have a mazda mx30 which has a real world range of 100 miles in winter it has proved a revelation as a daily driver to a degree that we have much much more expensive evs on order and im wondering why im actually buying something else that expensive when this does such a good job other than rangethe mazdas came about by accident wed orderd a pair of evs through our business the expensive ones tax reasons etc i was offered such a large amount of money for my existing audi due to the shortage of second hand cars that it would have been daft not to sell it so that left me with a two seater sports car a large dog and a partner who uses a wheelchair i need a runabout till the audi replacement arrivedi was looking at shed of the week type estates that used to be around the 1500 markthat were now 5000 or so given the sillyness of the used car market so on a whim i looked at cheap ev leasesafter going to a broker and about 6 cars in asking about lead times and availablity we changed tack and asked the broker what was available in stock for immediate delivery mazda mx30s was the answer so having googled them and figuring out the range was around 100 miles which seemed to be putting off most people we ordered twoas a daily driver shopping car dog car town car going to the gym car i just cant fault it the dashboard bleeps at me a lot for reasons im not sure why as ive still not bothered to figure out how to turn it all on or offthe funky door designs are a revelation for disabled access the front doors open 90 degress wide and provide huge access the seat height is bum height so you just slide in and out very easy to use nice specification as standardgo and try one it might be perfect for you with the added bonus that theres likely to be stock you can have at short noticei did check and at least one model is available on motability with 0 down the others are no more than 500 up front for extra bits but if you ask me the less alarms and assistance systems that you have the better edited by 21ats on friday 31st december 2047
2021-12-31,PistonHeads,i would of loved a honda e but the range was a non starter for me wife has a fiat 500e la prima which is similar value to the honda but does a real world range of 140 miles not quite as a good as my old i3saying all that i drive a leaf 62 as i got an absurdly good lease deal through work so sometimes the cons can be outweighed by the cheap costs
2022-01-01,PistonHeads,the funky door designs are a revelation for disabled access the front doors open 90 degress wide and provide huge access the seat height is bum height so you just slide in and out very easy to use nice specification as standardthis is well worth repeating i forgot to mention it hondas usually have very wide opening doors but the e is exceptional the ability to kind of step in is really good too no swinging down low or pulling yourself up to get out
,PistonHeads,we have a 2019 first edition kia eniroa couple of months ago my wife returned from a local shop to find after she had parked that she couldnt get out of the carshe struggled trying to turn the car off and on the car was dead but eventually she found that her drivers side window would open so climbed out through the window and plugged the car in she was then late for another arrangement and so left the car to sort itself outthe following day i discovered the problem and found that the drivers door would open from the outside but the car was deadi pulled out the thick drivers manual and couldnt find anything about a dead batteryi phoned the kia dealer from whom we had bought the car and was told to charge the auxiliary battery i was also asked if the car had a restart the battery switch if it has i cant find it so i opened the bonnet from inside the car and found that the auxiliary battery was reading 4v and i therefore put this on a 5amp charger some hours later i came back to the car it did appear to be charging but the battery voltage was still around 5 volts so i phoned the dealer and asked to speak to a technician apparently this was not possible and i was advised to arrange to have the car recovered which i guess could have been complicated since it was locked in park and plugged into the main battery chargeri figured that either something had discharged the auxiliary battery or this had failed but why wouldnt it charge maybe the charger was sensing a fault or maybe there was a discharge equating to the charge current so i decided to remove the battery to charge it but at the sane time i decided to find collect and fit a new replacement battery there was one at dealership 20 miles away once connected the car sprung back into life and incidentally the old battery still appears to be holding a good charge 127 volts as of now and not touched since charged fully following the lockoutso i tried to get in touch with kia customer service asking to speak with a technician with whom i could share my experience no interest talk to your supplying dealer was the best they could muster then i receive a questionnaire asking about my experience with kia customer care which i of course panned and following which i have heard nothingsince this time amongst family and friends i have discovered two other kia owners who have suffered similar problems being locked in or locked outhow will this problem ever be solved unless the manufacturer will communicate in order to analyse the issue and coordinate at least an action plan to deal with the immediate consequences and then an ownerfix which does not involve recovering the car at great expense inconvenience and possibly collateral damage so have you been locked in your ev if so what happened and how was the problem solved this could be a life threatening issue
,PistonHeads,mr does the car not have a mechanical override that opens the doori thought that was mandatory in case the car is submerged etc i have a fiat 500e as a temp hire and it has electric door releases but a manual lever at the base of each door
,PistonHeads,in reply1 no emergency door release that i could find i found the emergency charge cable release will look again but kia never mentioned it2 yes the battery has been replaced but the old one appears to hod a reasonable charge and discharge tested ok3
,PistonHeads,in reply1 no emergency door release that i could find i found the emergency charge cable release will look again but kia never mentioned it2 yes the battery has been replaced but the old one appears to hod a reasonable charge and discharge tested ok3 did you disconnect both contacts from the battery ahead of getting the 4v reading if so its definitely not a healthy battery on some levelas for the door lock thing i just googled and cant find a thing thats bizarre there has to be a manual release for safety imo id call kia uk and be a bit more pushy
,PistonHeads,not an ev but i got locked in my 2012 merc slk and had to lower the roof and climb out not battery related but some thing to do with a component in the door mechanism that had stretched so pulling the interior handle would not release the door not ideal in an emergency situation merc it was quite common evs may bring some new scenarios with them but older cars arent immune either
,PistonHeads,being locked in is quite common on vw group cars with keyless locking usually the driver gets out to pop into a shop or whatever and absently mindedly locks the car while his missus is still in it the car deadlocks and the doors cant be opened from the insidetheres a post on a seat ateca forum today where someone managed to lock himself in his car in his garage as the battery died but oddly he was able to open a rear door which he shouldnt have been able to

,PistonHeads,there must be a manual way to open from a safety perspective perhaps for security purposes kia will not respond directly in case of random theft so they refer you back to the dealershipso try asking your dealership from whom you bought the car if there is a manual opener then they should be able to helpi would like to know the answer because potentially kia would be my preferred ev purchase but not if this is a safety risk
,PistonHeads,exactly same scenario as op in my 4 month old ev6 currently sat on drive as dead as a doornail 12v battery will not hold any charge as soon as charger is disconnected the car is totally dead rac wont do anything but jumpstart it and dealer is not returning calls no way im getting in it as there appears to be no way out if the battery is dead 7 year warranty my arse
,PistonHeads,as others have pointed out i dont really see why it would be anything to do with it being an ev the doors work the same
,PistonHeads,i would google specific to the kia ev as it is probably an isolated fault on that specific car you may get better results if your thread title is car specific
,PistonHeads,as others have pointed out i dont really see why it would be anything to do with it being an ev the doors work the same in my tvr t350 it is possible to be locked in due to the contact points having rust or moved out of place due to flexing of the body there is a button to open the door which triggers a motor to unlock however there is a manual cable which you can pull to open the door its an emergency cable because once used it takes a bit of fiddling to reset the cablein my other cars its always been a mechanical function you pull the door handle lock and it opens the latchi wouldnt know whether keyless entry cars would have the same issue as ev though
,PistonHeads,exactly same scenario as op in my 4 month old ev6 currently sat on drive as dead as a doornail 12v battery will not hold any charge as soon as charger is disconnected the car is totally dead rac wont do anything but jumpstart it and dealer is not returning calls no way im getting in it as there appears to be no way out if the battery is dead 7 year warranty my arsei did not disconnect the battery before checking the voltage or putting the battery on charge for a couple of hours the voltage was still around 5v after the few hours in chargei think for some reason there is a heavy load which prevents all else from working i simply fitted a new battery but in doing so disconnected the old battery which may have reset the car i dont believe the 2019 eniro has a battery reset button certainly i couldnt find it in the cars handbook and kia could not tell me where it is ridiculously the handbook does tell you how to jump start the car asif it is a petrol model edited by chrisw on friday 4th august 1807
,PistonHeads,ridiculously the handbook does tell you how to jump start the car asif it is a petrol model edited by chrisw on friday 4th august 1807 ive had to jump 2 evs and a phev actually because of dead 12v batteries you need the juice to close the contactorlooks like the reason youve got stuck is that the 12v battery had died surely this can only be because the battery is faulty of the dc dc battery charger is deadwe had an eniro die at work probably because something was left on in the car battery was down at 7v jumped it and it started then measured 14v on the battery so it was charging is this the case in yoursid definitely be changing the battery its well within the realms of a diy job
,PistonHeads,thats how i solved the problemi replaced the battery with a new one from kia york the alternative suggested by the supplying dealer was getting the car recovered to themthough not necessarily a factor the negative connector to the battery did appear to be a little corroded so i also cleaned that up with emory paperi appreciate that the original battery will have been damaged but it does appear now to be holding a charge hence the question what happened that my wife had to climb out of the window when she had just been out to the shops and why wouldnt the battery charge on the car which brought me back to the idea of some very heavy load that dropped the voltage so far and was taking the charge from the 5 amp charger maybe disconnecting the battery completely to replace it was actually the cure in that it forceturned everything off edited by chrisw on saturday 5th august 1230

2022-12-21,PistonHeads,as petrol engines are phased out will lower end consumers just be priced out apart from the oldest models potentially with battery range issuesfor the next decade or so anyway yes in that time theres not going to be a 1000 runabout ev like the ice equivalents were going to have to get used to dearer ev cars at the lower end nobody will be worse off as the residuals of evs are higher

,PistonHeads,i dont really see what the headline purchase price has to do with anything anyway all that matters is the depreciation during ownership and the cost of financing that periodi really wish more of the electric cars are irrelevant toys for wealthy business owners mob could get their heads round thisif for example a model y costs 60k to buy new and you can get 52k for it after three years the total cost of ownership is only eight grand rather than sixtyobviously this applies to all new cars not just bevs but bevs are enjoying particularly low depreciation at the momentwhich is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future

,PistonHeads,and i dont mean the cars that are supposed to be fastwatching the carwow review of the smart 1 stupid namewhy does it have 270bhpi had a eqb the other week when my car was in the dealers and honestly for what it was it felt needlessly quick due to the availability of the torque combined with no engine noise it isnt any more torque than my 220d e classsurly they should just reduce the output of the motors and increase range people we know are getting a ix1 they have never had more than about 140bhp now they are going to 312bhp and 494nm and 60 is done in 56secondssurely 105 seconds is fine for something like that as thats what the 15litre engine can do it in
,PistonHeads,ice cars were always a compromise you couldnt build a powerful one that was economic or an economic one that was powerfulelectric cars are pretty much a software switch which limits the power you could put the worlds most powerful electric motor in a car and on a quiet run to the shops probably wouldnt be much less efficient than a very small one i dont think the cost of building them would be much different either certainly not compared to the differences required in icebut between you and reality is a bunch of salespeople designed to function in the last century and buyers for that matterthey are selling a consumer product and they are pretty much telling the producers what performance figure to put on the packaging that will sell the product but not destroy the future sales of incrementally faster carsthere are currently massive downsides to electric cars and the power figures need to balance that which is why to convince joe public to buy them they are all coming out a bit faster than the previous iteration of ice plus an extra power figure on top to make joe forget about the problems of charging range anxiety and general blandness
,PistonHeads,surly they should just reduce the output of the motors and increase range people we know are getting a ix1 they have never had more than about 140bhp now they are going to 312bhp and 494nm and 60 is done in 56secondssurely 105 seconds is fine for something like that as thats what the 15litre engine can do it in yep for my daily i wouldnt give a st that it could do 5s to 60 what i do give a st about is that i could plug it in once a week and do a commute everydayi guess theyre trying to make evs cool by being porschebeating insert your own brandid rather have an ev that did 8s to 60 but had a 1000 mile range the range needs to be much bigger than a diesel to take into account the moronic time it takes to charge up even the best ev 20 minutes is stupidly long a boring diesel can get a 600 mile range in 5 minutes including the time it takes to payadd the fact that it now costs the same to charge an ev in a public charging bay as it does a family hatchback or you have to put up with an 8 hour home charge overnight lets pause to think how many times youve set off for work and realised you forgot to plug your phone in overnight so it has 10 charge when you pick it up in the morning edited by hoofy on wednesday 16th august 1232
,PistonHeads,its a selling point especially in the early days of evs when teslas were marketing their cars they had to have a selling point over ice cars and acceleration was an easy selling point to make over in the states with lower gas prices i guess there was less of a difference in cost per mile when comparing petrol and electric so i guess they went with acceleration as the main selling pointcarwow seem to just do drag races as filler between car reviews i used to watch them but got tired of it after awhile now other manufacturers and review channels also give airtime to other more practical aspects of ev ownership which is probably more important to the general buying public
,PistonHeads,its much much easier to make a 1000hp ev than it is to make a 10 miles per kwh ev
,PistonHeads,would love to see a honda insightvw xl1 style ev unfortunately it wouldnt sell energy is way too cheap buyers way too conservative
,PistonHeads,my understanding is that the difference in electricity consumption per mile at cruising speed between a large motor and a small one is miniscule a powerful electric car therefore doesnt lose range by virtue of simply being powerful with the corollary that a weedy electric car doesnt gain range simply by being weedy there isnt anything in particular to be gained by making electric cars less powerful so companies generally dont a better motor might cost a grand or two more per car but thats not really a problem when consumers are prepared to pay that people will either want the additional performance or will be ambivalent to its presence a much harder sell would be a very slow electric car that doesnt go any further than a fast one and costs almost the same vauxhalls appear to have had that problem with the electric hatchbacks
,PistonHeads,so much lack of understanding surrounding this issuetheyre not fast because they need to be or because its the only way to sell them although it definitely helps in some potential buyers eyes of coursetheyre fast because they can be it costs the manufacturer and driver next to nothing in terms of upfront or running costs or range the downsides of all that power are so minimal that you might as well let em ave it for any drivers that happen to like it for most drivers its just bloody useful to be able to dart rapidly into a gap on a busy roundabout etcbigger batteries equal more range the size of the motors fitted only determine the speed at which that battery can be depleted drive a 500hp 2 tonne ev in the exact manner you would drive a 200hp 2 tonne ev and the range will be about the same allowing for aerodynamic and rolling resistance differences of coursethere is a weight and cost penalty when you get to a dual motor evs because youre dragging around the weight and cost of an extra motor but such cars are performance models and are supposed to appeal in terms of speed and power even then the actual range impact of the extra motor weight is very little if driven gently ie a tm3 single motor might cost 65 to do 200 miles a tm3lr dual motor might cost 750
,PistonHeads,so much lack of understanding surrounding this issuetheyre fast because they can be it costs the manufacturer and driver next to nothing in terms of upfront or running costs or range apart from the extra weight and cost of the wheels tyres brakes and anything else that needs upgrading to cope with the extra bhp there is a weight and cost penalty when you get to a dual motor evs because youre dragging around the weight and cost of an extra motor but such cars are performance models and are supposed to appeal in terms of speed and power even then the actual range impact of the extra motor weight is very little if driven gently ie a tm3 single motor might cost 65 to do 200 miles a tm3lr dual motor might cost 750or to put it another way you can increase the range by about 15 by avoiding the dual motor 4wd version im fed up with reading the new fandangomobile has a skateboard battery and the option of either one motor and 2wd or 2 motors and 4wd with the top model having 500bhp and a 062 time of 3 seconds how much cheaper lighter more spacious and more economical would it be if it wasnt designed and developed to cope with the demands of the top model
,PistonHeads,its much much easier to make a 1000hp ev than it is to make a 10 miles per kwh ev with ev powertrain typically having over 85 efficiency miles per kwh is dominated by vehicle lossesaero drag is the big one significant improvement requires even lower drag coefficient smaller frontal area and slower speeds or in other words very slippery small cars going slowly with these fundamental changes 10 miles per kwh ev is definitely achievable but you wouldnt like the product or using it better to go by train instead

2022-03-11,YouTube Comment,i own 1 i love it several people walked up to me to tell so cute and personality in abundance good for long distances as well 433 km and only 1 charge in 24 mins on a fast charger lets say a coffee break
2022-03-03,YouTube Comment,despite the occasionally annoying presentation style its a reasonable summary reasonable but not totally accurate as a very happy 500e owner i can offer the following range im only getting an average of 36 mileskwh so 144 miles and this is always using range mode for max regen and driving normally on a mix of road types driving is fun and the car is both nippy and confident my other car is a bmw i3 and the 500e actually tracks better interior i wasam pleasantly impressed with the build quality and most of the materials quality theres one of one exceptions but allinall its very good again my benchmark is a bmw practicality well its a fiat 500 for goodness sake and nobody should be expecting a tardis having said that its more than capable of taking our large weekly shop or carryon luggage for two again people its a city car specs i have the la prima model so topoftherange the specs are pretty amazing with very driver assistance gizmo you could wish for honestly the only thing missing is folding door mirrors but i guess the car is regarded as narrow enough for this to be a moot point i would definitely recommend people considering a city car ev to take one for test drive
2022-04-18,YouTube Comment,in my channel i reviewed the fiat 500e as well i can confirm you have a good point your points are valid i agree with you almost everywhere but there is one major flaw the price for that price we all have expectations i personally wouldve expected a tardislike experience if i were to pay beyond 30k euros for an asegment car for 30k one could get a csegment like a golf or astra car which is similar to the 500e in terms of city friendliness but more easy to live with
2022-06-14,YouTube Comment,autochampwandelen well price or more accurately value is all in the mind of the buyer for me i believe the 500e delivers much for the price i paid and the sales numbers reflect that this is a commonenough view the level of tech the impressive build quality and the sense of style all combine to deliver a valuable package a car purchase any car purchase is a discretionary spend so value is totally subjective
2022-06-14,YouTube Comment,autochampwandelen one more thing on price you mentioned golf and astra neither a pure ev platforms and so the comparison is moot additionally many of the legacy manufacturers when offering an ev version of their compromise vehicle architectures will spec and price the ev at the highest end of the range ice will be available with an entrylevel specprice but not the ev option fiat with the 500e do at least offer all termspecprice levels making the ev accessible to a broader customer base and that has to be a good thing

2022-02-21,YouTube Comment,way way over priced fiat originally brought out the 500 and designed it for people with average incomes now we are trying to get everyone in to evs fiat instead of building an ev for the average person brings out something for wealthier people 25k plus is way too pricey nah

2022-02-18,YouTube Comment,too expensive for such a small car with such a short battery range
2022-02-18,YouTube Comment,the car looks nice but i dont think a small car needs all the gadgets connectivity and infotainment they should keep them simple and efficient
2022-02-17,YouTube Comment,i bought a fiat 500e passion in rose gold two months ago and it is a belter of a car with bags of power great build quality and a brilliant driving experience particularly in onepedal drive mode it replaced a renault twingo gt which had identical dimensions so the boot and cabin are large enough for me and it also fits into my garage thanks to the piano keys that operate the hvac system the tablet remains off as i have no use for it and prefer to enjoy the pleasing sound of the electric motor
2022-04-24,YouTube Comment,hi brian how do you find the battery life to mileage and the charging time
2022-04-24,YouTube Comment,fc4660 hi f c over the winter i averaged about 38 miles per kwh in mixture of town and 5060 mph main road driving all with a light foot this has recently risen to 425 miles per kwh during early spring so range is now about 160 miles i have read that the fiat can be charged at 85 kw on public fast chargers but i have only ever used my home wallbox which is set very low to match my solar pv systems output so it is currently costing me very little to run hope this is of some help
2022-02-17,YouTube Comment,just not a fan of the fiat 500
2022-02-17,YouTube Comment,i drive a prima convertible in lhd formatlove it for what it is but there are some down pointsrhd conversion has not been done well it is a 22 range is great for city and day trips but it is not practical for any long range trips eg touring holidays mine is in a two car family and fits well but would i have got it as my only car probably not
2022-02-17,YouTube Comment,ive always liked the 500 and this is a good review but it captures in a nutshell the huge problem we have with evs right now price and range the most basic 500e is nearly 10k more than the entry petrol version thats 25k for a very small basic low range car and that climbs to 30k for a higher spec model thirty grand this is why evs are mostly being bought by the well off at the moment people who will always have a second ice car for longer journeys where theyre still way more practical were still 5 years or more away from sensibly priced evs with better battery tech
2022-02-17,YouTube Comment,buying on a contract and saving the difference between the petrol and ev version on fuel bills makes it cost effective
2022-02-17,YouTube Comment,jonwetherell5214 possibly with a very small car but this is the argument everyone makes buy on contract at this price though even with a moderate deposit youre looking at 3400 per month for a fiat 500e which is crazy kia ev6 midspec on pcp deal is around 7800pm this is just totally impractical for most average buyers especially with many now struggling just to keep the heating on and put food on the table with electicity prices soaring its also going to get more expensive to charge evs too
2022-02-23,YouTube Comment,jonwetherell5214 you having a laugh renting cars
2022-04-18,YouTube Comment,i also reviewed the fiat 500e in my channel and i can definitely confirm price and lack of options and practicality is an issue for that price you could get a csegment car that is more spacious and practical to live with and still as city friendly as the fiat 500e
2022-02-17,YouTube Comment,boot size is fine for most people tbh
2022-02-17,YouTube Comment,i still love my 2015 500c makes me happy every time i drive it
2022-02-16,YouTube Comment,nice car irritating presenter
2022-02-16,YouTube Comment,i love the 500 a small city car that is happy being a small city car great review much nicer interior quality and the specs are so good for what it is going to be used for although u are paying more now the 500 makes a great electric city car for the millions of people without loads of kids and large shopping trips etc because we do exist we need more manufacturers thinking like this
2022-02-16,YouTube Comment,nicola is again superbly delivering car reviews
2022-05-30,YouTube Comment,but she failed to mention a that strange push button gearbox b no handbrake for hill starts c gas pedal that stop and go without using the brake pedal which i hope there is a brake pedal must test drive one before i buy
2022-02-16,YouTube Comment,this car suits nicola so much ahaha love the reviews as per usual
2022-02-16,YouTube Comment,good review🙂 although im not sold on electric vehicles when we dont have enough charging points at the moment hybrid makes more sense when most cars take at least a few hours to charge the city charge points wont make sense this is why utility bills are going up trying to run before we can walk electricity isnt a greener energy source powercuts blackouts will be a regular occurrence
2022-02-16,YouTube Comment,this is a common misconception and the national grid disagrees with you two thirds of uk homeowners have access to a driveway and therefore a home charger they can charge at night making use of a currently under utilised electricity availability from wind power add in solar panels and storage from used ev batteries not to mention vehicletogrid where cars charge when prices are low and sell their cars electricity to the grid when prices are high and you can see there really is no shortage it is not why utility bills are going up you really need to do yourself a favour and google why they are going up the charging infrastructure could do with improvement though i agree with that
2022-02-17,YouTube Comment,not currently available in the uk unfortunately
2022-02-16,YouTube Comment,she showed the boot without showing the boot
2022-02-16,YouTube Comment,oh no you said you hate your car thats just a sure way of making her sulk on you 😟😟
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,love your reviews and amazing humour 😄🙏

2022-02-17,YouTube Comment,the electric powertrain
2022-02-17,YouTube Comment,carbuyer that has been out in december 2020
2022-02-17,YouTube Comment,mini gets a much shorter range but is more fun to drive the cupra is much more expensive
2022-02-17,YouTube Comment,carbuyer yes but i think its worth it i love the mazda mx30 as well
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,great review again my wife loves hers and the dog likes the back seat great fun to drive but if like me you have size 12 feet theres no room under the brake on uks rhd version you can buy a frunk insert for under the bonnet from a company in germany it carries the cable and a few bits cheers you should get fiat to give you one as a long termer httpsyoutubexi4qdkjgqnk
2022-03-03,YouTube Comment,thanks for the pointer to the frunk might look to get one i swapped out the domestic slow charger in the boot for a type 2 cable i never intend to charge at 2kwh while outandabout but i like how the frunk can also take some of the other roadside paraphernalia
2022-02-17,YouTube Comment,i really really like them looks great on this car
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,the car that saved fiat from bankruptcy
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,great review nicola fiat should consider a new electric panda
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,for a little bit more money you can get a tesla model 3 with nearly double the range better speed all the nice stuff and more i see the small size point but the car feels overpriced i assume the prices for model 3 will even fall once the berlin factory is running i think fiat still needs to level up a lot in order to be competitive
2022-02-17,YouTube Comment,if you actually go to the tesla website youll see the very cheapest tesla model 3 is 44990 purchase price the performance model the one with the good acceleration is 59990 these prices are before any optional extras are added thats not a bit more money
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,i went to guernsey in the summer the place is full of fiat 500s so this should go down well nicola get yours over there someone might take it off your hands
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,u tube have upped the number and length of time for adverts that i find it so hard to enjoy watching these videos shame as this was so informative and enjoyable to watch
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,i think this looks great and i hate the previous gen car 30k for a 500 is too much though
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,thank you for a great review nicola the new lights do indeed resemble eye lids and the lack of grille harks back to the original 500 that if i recall correctly had what seemed a spare engine in the boot an electric door release is form over function for an electric car though draining a few extra lumps from the battery may not be ideal id hope there is a clear manual release somewhere after all if your tired and pull over with the heater on and drop off into a deep snooze youll want to be able to get out when you wake up to err powder your nose the sherpa mode seems to have been around on cars for decades regularly driving on faster country roads i often find a stream of cars queueing behind a careful driver not that it bothers me that much honestly it doesnt bother me at all really im really not bothered ok i have to agree that horror jingle makes me shudder definitely at night if you live near a certain 24 hour fast food chain i loved the comment about moaning in the drivers ear how much you hate it in the rear of the car now as for sausage dogs i love em under breaking they might have a tendency to roll off end end up under the front seats and that dachshund extraction procedure can be an event in itself oh and i cant remember if you might have said that you have the older 500 but if it seems like massive difference in nearly all aspects to the review car remember your car has character and you should continue to love it even after a mild moan or tantrum
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,what a detailed comment love it oh and incase you were wondering i have a rear seat dog hammock thing which means theyre comfy and strapped in with their seatbelts thankyou for watching x
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,halogen headlights really fiat
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,i own the previous generation model in sport trim with the twinair engine and its an absolute hoot to drive so im definitely curious about what the electric model would offer should the time to move on from the twinair come and it looks promising smashing review
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,you should try it steven and let us know how you get on
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,and the hybrid has been described as the laziest hybrid in the sector with a 12volt battery under the passenger seat that wont do much other than allow fiat to put a hybrid badge outside
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,carbuyer great little car though i had the panda with the 12 engine and kept it for 10 years went everywhere in it basic motoring at its best fab review great to see the ev
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,thats all nice and cool but i feel like a dimension goes missing when they turned the 500 into an ev the sound from the engine i always thought it was kinda charming and funny sounding idk loving these reviews tho
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,ah we know what you mean especially that thrummy twinair engine but honestly you dont miss it at all
2022-02-16,YouTube Comment,carbuyer maybe not im not looking for an ev at the moment im way too emotionally invested with my volvo but i might go for a test drive in a 500 it looks fun
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,michelebicc6983 that begs the question of what the point of the button was in the first place
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,carbuyer hidden safety features are awesome
2022-02-15,YouTube Comment,great review thanks
2024-04-01,YouTube Comment,at 6 i was surprised with its space and seat comfort id buy one for its fun city manourvability id prefer no back seat but rather a platform with a couple of lockboxes as i have dogs id also like to see electric memory seats linked to the fobs as found in our honda crv as my wife i are not the same height cheers from nz
2024-02-22,YouTube Comment,the convertible section should have been designed to fold inside the boot door
2023-12-04,YouTube Comment,also worth noting of allllll the convertibles out there the fiat is the best combination of comfort and price i test drove every convertible available in usa under 75k none of them came close to the comfort of the fiat even the mazda miata is so low and tight fit that it would not be a comfortable choice for daily driver mustang and corvette are also uncomfortable add to that the typical ev is uggggggly and none of them come in convertible fiat 500 electricconvertible game changer
2023-10-25,YouTube Comment,october 2023 fiat 500e club on facebook the high voltages in an ev requires mechanics to have safety training and special equipment may be needed in fact my nearest fiat dealer cant service my la prima because of lack of training and equipment
2023-09-08,YouTube Comment,a prima version of this was parked next to my i3 just yesterday absolutely gorgeouslooking car 😎
2023-09-08,YouTube Comment,never have and never will like the fiat 500 in any form a truly awful car in my opinion
2023-09-07,YouTube Comment,it would be a perfect carif it had a normal engine
2023-09-07,YouTube Comment,we had the ice version a few years ago as a hire car and i cant explain how much fun it was fast no loud yes hilarious 100 i was apprehensive about using it as a hire car but after two weeks travelling about europe we were gutted to hand the keys back
2023-09-07,YouTube Comment,stunning little car and you have room in the boot for some shopping with your milk
2023-09-07,YouTube Comment,love the look of this car must have a reverse camera
2023-09-07,YouTube Comment,i just seen a 500e parked beside a 2000s nissan almera and the almera was smaller thats not good
2023-09-07,YouTube Comment,i swear cars are getting huge example nissan micra the name doesnt describe the car anymore
2023-11-26,YouTube Comment,duraeble2 inflated cars make better profits for shareholders more profits means more price hikes throughout the entire competition industry and market inflation reduces the value of profit margins and so the boulder tumbles
2023-05-05,YouTube Comment,hilariously i have driven this exact car was for sale at my old dealership i worked at small world
2022-06-14,YouTube Comment,well this video is noot actual any more because there is no action after 422 it is now called icon 22 and it is rather a cheap version of that new icon 22 it has the smaller battery but a lot of icon equipment so as the bigger screen the dab radio and the uconnect5 and there are more options than before to choose from for example the split back seat if i had known that before i might have waited because the old action was too poorly equipped it is now a better alternative than before the price has risen for about 1200 in germany an even better choice than before because it is nearly as equipped as an icon best choice now if the range is nor so important
2022-03-10,YouTube Comment,question do you know if there are any fiat 500 electric motor adapters available to purchase im looking to put an hpevs ac50 with a 120v 650amp controller need an adapter i have everything else
2022-02-10,YouTube Comment,no youll struggle to resell the 24kwh version spring for the 42kwh battery with the more powerful motor its worth the extra
2022-01-31,YouTube Comment,poor you no heated seats and nought to sixty in only nine seconds what do you think i dont think anyone cares do something else let someone who is good at car reviews do it we dont want your silly little likes and dislikes
2021-10-26,YouTube Comment,them pants are ridiculous huggy bear fom starsky and hutch car usless just a toy car copy 70s adult size cars aswell huggy
2021-09-24,YouTube Comment,i choose the bigger battery the passion i adore this little car i will call it my cicciolina 😘
2021-09-09,YouTube Comment,20k pounds is 277k usd nearly 28k and it doesnt come with cruise control or heated seats seriously fiat get your ish together i am sure the wiring harnesses are identical for models with and without cruise they cant possibly be saving more than a few bucks per car by not including either
2021-08-30,YouTube Comment,weve had the la prima for 6 daysits now parked up in our garage we cant use it its illegal to use on uk roads as it doesnt have the slow moving pedestrian warning sound its not even listed on the menu safety and security and our insurer refuses to provide cover other than fire and theft so if you have one of these and its missing the sound you not insured to drive on uk or eu roads you have been warned
2021-08-29,YouTube Comment,no wonder manufacturers are pushing all electric 50100 more expensive than their ice equivalents
2021-08-18,YouTube Comment,those options are pricey the already high price just makes it even more expensive
2021-08-14,YouTube Comment,i prefer cloth seats ngl better in summer and dont really need heated seats in winter never used heated seats and steering wheel also with my lifestyle id need the bigger battery
2021-08-13,YouTube Comment,10 plastic from the sea recycling that amount from ocean plastic would cost more than the touch screen and more make your research that is green wash from fiat
2021-08-11,YouTube Comment,i believe this is the right size for electric cars i cannot believe theres people that buys humongous 50k electric suvs with a 300km top range that defeats the need of a big car in the first place small cars are perfect in city commutes cos theres going to be a charging point somewhere were you can plug it in for the night and with what you save you can rent a car to go further if fancy strikes you prices need to lower though
2021-08-01,YouTube Comment,i went and had a test drive in the la prima spec of this car yesterday after watching this review was absolutely shocked at just how cheap and plasticky it felt inside drove okay looked good from the outside but jees just so cheap on the inside
2021-07-12,YouTube Comment,one of the best reviews so far
2021-06-30,YouTube Comment,heated seats are a must for electric cars
2021-06-30,YouTube Comment,ideal for a city subscription car rentals
2021-06-30,YouTube Comment,if this comes up on leaseloco with zero down payment at under 180 per month ill bite their hand off as a 2nd car
2021-06-30,YouTube Comment,id defo opt for that winter pack heated seats and steering wheel is a must once youve had it
2021-06-30,YouTube Comment,if this was 16k base spec id say yes its worth it still pricey at 20k for bare bones car
2021-06-25,YouTube Comment,good review will get a 500 for my wifes local runs it looks great is easy to drivepark but will go for a higher spec model the action is a bit sparse its range too low
2021-06-25,YouTube Comment,i believe the extra 4k is definitely worth it i just think that 20k for no screen at all is extremely stingy even the eup has a screen and the decreased range will take a massive toll say if you are travelling long distance you will have to be stopping every hour or so
2021-06-15,YouTube Comment,i just drove one today and was disappointed the infotainment system is terrible cluttered menu and counterintuitive and having buttons to select the gear is an idea you need to have a very peculiar mind to find useful the indicator arm was mechanical and often remains in the active position after you complete the turn the navigation was slow and fiddly unless youre a family of midgets or your passengers are pugs the backseat is only for show its hard to see where the car ends both ends the lane assist was worse than driving with an anxious motherinlaw in the backseat the worst thing was the lack of mechanical door opening to get out of the car you press a button so make sure you never run the battery to zero or you will need to break a window to escape the positives good acceleration and nice dashboard the size is of course convenient but thats common for all small cars two usb ports but the old usb2 standard instead of usbc which is the new standard and a proper space for your phone good size cup holders and the glove compartment was decent for the car size the seats were comfortably firm all in all i think this is a car that will appeal much more to women than to men they may find its quirks more charming than utilitarian men
2021-06-12,YouTube Comment,i love the 15 inch wheels that trend to keep installing larger and larger wheels in any car is just ridiculous not even sports cars need 19 20 21 inch wheels let alone your daybyday grocery getter
2021-06-11,YouTube Comment,my wife had a fiat 500 petrol and then a semi automatic because the position of the accelerator and clutch gave her terrible leg ache it also did the same thing to me i hated it it was too bouncy pulled to the kerb was gutless with no boot to speak of to top it all off it was bloody expensive and the electric version will outprice itself when other makes come on line
2021-06-11,YouTube Comment,did you turn off the fake engine sound i couldnt hear it
2021-06-09,YouTube Comment,finally a car that is heading in the right direction as a second car perfect and the lack of technology is for me a very good thing once the dealer incentives kick in a nearly new one of these will be well under 20k very cool
2021-06-09,YouTube Comment,well dont go shopping with little shits then u will also have the back seats for xtra shopping luv 😀
2021-06-09,YouTube Comment,i bought a fiat panda ten years ago for 5995 with a range of 300 miles and a refill time of 10 minutes or less progress
2021-06-17,YouTube Comment,it takes me 12 seconds to charge my electric car six seconds to plug it in at night before i go to bed and another six seconds to unplug it the morning when i get up i usually do this every 8 to 9 days oh i really miss standing in a puddle of spilt diesel having to hold a filthy fuel nozzle in place until the car is full ive not been near a petrol station for two years im welling up at the memory
2021-06-09,YouTube Comment,sorry not good value my wife only 3 years ago bought a new limited edition mazda mx5 rag top full infotainment systemheated seats auto lights and wipers hill start assist reversing sensors cruise control blah blah 21900 plus of course one of the best roadsters on the market if i want cheap id look at dacia aka renault the price difference between one of those and the fiat buys a huge mountain of fuel and it wont run out of juice after just 80 or 90 miles
2021-06-19,YouTube Comment,how strange you areput up a pic of your food prep area
2021-06-07,YouTube Comment,does it have a heat pump or not can you please include this information in all your reviews thanks
2021-06-06,YouTube Comment,if you want cute and dont mind owning fiat quality ok but if you want the same range maybe a bit more all year round buy a low mileage leaf 30kwh for half the price
2021-06-06,YouTube Comment,still too expensivecompetition from other manufacturers should influence the prices in the futurenot for me at that price
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,maybe this should be considered which will be far cheaper and more effective battery technology currently is still hopelessly inadequate unfortunately httpswwwmotorcyclenewscomnewsnewtechsyntheticpetrol
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,i wish i could afford it i can barely pay rent i want this car so very badly
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,im sorry but back to basics is the security equipment power steering air conditioning and central locking this is unnecessarily equiped with loads of stuff that just add price and could be solved including the screen with less apps its a more rational usage of resources and even a cost saving solution that is very easy to lower the final price this care is definitely not worthy
2021-06-09,YouTube Comment,sadly a lot of the kit it comes with is mandated by the eu these days as standard safety equipment so it has to have it no matter what granted that adds to the price and does explain that new new cars will be more expensive then a car designed even 12 years ago the uk agreed to accept the eu standards as part of brexit so it will be the same here too
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,cute but always get the highest range models not here in usa yet but interested in it theses reviews are short and mostly on smooth roads the new ev version is a few inches longer than the the previous one my old scion iq is still champ at parking 10 feet vs 12 feet perfect city car my little iq has a ice though so not limited by charging stations just gas its been all over ca including death valley now that would be a fun test for the new 500
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,ussless electric till they make one that goseover 500 miles no use as travle lots and not many charge points no use at all and cant have in flats no points anywere tocharge them so basicly no point there nive but not good forlots just a few that i have spoken to
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,such a great looking car more penfold than dangermouse 😁
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,personally dont think the reduction in cost is enough to justify the smaller battery and reduced range as well as the paired back spec drop the list price to sub 18k and fiat are on to a winner
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,finally somebody who prefers not to have leather seats
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,considering you can twist the arm of an mg dealer and get a zs ev excite for that price and have a tonne more spec space and decent bit more range
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,no the entry level costs 35000
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,you can probably find a pre reg e208 in a dealership for 20k that would definitely be a better buy
2021-06-17,YouTube Comment,but the mg zs ev may not tick everyones boxes
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,my 100 congestion charge discount ceases in october for my hybrid suv at 15 per day i either have to replace it with an eye watering 40k new ev suv if i still want to drive inside the new bigger zone where i live or buy a 2nd car such as this for half the price these figures make the 500 very attractive to londoners
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,wouldnt take a fiat if it was handed to me for free 😂😂😂😂
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,base model looks great and i am sure the range would be enough for a lot of people a lot of the time its still expensive compared to ice alternatives but new tech often is and this is definitely a good value route into ev ownership great review thanks
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,the decider is second car or not if it is a to be a second car then its got to be less expensive to match the crop of shorter range vehicles available nearly newsecond hand the longer range model puts it back in the same league as other one car options
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,for about the same price you can get a better range bigger storage similarly or better equipped mg seat no competition in my view but im not bothered about style and funky
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,the cheapest mg is more than 20 more expensive we do love the seat mii electric though
2021-06-07,YouTube Comment,electrifyingcom list prices are irrelevant its lease costs that matter you can get a mii leaf zoe mg zs or 5 for less than this version or a kona ioniq and id3 for no more than the 42kwh version
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,nikki is a great presenter love the fiat too
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,i own a petrol fiat 500 and i love it ill definitely replace it with a new electric one but i have to admit to not really liking how theyve redesigned the back that said i was really struck at home much better the whole car looks in white i really wasnt sold on the three glum colours of the rest of the range a white one with all of the bigger battery and all the bells and whistles with the addition of some cool vinyls would be my perfect new car
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,if you want a fiat 500 take the old version in hybrid format and save over 6k and get more kit price of electric cars dont make sense right now and the old version is still selling well
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,apart from the fact that if you did 12000 miles a year then the hybrid one would likely cost you at least 1200 in fuel more likely 1500 whereas with cheap rate home charging it could cost around 150 so over the course of 5 years it pays for itself especially when you add in lower servicing costs as well
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,topo gigio tv cartoon character from the 1960s
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,i think theyve missed a trick here there are plenty of grumpy old gits like myself who would like the strippedout interior but still have a big battery all the new satnav stereo stuff will go out of date or even obsolete very quickly and i would rather be able to just install third party hardware that can be easily changed
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,unfortunately youre in the minority there dacia did this with the previous generation sandero but havent gone down the same route with the new one so it obviously didnt do too well
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,johnknight9150 exactly its a dacia the whole point of dacia was that theyre no frills cars but clearly a lack of stereo is taking things too far
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,q3b26 aye but if youre simply after a no frills car thats different plenty of us want a gorgeous car which is not a dacia but without the annoying electronics and gadgetry that plagues modern motoring i still drive a 1999 saab because its a nice balance of looks and comfort and fitted with a newer stereo provides enough modern convenience without getting in the way with annoying beeps and bongs and warning messages its sublime a lot of gadgetry in cars never gets used and a lot of customers would be happy not to pay for annoying distractions
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,the baterry is way to small a two digit range pretty much wouldnt work for me at all
2021-06-19,YouTube Comment,then buy one with a bigger batterynote the spelling of battery
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,interesting review that poses some important questions car looks fine and ideal for city living and commutes as ns clearly pointed out which car and options you go for depends upon your own needs
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,so this base 500e has a 24kwh battery
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,i love the look but the small range means its going to have stiff competition from the chinese once their tiny evs arrive costing from a few thousand pounds with a similar range i wonder what the pcl is on these
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,much like the mazda mx30 this seems like a very good if quite expensive second car
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,not very keen on this car
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,its a seriously sad state of affairs when 205k is considered a cheapno frills car these days the fact most people lease cars these days seems to give manufacturers license to inflate prices to eye watering levels
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,i notice it had an engine start button what engine it has a motor
2021-08-30,YouTube Comment,7755ian1 it does but only when setting off for the first time after turning on the car then the regular pedestrian alert hum is played which is very similar to most other evs out there
2021-11-23,YouTube Comment,did you get wallcharger i will get 7 kw thought its better
2022-05-21,YouTube Comment,did you the winter pack thinking of ordering one but i am not entirely convinced about the leather seats in winter without any heated seats
2022-05-21,YouTube Comment,thepeadar79 no we dont have heated seats they can get a bit chilly in the winter and theyre not actual leather but vinyl although very nice
2022-05-21,YouTube Comment,cochitravels thank you so much for your kind reply if i may ask is there anything that in hindsight you may have changed to your order or you are happy enough with the standard la prima unfortunately here at the moment theres only the icon trim on showroom so we may have to pay the deposit now without actually seeing the car
2022-05-21,YouTube Comment,thepeadar79 no worries if anything la prima requires a bit more upkeep because of the white interior and white steering wheel getting dirty after some use definitely must have accessories are the dimming rear view mirror panoramic sunroof and radar cruise control with lane keep assist
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,maybe i am just not trendy buy there is no way i would buy this over the mg zs not that i will ever have that conundrum as there is no way i will ever be able to afford an ev
2021-06-09,YouTube Comment,second hand evs are very reasonable now and given the lack of enginetransmissiondrivetrain actually as reliable as a new one it is going to be a thing we have to get used to a 23 year old ev is nearly the same as brand new apart from the price
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,absolutely horrendous its lost the charm old the old school style that fiat brought us with the new 500 and at this price they are dreaming add on all the options that come as standard on other brands like nissan etc then the fiat 500 really has lost its plot
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,20000 for a entry level city car 😱 yes youll get your money back in running costs eventually but how long is that going to take when you can choose from many used equivalent city cars like vw ups starting from 5000 even all electric ones from 10000
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,give it time and they will decrease in cost its exactly like iphones when they launched in 2007 they started off expensive and then moved to being slightly affordable
2021-06-07,YouTube Comment,in italy with governament reduction the action costs a total of 15k euros and the big battery version is around 20k euros
2021-06-09,YouTube Comment,scruffyita the uk government grant on electric cars is down to just 2500 used to be around 5000 and that only applies to electric cars under 35000 ive noticed other countries offering better incentives
2021-06-17,YouTube Comment,it could be sooner than you might think if charges to enter city centres like the one introduced in birmingham on the 1st june become more prevalent birmingham charges 8 per day 7 days per week for cars and vans not meeting euro 6 emissions york coventry leeds and bath are allegedly looking to do the same the day of the ev draws ever nearer
2021-06-25,YouTube Comment,danielrichards8472 yes very true i am in awe of the romanian govt being willing to offer their citizens a new electric car for only 7500 😮
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,any ev with a range less than 150 miles real world is just full stop especially as used car buy after a few years just look at autotrader adds for used zoe or leaf and you will see range is a joke 5060 miles
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,why how many cars of this size only do 30 odd miles a day hell i dont think ive done over 150 miles in a day in a year
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,benholroyd5221 well many or most people do less than a 30 miles a day worldwide however once a week or a month you decide to go to the nearest town or park and you are done not possible 100 miles ranges are joke these better be left for an electric scooter plus small city cars are used often for delivery food medicines car parts parcels well these evs wont make it plus the inconvenience of charging every day
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,toninocars if youre rural enough to have to travel 50 miles to the nearest park youre probably rural enough to not need to travel to the park and what percentage of the global population are more than 50 miles from a town 1 01 it doesnt need to work for 100 of the population 100 of the time people have second cars some people dont travel 50 miles to a park
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,benholroyd5221 well the time will show what i mean all these zoe and leafs are wasted if they were ice cars would have been sold again and in use the electric cars with short ranges will create a future problem shortage of used cars and will drive ice used cars sky high prices until there is no more petrol available in the garages
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,toninocars id disagree ev sales are still a small percentage of overall sales and were already moving out of the realm of sub 100 mile evs as such the numbers of low range evs hanging around are going to be low and demand is going to be buoyed by second hand buyers wanting any ev at the very least i think you overestimate most peoples desire for ic over new you can get 15 year old cars for relative peanuts people still want the latest and greatest i dont think the person who buys a new car every 3 years is going to stop because ev
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,a refreshingly honest review thank you and yes having a pairedback car can often be fun more then for the driver to do so more interaction with the process of driving fab car
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,i have always liked the 500 i was lucky enough to own an early proper 500 1968 model with the 499cc 2 cylinder petrol engine it still has an appealing look even now though i dont think much of the headlight design the lower range battery would be no good for me as i do a 74 mile round trip daily commute which is mostly motorway miles in this area the infrastructure just isnt good enough having done some research at present its still cheaper to run my 2011 smart diesel as i am unable to have a home chargepoint i would have to have another vehicle to complete my working weeks journeys as i would only be able to charge up on my days off due to the only chargepoints being in a car park which closes at night i work long unsociable hours and wouldnt be able to get to the car park during opening hours very often at present i am going to have to stick with my little smart diesel until battery range on vehicles improves and prices become more affordable admittedly battery ranges are improving in so many reviews its assumed that drivers want range for doing longer journeys in many cases this is true but its also needed for those of us who are unable to have a home chargepoint and where the infrastructure is also very poor just as a side point i have written to my local councils and mp on many occasions but have never received a response thank you for your reviews i enjoy watching this channel and have subscribed although not many of the cars appeal to me personally i am intrigued by the advances in battery technology having also briefly owned a reva g wiz many years ago
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,the front headlight design looks similar to that phase the vw beetle owners went through by sticking eyelashes on its headlights each one to their own i guess
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,this is the one that makes more sense how many people need to top up after 70 miles around town which is where 95 of them will live looks better without silly big wheels as well
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,basically acceptable ev credibility from 20122017
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,fiat is the best
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,fine as a second car but the larger battery version could be an only car for someone without a family i think the current crop of smaller evs are going to be interesting used buys in a few years when they wont be eye wateringly expensive the eight year battery warranties take away a lot of the risk of a three year old car too
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,the battery is large
2022-03-10,YouTube Comment,when i purchased a used 500e the price was fine but now that gas prices are in the 6 range the prices of high mileage 500es have skyrocketed so converting a gas version with a manual transmission is the way to go at this point in time
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,fiat 500e however
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,lets hope stellantis can live up to the legacy of this car so far theyve shown to produce cheap quality and act arrogantly towards customers and critical journalists
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,i realize the fiat is in very hot water here right now in the states as far as the possibility of it being axed but i do hope they bring this 500 to the states it would be good competition for the mini se
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,axed what ever for
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,menifo4334 last i heard i thought they were going to pull fiat out of the us though i must stress i havent had the opportunity to hear anything super recent so if they changed their mind and decided to keep fiat in the states then im all the happier
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,maybe you could ask frank stephenson what he thinks of how his design has been updated this is the perfect city car except one major flaw no male could possibly be seen dead in this shame cos i like it
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,i drive a smart electric and have preserved my masculinity just get the 500e in black and green with dark interior
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,smartelectriccar hahahahahhahaahahaha deep breath hahahahahaahahahahahahaha
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,that kind of opinion shows toxic masculinity i would buy its available in my country i wouldnt even mind a pink one if its add to the rare factor
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,look at fiats sales figures and then look at a road disregarding the abarth models no males buy 500s period so dont lie that youd buy one let alone in pink cos you wouldnt
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,ill be picking up a 500e in a few weeks time ill let you know if my masculinity shrivels up and dies
2022-04-11,YouTube Comment,are there any fully electric not hybrid small vans out there
2022-03-23,YouTube Comment,i worried about the footwell space but if you just slightly pull your left leg back you find the resting place perfectly lines your knee and calf up with a little concave curve in the dash so it just kind of hugs your kneeits very comforting weve just paid our deposit for one and cant wait to go fully electric
2023-06-23,YouTube Comment,paulhayes2189 i love it absolutely love it with aircon infotainment and lights i think the range is more like 150 miles but i can go a whole week to and from work on one charge charging at motorway services can be painfully slow but if youre passing a gridserve electric highway like the one a braintree essex its soooo fast i went from 49 to 85 in 15 minutes the footwell size is no issue at all even if im wearing big winter boots theres plenty of room climate control is a blessing in winter and very efficient at defrosting you can pack a huge amount in it with or without dropping the back seats the turning circle it small and being a small car you can park in some pretty small spaces in short i have no regrets getting my 500e none at all 😊
2022-01-01,YouTube Comment,looks great really hope they fix the foot placement thought particularly for frequent long commuters i imagine doing 2 x 15hour trips every work day that would get annoying quickly aside from that it sounds awesome keep the mini evs videos coming really enjoy them mini car not mini video length although that works too xd
2022-02-13,YouTube Comment,you learn to comfortably place your leg around it then its really no biggie even after a 6090 minutes behind the wheel 1 pedal driving helps give you some more room
2021-12-16,YouTube Comment,decent fiat that
2021-12-08,YouTube Comment,i am also a total petrolhead and had never previously driven a bev until i had an extended test drive of a 500e last week one pedal range mode which made a huge impression for the same reasons as you i immediately placed an order and it should arrive later this month i hope the next owner of my tradein a twingo gt enjoys it as much as i did but for me ice vehicles are now as redundant as steam powered cars at the beginning of last century
2021-10-26,YouTube Comment,plonkerheads usless expensive toy car review done
2021-10-10,YouTube Comment,why use inches this is a european car they still use metric because its logical and sensible

2021-09-17,YouTube Comment,what model is this looking at getting one i seen its a one medal drive is that right x
2021-08-08,YouTube Comment,a nice car but the range is off putting real world driving around 90 miles isnt it like buying a similar sized car with a fuel tank of less then 2 gallons my town car a 900cc twin air fiat 500 will do around 450 miles or only 20 miles short of london to scotland thats with the heater on im all in favour for an ev but range and price is paramount at over 20k i think there are cheaper cars out there with a longer range like the the seat mii with a 37 kwh battery just like the first mobile phones vhs video players and 50 inch tvs not many people could afford them in time another 10 years im sure this same car will be priced around 14k in todays money
2021-06-19,YouTube Comment,i want the newww 500e but i live in for saken america 😩😩😩😩 i hate it here😣😣
2021-06-12,YouTube Comment,i want to buy electric i believe in the ethics etc but why oh why so expensive who has this kind of money i dont best i can afford for a second hand car is 4k
2021-06-11,YouTube Comment,seat mii electric 16k if you shop around not as stylish as this but still a brilliant city car
2021-06-11,YouTube Comment,any tiny city car at 20k is 100 not a bargain im sorry
2021-06-08,YouTube Comment,nice car but 32k
2021-06-07,YouTube Comment,you spent remarkably little time stuck in a queue given that you were driving round the middle of cambridge it was fun spotting the locations from glimpses out of the window this was also pretty much the definition of an unnecessary car journey which is exactly the sort of thing we want less of round here marginally better in an ev than an ice car i suppose
2021-06-07,YouTube Comment,great vid and also has wireless apple carplay but no room for any passengers in the back unless they have left their legs at home i think you may be the first review to mention the left foot problem
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,that awkwardness with the left foot position would be a dealbreaker for mei know i wouldnt be able to stop being annoyed by it
2021-06-05,YouTube Comment,doesnt occur in the lhd version surprised they didnt think more about that in design conversion i drive a gen 1 fiat 500e in california have had no problem with left foot placement
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,my 2014 fiat 500e is now 7 years old over 70000 miles best car ive ever owned i dont see any battery degradation so far the car has paid for itself in fuel cost savings maintenance costs are still zero except for tires and head light bulbs
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,had a 500e in the family for 7 months now and we are in love
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,my daughter drove the kona for the first time she had some problems with smooth braking then i found out she uses the left foot for braking so should you
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,disliked for animal skin seats
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,not sure how you think this beats the mini for value for money if you spec them the same they cost the same plus the fiat has a significant power disadvantage
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,hey kol same setup here as well mercedes twin turbo v8 and 500e laprima in dark blue cabrioperfect combo remember this phrase said to me by a porsche salesman when talking about the difference between petrol and electric driving one petrol or electric really makes you appreciate the other
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,ordered mine the 15th of march got a phone call a week later from the dealer that specs had all changed and needed to reorder so lots of heat scratching trying to get exactly what i wanted against what was allowed as fiat ordering had not updated web site to match new ordering site basically it appears fiat were coping with over demand by cutting range a bit dealer and i finally reached a good compromise and fiat swallowed the small price increase as a bit if good faith got a call today that car will be ready for collection june 4th so roughly 10 weeks delivery time on an in demand car got the rag top so looking forward to a super summer cant wait😁
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,yeah weve had a similar experience with their dealerships but its great news that youre getting it in time for this awesome weather well done
2021-05-31,YouTube Comment,for lots of people 20000 for a limited range run around is off putting specially when you look at the very limited running gear they have to produce for an e car compared to combustion engined vehicles they just are not good value
2021-05-30,YouTube Comment,fiat 500 httpsyoutubezoc1qwllfki
2021-05-30,YouTube Comment,brilliant a fab new ev choice aggressively priced yet fully kitted and a properly usable range very impressed
2021-05-30,YouTube Comment,the 500 doesnt have twice the range of the honda e nevertheless the honda e has eightfold the driving fun and ride quality quadruple the wow factor and originality twice the confort and practicality and presumably a zillion times more reliability the car and the battery
2021-05-30,YouTube Comment,just for completeness the leftfootissue is only a problem on the righthand drive model but then again you can always drive it racing style with your left foot on the brake
2021-05-30,YouTube Comment,wouldnt ever buy a fiat utter garbage no matter how you dress it up european cars will be the last on my list of cars to buy tesla or japanese cars are def better choices
2021-05-30,YouTube Comment,this and the renault zoe are the best small electric cars

2021-05-29,YouTube Comment,hei if you talk about the new 500 you cant not mention the fca my dream garage option you get only if buy a 500 httpswwwfiatcomelectriccarmydreamgarageapp
2021-05-29,YouTube Comment,fiat 500e is small and feels small too plastic interior and has a much more cheaper feel than honda e overall i prefer honda e even if it has less range i bought honda e instead after driving fiat 500e here in sweden honda e gives you much better build quality more interesting tech more comfort cooler retrofuturistic design interior that gives you a feel of a nice looking living room lots of huge screens hdmiin and much more to enjoy range is good enough for its purpose too honda e makes other people smile when you drives around in town its fun and makes everyone happy really great car compared to fiat 500e
2021-05-29,YouTube Comment,youve definitely made some valid points but for me i buy a car to travel in and therefore range takes priority over design and hdmi sockets the 500 is super comfy has enough range to not have range anxiety and is nimble to use in the city i also love the new stance design of the 500
2021-05-30,YouTube Comment,agree i rented one of these and found it to be the most uncomfortable vehicle i have ever been in add to that the cheap feel of the interior and i would run away from this car as fast as possible toyota and honda quality is far ahead
2021-05-29,YouTube Comment,why are you promoting animal skin on the seats
2021-06-01,YouTube Comment,lassievision 😂😂 brilliant 😂😂
2021-05-29,YouTube Comment,not to be like that i think the 500e looks like an awesome city car but you kind of forgot the zoe its best in class for range affordability
2021-05-29,YouTube Comment,great video chaps what a lovely little car im a big fan of it i just hope fiat make an electric panda
2021-05-29,YouTube Comment,we have nicer weather in australia but no affordable evs bring em in
2021-05-30,YouTube Comment,we have a similar ev problem in the us no fiat 500e no renault zoe no vw id3 most of the bestselling evs in europe are not for sale in the us
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,to be fair i dont find 20k affordable the new dacia spring will be more affordable than this and offers more space inside and in the boot you can barely get in the back seats of a 500
2021-08-08,YouTube Comment,dirkdiggler6230 looks and not reliability if im spending that kind of money id be more interested in reliability and as a sidenote i currently drive a fiat i have previously owned about 5 other fiats throughout my life so ive nothing against fiat my point was simply that evs in general are still way too expensive in europe many of us would love to go green but unfortunately cant afford to
2021-05-29,YouTube Comment,fiat is one of the least reliable auto makers but happy to see they are transitioning to electric
2021-05-29,YouTube Comment,pisses me off that they wont be bringing this to the us damn shame hey fiat bring it over
2021-05-29,YouTube Comment,great big honking v8 fiat 500e maybe something in the middle of that field just a thought

2021-06-01,YouTube Comment,i had a 13 fiat 500 abarth most fun ive ever had in a car with my clothes onextremely reliable car until i lost a coil on the highway and continued to drive i destroyed the lower end of the engine fing idiot i took it to the shop the 1st time it briefly dropped its rpms on the highway and they only found vacuum leaks to fix i completely blame myself as i knew the coils were notoriously weak temp gauge never moved had a set of alfa 4c coils on order when i scrambled her i am still sick about walking away from that car today i got her from a good friend for 10 k w 20 k on the odometer she died at 90 k 3 years after purchase cant imagine how great the electric version is drove this car from phoenix az to las vegas at night never been in a car that could launch up a hill so fast ive heard it referred to as a canyon runner yes it is this 14 l turbo 172 hp motor is the same as the jeep compass and the dodge dart i would buy another one tomorrow if offered to me mine was white with the top half painted black aftermarket very sharp car

2021-05-30,YouTube Comment,a californian compliance electric 500 perhaps
2021-05-28,YouTube Comment,this was a great wee first drive video loved the banter and fun fiat doing wat they do best great little city cars this is going to be a pretty big deal i think for alot of younger people looking to get in to the ev world the variety in specs range and price etc will be massive selling points for so many looks like its managed to maintain its 500ness and yet move with the times huge advances in the interior from the older models well done fiat
2021-05-28,YouTube Comment,whatever bites your biscuit thats not an expression it is now
2021-06-01,YouTube Comment,i thought he said buttersthe cc on the video agreed w you steven
2021-05-28,YouTube Comment,lovely car good range reasonable charging speed however the boot is on the tiny side to be expected in such a small car but if the car is to be the only driver it would need to fit a bit of luggage for short journeys
2021-06-23,YouTube Comment,i hardly use the boot i toss everything in the backseat of my abarth 500595
2021-05-28,YouTube Comment,the achilles heel of the previous 500e was the total lack of a dc fast charger _and_ a small range a gutpunch combination this one is everything that one should have been but unfortunately it will not be available where im at usa
2021-05-29,YouTube Comment,cant you order one through a chrysler or dodge dealer
2021-05-29,YouTube Comment,nor australia unfortunately though its a perfect city car and most people only do 5080km a day commutes
2021-05-29,YouTube Comment,antonthompson7838 not to my knowledge best i could do is possibly buy one from a canadian dealer if they sell it there or from a dealer in europe and have it shipped both of which would massively add to the cost
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,justwasted3hourshere i thought you couldnt import a foreign car to america until it was 25 years old

2021-05-28,YouTube Comment,not bad on the range for the but ill wait for the xpeng p7 no more egolf for me why make a car like that with 100 mile range at least fiat this time stepped it up with some range
2021-05-29,YouTube Comment,the egolf is a compliance car not a bad one but it still is

2021-05-28,YouTube Comment,anonimushbosh dont need a manly car at all ive drove nothing but fairy normal hatchbacks all my life just the standard 500s are the quintessential girly girl car i have nothing against small cars ether i would love a honda e if i had the monies
2021-05-28,YouTube Comment,well done clever video as long as you just need a commuter theyre fine but if you do distance forget about it then you need two cars
2021-05-28,YouTube Comment,you could if you really wanted to fiat also addressed another shortcoming previously slow to charge the time for the 2020 500e is greatly reduced using an 85kilowatt charger the battery can reach 80 percent in a mere 35 minutes
2021-05-29,YouTube Comment,george090974 exactly this range argument is becoming moot very rapidly

2021-05-28,YouTube Comment,cant wait to order one genuinely fun little car with a whopping 199 miles of range 😍
2021-06-01,YouTube Comment,199 is the wltp range which is good for comparing vehicles but isnt what youll get in real life count on 120 to 160 miles in mixed use driving depending on outside temperature and speed
2023-06-22,YouTube Comment,so driving normally under 55 milescqm hour you are really looking at approx 150 miles no more

2024-03-21,YouTube Comment,i bought one of the first ones a 2015 model i am still driving it 60k on the odometer i live in a city its range went from 95 down to about 6070now i drive an hour up to the wine country charge then drive back its fine i have another vehicle for road trips and i drive my old fiat 90 of the time i would definitely buy another one its the funnest fastest sportiest car ive ever driven i do know that other buyers have had troubles with their car i have never had any trouble i have replaced only the tires it goes through tires but i live on the famous super steep sf hills but after 60k miles my brakes still work fine i am just saying i love this car i would hope to buy a larger suv type electric in another couple years the key to preserving your car is simple always keep the battery between 2080 dont charge to full never run down to 0 of course i charge it to full before a long trip up to the country and a handful of times ive forced it to 0 or even a couple miles past zero emergency happen in 9 years of driving really never do that just saying if you need a computer car that you can park literally anywhere because it is so small this is a real winner i like have all that extra room in my garage
2024-03-18,YouTube Comment,isnt the range 199 miles i have one and love if
2024-03-14,YouTube Comment,the red fiat looks like a broken lipstick tipso cute i usually dont like red but this red is gorgeous i hope it comes as a gas car i am not into electric cars at all our electric grid is not enough for everyone to have ev cars
2024-03-13,YouTube Comment,ive always loved the little 500 😊 ice or ev
2024-03-06,YouTube Comment,i cant believe this turd is allowed in the us just goes to show you what joe biden thinks of his subjects marie antoinette said let them eat cake biden says let them buy crap and die on the highway
2024-03-04,YouTube Comment,price is the biggest issue although in the uk a 10 discount is freely available
2024-03-03,YouTube Comment,hope chinese evs shows up one day you can get mid size suv starting 10000 brand new
2024-02-24,YouTube Comment,this car should start from 25k
2024-02-16,YouTube Comment,just bring the abarth back to the us this cars specs dont work for the american market people typically have 1 car that needs to do short city runs and longer highway drives this 35k ev can only reliably do shorter drives it is completely ineffective in colder markets
2024-01-22,YouTube Comment,ive been looking forward to this for years but i was expecting juuust a little bit more power 8 seconds to 100 kmh is so slow i consider it dangerous i was sure this thing would have done 6 seconds sad pass
2024-01-12,YouTube Comment,still kind of pricey and poor acceleration times for an ev bring us an updated abarth e to the usa for around 28k then i would be tempted
2024-01-06,YouTube Comment,numerous true arguments and for me in austria the new fiat 500e has too little ground clearance it is too heavy looks too fat and is far too expensive at half the price the leapmotor t03 baojun yep or chery eq1 are more suitable for me and i will test them
2023-12-31,YouTube Comment,its not going to sell 34k is too much for an ev especially when you have ice vehicle that is cheaper people looking at this vehicle will end up buying an accord or civic
2023-12-31,YouTube Comment,yeah but 35k still going for a tesla this is a 12k car
2023-12-31,YouTube Comment,red thats a republican color no republicans will be buying this overpriced appliance you should have made it blue and for 16000
2024-01-15,YouTube Comment,red and blue are both nice colors on the 500 please drop the political slant if auto manufacturers make a good mileage and quality vehicle the company can sell at an affordable price for consumers the dealers dont try and over price it people will but it let the numbers of sales make the money for everyone
2023-12-29,YouTube Comment,this will fail eventually looks great tho shame about their business model
2023-12-28,YouTube Comment,we need more little cars like this around la
2024-03-14,YouTube Comment,we need more little cars periodi drive mostly by myself not lugging anything
2023-12-23,YouTube Comment,whyyyyy wont they make new abarths or bring the electric abarth to the us
2023-12-26,YouTube Comment,its so cute i just want a small ev
2024-02-07,YouTube Comment,because tesla is efficient i wish tesla would make a car in this similar size
2024-02-23,YouTube Comment,then buy one ill take the fiat
2024-03-29,YouTube Comment,no for 35k u get a fiat thats the point of buying a 500 😂
2024-04-08,YouTube Comment,the tesla insurance is so high because of total frame destruction upon damage the fiat is much more repairable and hence cheaper insurance lets look at the total experience of ownership
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,updan not to mention the repair cost of owning a fiat also the fiat has no battery warranty
2023-12-20,YouTube Comment,first thing id do is paint the grill gloss black so it brought out its iconic smile 😊
2023-12-14,YouTube Comment,first gen fiat 500 was great but less dealers supporting fiat theyll test for battery condition for 600 to try to get replaced under warranty if they can say it doesnt qualify youre out 600
2023-12-20,YouTube Comment,i dont think its legal to charge you for warranty costs its up to the customer to realize youll lose 10miish from a 10yo ev
2023-12-10,YouTube Comment,the target market for the size is people who dont have room to park anything bigger but then the target market for the battery is people who can reliably plug in every day or two that sounds like a very small ven diagram of people in north america
2023-12-15,YouTube Comment,or people who dont feel the need to buy the biggest vehicle that fits in their garage
2023-12-09,YouTube Comment,we get this expensive overpriced car but we wont get the new ev renault twingo thats like 20k and arguably cooler
2023-12-09,YouTube Comment,nice car happy to see another fiat model in america still have my 2012 500 abarthand its never for salewill get the electric abarth when it arrives
2023-12-09,YouTube Comment,eventually when the repair cost is more than a low mileage used one 😅
2023-12-11,YouTube Comment,fortheloveofnoise9298i have a 2013 fiat 500 abarth as well an with almost 200000miles its not going anywhere as well its been across the us and i have had it since it was brand new maintaining it has never broke the bank and there hasnt been any mechanical issuesfailures
2024-01-17,YouTube Comment,mateorosas1272 im happy you asked if you have a 500 tubro500t abarth or a 500 after 2019 with the tubro as the only engine you must change the spark plugs at 30k intervals if not it will make the ignition coils fail eventually and cause a miss fire have the engine coolant and brake fluid flush i also recommend having your serpentine belt checked and it might need to be replaced just recently i have found out the aosair oil separator should be cleaned and gasket replaced along with the pcv valve at 40k one might not have any problems if pushed but if not taken care of can make one think they have a bad engine with light white smoke at a stop or idle it literally a 35 fixmaintenance in parts to make sure you 500 keeps running great along with your oil changes battery replacements and engine air filter changes this should help get you to 200k i happy to answer any other questions
2023-12-05,YouTube Comment,on board charger 115kw
2023-12-05,YouTube Comment,fiat says 11 so its probably 115 haha
2023-12-05,YouTube Comment,if fiat doesnt offer this in a cheaper option lets say equivalent or cheaper than the soon to be discontinued chevrolet bolt then theyre really doing themselves a disservice this thing could potentially sell amazingly well if it was cheaper since they are pricing it higher it could end up being discontinued rather fast just like the mazda mx30
2023-12-23,YouTube Comment,to be fair they dont seem to care this time the fiat ceo basically said they just wanna sell special versions
2024-01-07,YouTube Comment,its being imported from italy currently so they would probably have to manufacture 500es in north america to get the price that low
2024-02-11,YouTube Comment,the bolt is coming back in 2025 with even better range and faster charging im looking for a subcompact ev but 35k is insane
2023-12-05,YouTube Comment,i would love to have 2 motor all wheel drive
2023-12-05,YouTube Comment,sounds fun but then were adding back in so much weight because youd probably need a larger battery pack too
2023-12-20,YouTube Comment,its sad they didnt do it to the abarth version but theres also zero room under the car back there it has to use a torsion beam because of it but im sure people would be ok with losing the back trunk and seats
2023-09-16,YouTube Comment,fiat mini ev four seater with power windows ac will dominate in market
2023-06-29,YouTube Comment,unfortunately here in the us fiat doesnt have a good reputation
2023-04-08,YouTube Comment,yes it is the cheapest electric car and at the same time the poorest elcar in every aspect😉
2023-01-30,YouTube Comment,hmm a bit more expensive than i thought for the larger battery version certainly heading for the e corsae 208 price bracket
2023-01-18,YouTube Comment,anything less than a le prima and you have to pay for extra even for a fully adjustable drivers seat not heated its clear that fiat has pushed comfort standards asideeven tho they are charging 325k i really didnt like the la prima interior so i went for the icon 87kw with some extra packs my old fiat 500ss came with a fully adjustable seats and floor mats my abarth also had them as standard oh you also have to pay extra for floor mats instead fiat have wasted money just overloaded the car with tech most of which ive already turned off and find annoying as hell coming from my old abarth 595 competitione to a fiat 500e icon has definitely been eye opening and not in the best way the range is actually more like 145miles at least thats what ive found over the month ive had it driving mostly in range mode dont know how the hell she got 199 miles 😂not a chance
2023-04-27,YouTube Comment,ive just ordered a 500e red edition
2022-12-15,YouTube Comment,i have owned the q4 for coming up to 12 months now i agree with everything that has been said but audi do need to desperately update the software on the early cars there are a few glitches and a screen that comes on every time you start the car which you have to physically press ok to clear it regarding driving modes and range i have found it to be slightly better driving it in d mode than b mode especially now its getting colder for some reason audi do say its more efficient in d mode than b
2022-12-15,YouTube Comment,i have a 2014 fiat 500e now and i love it i definitely hope they ship the fiat la prima to the usa that car is my jam
2024-05-24,YouTube Comment,flash forward 1 year and the 500e is now being sold in the usa
2022-12-12,YouTube Comment,apparently the 500e is coming to north america im on the fence if this will sell or not sales of the 500 when it came back to north america in 2011 peaked during the first couple of years then slowly fizzled out until it made no sense for fiat to continue supporting the brand in north america customers simply went nuts with suvs and pickup trucks to the point that other car manufacturers dropped their cheap car offerings altogether with ford only keeping the mustang as their only car type vehicle
2022-12-31,YouTube Comment,do you know when the new 500e is scheduled to come to north america
2022-12-12,YouTube Comment,i think its very interesting that fiat is pushing so hard for reviews of these cars over a year after they came to the uk poor rhd sales perhaps could you please do a quick video showing where to safely put your left foot when driving thatd be great thanks
2022-12-12,YouTube Comment,while i have no sales numbers for the entire continent the fiat 500e has been in the top 5 of german new electric vehicle registration statistics for at least the last few months
2022-12-12,YouTube Comment,the range and price isnt good enough a lot of people are going to be forced off the road if prices dont come down and range doesnt increase
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,great small car you havent got the dacia spring there its more cheap less attractive though
2022-12-12,YouTube Comment,unfortunately the spring isnt on sale in the uk where we are based
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,i have a 52 year old 1970 500l quite a short range for very different reasons ill stick with that one
2022-12-12,YouTube Comment,i too want an affordable car the problem is that affordable cars dont provide the profit that todays automakers need to survive toyota motors can no longer survive on the profits delivered by a tercel or echo chrysler couldnt survive on the profits from dodge omnis todays stellantis surely can not do so either there wont be a cheap fiat 500e providing pete with an affordable car is not a concern to the automakers their job is to make a profit and give that money to the shareholders the automakers dont care if pete or anyone else has to take the bus
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,whatever miles it says always reduce 100 miles out of it that will be the realistic range in any condition and also deduct futhuer 5 miles every year as your batteries are dying as well now you decide what car you want with that price
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,take 100 miles off it you say thats funny because my bmw i3 has a wltp range of 137 miles yet i regularly got 140150 miles in summer and im currently getting about 120 miles in winter strange that oh and its 5 years old thats strange too isnt it
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,if youre shopping in the preowned market want the 42kwh drivetrain and are not overbothered about tech the discontinued passion version was a good compromise at several thousand cheaper than the more upmarket versions
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,ive had the la primanot by bocelli for a year and covered 11000 miles car has been perfect and all the self driving tech is amazing i can get about 160180 miles in summer and 140160 in winter over fast moorland roads and the lower echelons of the two are when hooning it 😂 its a cracking fun car to drive 062 8 seconds great chassis balance and its a 100kw motor not 87 as advertised thats only for low power mode 🙂 couldnt recommend it more to people and because its a fiat 500 no one expects it to take off the way it does theres few who will beat you at the lights and it even holds its on in the twisty stuff great machine and well worth your time and consideration
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,the 42kw version is the only ev in the world with a cabrio that has a 300km range pity that the price went up from 30k in 2020 to 37k in 2022 what is great is that it is a 2 door ev and that makes it more environmentally friendly less material less weight
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,could really do with the winter range as well as the manufacturers aspirational range
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,too be honest a 24kw version will probably suit me fine am finding my peugeot e208 range quite generous not that am complaining 😁
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,the higher spec 500 seems to make no sense to me i get that they are fashion statements but you can get a real usable car for that money mg4 springs to mind but there are others in the pipeline
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,the mg4 has no cabrio version and the mg4 is about 400kg more heavy than the fiat 500e cabrio 99 of the time there is nobody sitting in the 2 empty seats in the back and there is no use for the 2 rear doors so what is a real usable car we use only 2 seats 100 of the time and 70 of the time we enjoy the openend cabrio roof
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,chrispenn715 smaller cars appeal to a very large part of the globale market not everyone weighs 150kg and needs a 10 square meter car 😁 countries like china and india mostly use small cars specially in crowded cities and even most europeans ride around in small leightweight ice cars except maybe the germans but they to are starting to grow bigger and bigger 😉
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,yall often forget most of the world drives on the right so that 3rd door option is pretty slick
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,23k is enough for a small car just needs the bigger battery to make it a player once the small chinese evs hit in 2023
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,my wife loves the fun look of the fiat 500 but i seriously doubt she would be happy driving one me id get a kick out of running errands around town in the cabrio model im surprised by the 24kw models range as my leaf had the same size battery and could barely hit 100 miles in ideal conditions
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,100 miles is a fantasy its rated for 30 kwh100 miles here in america our ratings are closer to reality than the wltp ratings yall use accordingly the 24 kwh battery version would only have a range of 80 miles
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,i love the wireless android auto in my iconworks flawless each time no issues makes me laugh how alot of ev cars are still wired only android auto yet these same cars have a wireless charging padwhere is the sense in that even the new mg4 has dated wired android auto when my lease is up in 17 month i wont be getting another car that is wired only makes a world of difference which if you have not used it before you will not understand
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,charming as you are you lost me when you stated something like this is the cheapest car in the uk except for other 3 that are cheaper and also this is not available to buy now whats the point of it all madam nil points
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,for everyone who does not knowalways ignore the offical rangewhen you get the car you litterally see the 199 range show up1 time then after that in summer you can sometimes charge to 170 miles or about 160 miles winter it is more like 140 to 150 mile range
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,ev database states youll get around 145 real range im currently at the same mark with my 40kw gen 2 leaf im sure the leaf is also more efficient than the fiat
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,caolkyle actually i was getting a full 170 when it was warmer weather in the weather we have right now im getting about 145155i got 155 the other day i keep a check on it it is 160 miles a week to work and back and when it was warmer i did not have to charge during the week right now i am charging once but only about 50 mile top up
2022-12-12,YouTube Comment,marklola12 is that in a leaf or fiat
2022-12-15,YouTube Comment,rule of thumb with evs is always 90 real world summer 70 real world winter take off a further 10 for motorways add on 10 for town driving only
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,no point going for the 24kw version and go for the 42kw like i did tbh the icon model has everything you really need i got mine for 250 a month which includes maintience and it cost a extra 10 a month in that price for the black model as the free white colour was out of stock
2022-12-12,YouTube Comment,unless of course you dont do more than 75 miles a day
2023-01-05,YouTube Comment,dreador true but you have to factor in charging and how often you will need to charge and also factor in removing about 40 miles from the so called range the car has in winter
2023-01-09,YouTube Comment,marklola12 yeah i did thats why i said 75 miles not 115
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,i have had the icon version on lease sine april great car only issue i have had was aload of warning signs and sounds and it turned out the 12v battery was defected and had case damage and was leaking acid all sorted and enjoying it again i am 6ft 3 and have tons of room i have to have my drivers seat as far back as it can go but there is only me in the car so its a non issue loads of leg and head room the front of the car is pretty spacious and helps having the big space where the gear stick etc would normally be the only thing i have really is the rear view mirror blocks a bit of sight but the icon version does not have seat height adjustment so not sure if that would fix that as the position its in is perfect for everything else seeing the speedo screen etc the previous car was a petrol ds3 crossback lease which had way less room at the front not much leg room or headroom and also i had to have the seat set at its lowest setting and the steering wheel set to its highest but i still had litterally 1cm gap from the bottom of the steering wheel to the tops of my legs so as you could imagine steering was not that good as my hands kept getting stopped with tops of my legs due to hardly any cap
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,awful car no legroom in the back you can get a 2020 smart forfour eq for a lot less and has tons of legroom and only costs 15mth to service bad journalism when you dont do the full research
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,the smart is crap and its a city car you dont need a lot of room
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,aswin anbarasan agree but why offer a four seater which has limited use shame vag stopped making the upcitigomii that is a far better offering than the 500e more practical and a lot cheaper the 500e isnt worth the money
2022-12-12,YouTube Comment,ammaraihaan only problem is that they are still upmii a style free zone and most people for good or ill want a bit of style a year on and im still delighted with the 500e only real downside is lack of foot space but it give many smiles per mile to make up for that niggle
2022-12-12,YouTube Comment,bad journalism would be recommending a smart in a video about which is the best fiat 500e to buy
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,i thought the seat mii and vw eup had stopped production or am i mistaken
2022-12-13,YouTube Comment,they have i think some dealers still have stock though
2022-12-13,YouTube Comment,benrgrogan thanks ben i noticed they had disappeared from the leasing companys listing i use late last year when i was considering a replacement for my old car
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,far too much of this video focuses on features not enough of the car like how useable 24kwh is a lot more than reviewersauto journalists like to make is think
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,a few months ago i bought a 21 plate la prima for my wife and she absolutely loves it we were going to get a new icon but couldnt find one without a long wait then the used la prima was offered its excellent great tech lots of toys and dead easy to drive
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,an estate fiat 500 giardiniera was a badly missed opportunity
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,1 cost 2 range 3 proper buttons for heating etc one day hopefully i will be able to get past 1
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,your missing the smart car thats cheaper
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,but their range is less than 62 miles100 km and they are smaller than the fiat 500e
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,smart forfour eq has a lot more legroom in the back compared to the 500e and real life range is about 70 miles but it does have a smaller battery
2023-10-30,YouTube Comment,its a 42kwh battery not 85
2023-09-21,YouTube Comment,no dont buy electric to expensive and battery is rubbish and also its cheaper to fill up your car with petrol electric prices are going up so it will cost more to charge them petrol and also takes hours to charge its a massive no no keep to petrol
2023-06-19,YouTube Comment,738 the trackchange button is one of the rocker switches on the back of the steering wheel spokes the other sides the volume 😊 great review otherwise with excellent editing and care over composition and dialogue well done
2023-03-12,YouTube Comment,i have a question that is never addressed in these reviews are the indicators on the right hand side stalk
2023-06-19,YouTube Comment,lefthand stalk for indicators has a button on the end for deactivating the lanekeeping assistance which is useful lots of buttons back of the steering wheel has rocker switches for volume and nextprev track
2023-01-05,YouTube Comment,well seeing your asking would i have one over its rivals yes without a doubt but im a tall chap and i like a bigger car so will be setting my eyes after they are operated on for cataract removal on a skoda octavia self charging hybrid
2023-01-26,YouTube Comment,that is the only thing with the fiat 500 they only come in petite i do like skoda so im sure you will be safe with that choice
2022-12-29,YouTube Comment,im glad im not the only one that was surprised it didnt come with floor mats i was shocked when i collected my fiat 500e icon 87km that after paying for some of the extras packs they couldnt afford to add floor mats
2023-09-23,YouTube Comment,i thought it was yorkshire my favourite place to visit when i go to the uk
2022-11-20,YouTube Comment,that car looks like a suv next to you
2022-11-13,YouTube Comment,as an owner of a 2013 abarth 500 5spd and a 2015 abarth 500 6spd auto neither were a problem at all i am intrigued by this new forthcoming abarth 500 ev provided it offers improvements over the prior ice carsfor example is it quicker more torque irs improved interior front lsd and is it affordable
2023-06-19,YouTube Comment,were replacing our 2014 abarth 500c esseesse 160bhp with a topspec new fiat 500e equivalent of la prima less power and torque similar to a 14 nonturbo 500 lounge its going to be about two seconds slower 060 top speed some 30mph lower we never use top speed anyway but its a whole lot smoother and easier to drive without that awful gearbox no need for a limited slip diff as it doesnt have that surge of turbo powercant spin the wheels driving position is more comfortable seats are better its quieter and ride is smoother with the 400kg extra weight running costs will be a quarter or less our electricity is cheaper than in europe or the uk in nz we pay the equivalent of 6pkwh to charge at night when hydro power is plentiful our petrol is as expensive as yours fiat have oldtechnology batteries and motors compared to tesla so fiats ev is relatively slow and not as efficient my model 3 performance has 480bhp vs the 113bhp of the 500e yet the efficiency of the larger and heavier tesla is the same as the 500e and you can buy a used model 3 performance dual motor awd for the same money as a new 500e model 3 weighs no more than a similarlysized petrol bmw 3series awd thats probably why its such a great car multilink irs in the tesla compared to torsion beam in the 500e means theres not really any comparison in how the cars feel 500e will have that bouncy twitchy handling we know from the abarth drum rear brakes in the 500e the abarth 500e gets rear discs a bit more power 150bhp but costs even more is it worth it in the old abarth 500 compared to the lounge we had the difference in suspension tuning was obvious im not so sure that will be the case with the extra weight of the 500e platform the fiat 500e is also the same price as a brandnew basic model 3 which still has more than twice the power and 33 more range so its a nobrainer to pick the tesla better fastcharging options too reports of trim and build quality concerns are greatly exaggerated i dont think fiat will sell many 500e here basically its like buying an early nissan leaf but about five times the price and much more exclusive
2022-11-12,YouTube Comment,why do electric cars need a neutral
2022-10-27,YouTube Comment,took mine back after a week shocking battery life its a big no no went back to my petrol car

2022-09-04,YouTube Comment,i really like it and i would love one but the price just rules it out for me looking forward to seeing the electric abarth next year i dread to think how much its going to be
2022-10-29,YouTube Comment,i like it too i think if you can get it salary sacrificeleasethrough a business it helps with the cost a lot its honestly one of my favourite small evs i think the abarth will be pricey lets see
2022-08-27,YouTube Comment,in australia were punished buying electric we get slammed with a higher tax the government are working hard to prevent evs incoming so fiat hybrids havent even been released im waiting for the day i can finally own one of these
2022-08-25,YouTube Comment,0412 that boot isnt looking small from where im looking 😏
2022-11-22,YouTube Comment,shetalkscars i may need some convincing thats hands on 😜
2022-08-14,YouTube Comment,i love everything about it but the price thankfully fiats dont hold their value ill wait 3 years and buy it used for 10k by then all the caveats and boo boos should be known
2022-09-28,YouTube Comment,second hand cars have also a second hand batteries the most expensive part of the car
2022-09-28,YouTube Comment,pt020 in 510 years you can buy one dirt cheap and put a good battery in it they wont just throw away the car who know there might very well be a different battery at tenth of the price of todays lithium banks
2022-10-29,YouTube Comment,not the same in the uk used car market is very inflated at the moment and going to take some time to go back down electric cars seem to hold their value quite well at the moment
2023-03-22,YouTube Comment,piconano in 510 years you can buy one dirt cheap and put a good battery in it lol you know the car price is due to batteries currently being very expensive biggest cost is in the battery so if you pay for new battery then its back to square one some people
2023-06-19,YouTube Comment,johns4651also on the bright side the batteries in these newer evs have temperature management and arent worked as hard as in the early nissan leaf so the 500e will probably retain its capacity well and therefore retain good value on the used market especially compared to petrol cars
2024-02-25,YouTube Comment,now in feb 2024 the uk secondhand ev market has dropped considerably and getting a 20212022 fiat 500e is running at about 12 of the original purchase price we are hoping to get one real soon as with the price down to that level they really do represent a bargain all the talk in the comments here about batteries failing is complete nonsense fortunately so we have no issue getting a secondhand car and have full confidence that the battery will last the full lifetime of the car thanks very much for the review
2022-08-08,YouTube Comment,i have a celestial blue icon i love it more than any car i have ever owned
2022-08-09,YouTube Comment,lucky lady theyre brill glad to hear youre enjoying it lovely colour too
2022-07-06,YouTube Comment,fiat has done it again another winner for a fun nippy and sharp looking small ev we need more small urban evs why hoard the battery resources when we can share with other evs i have a 2013 500e and i love it i get a range of 201 km i get a full charge in 2 hours it doesnt have dc fast charging but i dont need it as level 2 charging can get a full charge in 2 hours the best feature about this ev is the amazingly small turning circle this particular 500e was only available in california and oregon from 2013 to 2018 as a compliance vehicle for chrysler to sell their ice vehicles in the us they actually lost 14000 selling each ev i am disappointed that fiat will not import any vehicle to north america anymore including the 500e so sad you guys can enjoy the car in the uk and eu
2022-07-16,YouTube Comment,thats sad although north america does get some cool cars that the uk doesnt maybe fiat will bring something else ev to north america in the future
2022-12-31,YouTube Comment,shetalkscars fiat has just announced in the la auto show that the 500e will be available in 2024 in north america way to go fiat i suspect they will sell a lot of 500e in urban centres but in rural areas its a different ballgame a longer range suv or pickup ev will be a better choice if the charging infrastructure can improve from its present status quo ie a lack of functioning charging stations in town and along major highways
2022-06-25,YouTube Comment,i love fiat 500s
2022-09-13,YouTube Comment,shetalkscars i had a 2 cyl twin air here in oz it was great except for the shitty dualogic transmission bought a new polo but its a bit of a non event and frustrating with practically everything wish the 500 didnt cost me so much in the end got scared and sold it
2022-06-13,YouTube Comment,i love mine just had a 550km ride to amsterdam fully charged in ams during my visit there plus a short coffee stop did the job for only 21 amazingly cheap compared to fuel nowadays last but not least fully deductible win win situation
2022-06-11,YouTube Comment,first review ive heard someone mention the red option thank you 😊
2022-06-08,YouTube Comment,gorgeous what colour have you gone for jay lovely car
2022-06-08,YouTube Comment,shetalkscars we have gone for the sky blue or celestial blue i dont know what its called in english 🙈 we just looked at it today and its awesome although the 12v outlet in the trunk is missing and the lock buttons on the passenger side and trunk door but that was to be expected we just waited 3 months for it which is awesome because we will drive it to our holiday destination in july fun fact the hole for the 12v outlet in the trunk is there its just covered with a plastic lid we asked if the dealership can build us one inside we will see 😊 the color is incredible in real life was definitely worth the 2000 extra 🙈
2022-06-09,YouTube Comment,jano1998 oh beautiful that colour is gorgeous ah thats a shame but glad they could find a solution for you enjoy your holiday
2022-05-21,YouTube Comment,class ironic that the two most desirable evs on the road today are the fiat 500e and the hyundai ioniq 5
2022-05-12,YouTube Comment,bought the 118 hp 500e passion 6 months ago in rose gold and love everything it range is about 160 miles with a light foot in mixed conditions including a lot of 60 mph driving and always in onepedal range mode chose the fiat over its rivals because it has analogue controls and paid under 25k for mine
2022-05-03,YouTube Comment,awesome review abi love the history youve added into this review and the details on the 500e is really good i do like the design loving your reviews lately presenting details and video production is ace 🙌
2024-05-31,YouTube Comment,wilsonyou are a paid shill to promote ev crap
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,no one wants evs
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,mac master is killing you on views 😂😂😂😂 evs are rubbish you should be embarrassed
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,fantastic car fiat have engineered a premium product that actually feels like it deserves that price tag
2024-05-07,YouTube Comment,very cute looking car
2024-05-06,YouTube Comment,the fiat 500e 28k to 14k in 1 year after 1000 miles driven however the arbath 595 14 tjet 24k to 18k in 1 year and 5000 miles at 40mpg the petrol for the 595 will cost 700 charging the electric will cost 220 at home or 500 at a motorway facility the 500e is great if you want to get rid of money
2024-05-06,YouTube Comment,how much have the electric car lobby paid you to speak positively about their scam vehicles
2024-05-03,YouTube Comment,fiats 😂and then a fiat ev 😂😂
2024-05-02,YouTube Comment,30000 for a car id want to live in it for that only use for that battery too
2024-05-02,YouTube Comment,34k for a fng fiat
2024-04-30,YouTube Comment,im amazed he doesnt think electric cars are just as lifeless as ladas if not more so
2024-04-13,YouTube Comment,ive only seen this advertised in two colors pink sorry rose gold and luckily there is red but its from project red which is for hiv research so i dont know how a str8 male could survive the ribbing driving the gheyest car of the century lol
2024-03-25,YouTube Comment,it needs to come down in price 4200000 canadian all taxes in is too much for a sub compact
2024-03-24,YouTube Comment,contact quentinfairchargecouk glad you like it 😎
2024-03-11,YouTube Comment,what an embarrassment to drive
2024-02-05,YouTube Comment,finger in throat reviewer no mention that there is no space for your left foot so dont try any long journies in this milk float 32000 for a 2 seater in which he praises with grear aplomb and then criticises it for having cheap plastics and he is so into cars he couldnt find the volume control from most reviews i have read on the fiat 500e you would be lucky to get 150 miles out of a full charge they are a nice little town car but no more than that but a very expensive shopping trolley
2024-01-31,YouTube Comment,so lets get it sorted the cheapest 500e with a wltp of 118 miles 😂 is 28k the same car with a 10l hybrid that has a combined mpg of 61 is 16k now it costs 10p a mile 135 for petrol so so you can go 120000 miles for on petrol for the extra 12k so whats the point seriously even if your on a super cheap ev deal with your electric supply and never ever go to a ripoff charger it will cost you more still have all the drawbacks of a ev dont pretend theres none because we all know the truth
2023-10-25,YouTube Comment,october 2023 fiat 500e club on facebook the high voltages in an ev requires mechanics to have safety training and special equipment may be needed in fact my nearest fiat dealer cant service my la prima because of lack of training and equipment
2023-09-22,YouTube Comment,quentin where did you get the idea that evs are better for the environment than ices not from robert llewelyn by any chance because he is totally deluded while we have in the uk some renewable generation they do not go to charging electric cars or heat pumps for that matter essentially electric cars are powered by gas it would be better to cut out the middle man and go for propane to power ic engines which would be far more efficient there are a large amount of losses between generation and consumer the reason is how our grid works nuclear and renewables run at maximum available at all times so cannot respond to the extra load evs put on the grid this is met by gas which can respond and provide the extra power the government put the horse before the cart they should have decarbonised the grid first but that can only be done by nuclear renewables havent a hope they are practically and technically unsuited for large scale grid supply dont take my word for it an inteligent assessment of this site shows real time grid performance httpswwwgridwatchtemplarcouk note particularly the red and blue in the second column of graphs red being gas and blue being wind and bear in mind that wind is always at maximum gas is variable and can rise to meet extra demand
2023-09-02,YouTube Comment,smart move to reduce the price as it was silly when launched the new mini will give the 500 some competition enjoyed the video
2023-08-29,YouTube Comment,its slower than many mundane cars from the sixties hardly progress
2023-08-29,YouTube Comment,i solove the fiat 500e its shape is just perfect but i disagreed its the best small car i have a zoe gt line and has a range of 240miles and can seat 3 in back just i paid approx 28k with renault discount at the time it has some physical controls and not all touch screen which i prefer yes its not perfect its not as good looking as the fiat call me a victor meldrew but i dont believe the high cost of small evs i wont be changing my ev any time soon but will continue to keep a close eye on fiats line up
2023-08-27,YouTube Comment,wish you would do more reviews quentin such a natural and fluid style and just takes me back to 90s top gear checking out the latest lexus or jaguar
2023-08-27,YouTube Comment,i still remember when quentin reviewed a lada riva lol
2023-08-27,YouTube Comment,the best objective review thank you how does it compare to some of the latest chinese evs
2023-08-26,YouTube Comment,34k for a small 2 seat car crazywait a couple of years and they will be half that price
2024-03-02,YouTube Comment,paulharrison7761 i have not my car is petrol 😎
2023-08-26,YouTube Comment,as an owner of a rose gold 500e with the 42 kwh drivetrain i agree with quentin most enjoyable car ive driven in half a century of motoring that includes numerous warm hatches such as the peugeot 205 gti
2024-02-07,YouTube Comment,totally agree with youonly a few cars have ever made me smilethis is 100 one
2023-08-26,YouTube Comment,its still a fiat a brand renowned for poor build quality and unreliability
2023-10-06,YouTube Comment,my mums had one fir years never had a days trouble so i got on if these suits me perfectly
2023-10-07,YouTube Comment,look again at the build quality of the all new 500e the 500e is built along side the maserati levante in the same factory in northern italy while the smaller petrol powered 500 is still made in poland we have ordered a 500e cabrio in rose oro with virtually every optional we have on our 2020 maserati levante gran sport diesel i see the same attention to fit and finish in both motor cars both are winners
2024-03-02,YouTube Comment,more reliable than the chargers youll be relying on though dont buy one
2023-08-26,YouTube Comment,i like mr wilsons reviewing style but evs cleaner air but at what price no lithium recycling facilities dirty dangerous lithium and rare earth supply chains including the sea floor licenced to be ploughed raped for more lithium the motor manufacturing industry is a corrupt shark that apparently has to keep swimming with a default position of that of liars what would suit the environment better are other forms of tech and we all keep our vehicles 1020 years but the industry just has to keep pumping out product evs emperors new clothes
2023-08-26,YouTube Comment,great review as always from the only car journalist who has transcended the worlds of tv car shows and youtube the 500e is selling well here in france too more cars of this size and perhaps the next notch up are needed especially now the fiesta is no longer in production
2023-08-26,YouTube Comment,would be greater if they made an honest 2 seater version with flat storage area
2023-08-26,YouTube Comment,id have one in a flash if it was just me and the wife in the house sadly and not sadly we have a full family to cart about so we need something bigger
2023-08-26,YouTube Comment,great review as always quentin
2023-08-26,YouTube Comment,looks great good to see some small cheaper evs
2023-08-25,YouTube Comment,quentin has not lost any of his charm great review
2023-08-25,YouTube Comment,please do more reviews
2023-08-25,YouTube Comment,still absolutely love quentins reviews so factual and honest i could listen to him reading the telephone directory remember those 😂
2023-08-25,YouTube Comment,quentins still has the same reviewing style 30 years later and im completely fine with this flashbacks to my youth watching top gear on a thursday eve
2023-08-25,YouTube Comment,can you review some diesel
2023-08-26,YouTube Comment,markustajahoyrylaiva but it makes it hard to review new diesels if there arent new models
2023-08-28,YouTube Comment,the whole industry is switching to electric drive trains and diesels are being phased out i think by 20302035
2023-08-25,YouTube Comment,still one of the best car reviewers in the business
2024-02-26,YouTube Comment,was it playing the theme from amarcord or had you turned it off im with those that think that the artificial engine noise is an essential safety item and you should not be able to turn it off or reduce its volume
2023-11-01,YouTube Comment,ok that was a good video i feel like i know what id be buying the key moment for me was the comment you made in case things go a bit fiat i think it confirms that this brand is an absolute writeoff in a lot of peoples minds me included
2023-08-29,YouTube Comment,opening windows and compromising aerodynamics is usually better than climate controls even at speeds as high as 70 mph its shocking even though it is quite noticeable at such speeds
2023-08-29,YouTube Comment,but wind noise from an open window at motorway speeds is utterly horrific
2023-07-11,YouTube Comment,love my 500e red edition wont go back to petrol now
2023-05-06,YouTube Comment,i have the cabrio always get that so much more fun even in spring and fall
2023-02-09,YouTube Comment,i enjoyed the video and for my wife that mostly drives locally and not far at that it would be a lovely car i would install a home charger and it would solve most charging problems at that nice job on the review
2023-01-06,YouTube Comment,in case it all goes a bit fiat said by the man who grinned like a cheshire cat after driving a 127 sport and a x19 same man who has 3 citroens 1 with a knackered engine 1 that wont run properly and 1 thats not being used in winter due to the fear of having to sweep it up with a dustpan brush come spring
2022-12-29,YouTube Comment,these electric cars should have a separate battery solely for the heaterclimate control a disadvantage though would also be having to wait to charge this battery
2022-12-21,YouTube Comment,fiat 500s are notorious for their electrical problems i cant imagine how horrendous this ev will be
2022-12-18,YouTube Comment,900 its somewhere to put the key if the battery in the key is dead so you can still start the car
2022-12-12,YouTube Comment,in some ways evs are good for the local businesses that are close to the chargers plus having to take a break for the batteries to recharge is good for forcing drivers to take a rest maybe more than they would have with the ices
2022-12-10,YouTube Comment,i just cant be bothered with all the crap that you have to deal with to maximise the range which is still crap l just want to get in and get where i want to go without all that shithaving said that i i do like hubnuts reviews on the older cars
2022-12-08,YouTube Comment,your complaining about the stalksthats the standard config for tons of cars since the 1900s mu 2006 scion xb has the exact same config
2022-12-08,YouTube Comment,i only worry about whats going on behind the plug what well need to do to further our power productions while simultaneously denouncing nuclear energy in so many places
2022-12-06,YouTube Comment,i wonder how the charging infrastructure is currently planned funded and negotiated will councils or other land owners wish to get fees for allowing installation or will businesses fund chargers in their car parks to get the inevitable coffee and snack selling opportunities in rural wales i wonder which way it will go and is there a chance of very local but not at home chargers proliferating
2022-12-05,YouTube Comment,the anxiety associated with everything having an impact on the battery whilst driving between two points with less opportunity to recharge is perhaps a greater mental distraction than having the ice on permanently it will remain a no from me
2022-12-04,YouTube Comment,why do we need manual override just make it manual i dont understand the way every one wants to make things electronic
2022-12-04,YouTube Comment,you have to ask yourself why they are pushing ev cars its not save the planet we all know that now so what is it do they just want the elite to drive cars this all stems from the right to buy scheme they want the lower classes to use the bus it keeps us in our place much like removing free education
2022-12-03,YouTube Comment,great video this i think its good that youve brought this to the channel because its giving us an insight into the world of electric vehicle ownership through the eyes of someone we can all relate too in real world conditions
2022-12-03,YouTube Comment,yep charge network is key ive run a tesla through work for a few years and its actually ok because the network is good and reliable and doesnt need cardsloginsdongles etc its also high output and the software in the car plans the routes of long journeys for you pretty well to keep charging stops brief the chargers also discourage people from sitting on them which helps with availability im sad they didnt keep the range extender type cars going we have an i3 as the run around yes its a hybrid but its the other way round ie a serial hybrid and as a result you dont end up using petrol at all often as most journeys are less than 100 miles in reality plus on a long run you can just use fuel for the faster bits its easy to refill and will run all day if needed you always have full power as the drive is purely electric unless you really run the battery low the weight penalty makes only a very little difference to economy and the petrol engine can be quite basic as it just needs to generate electricity but mainly you can avoid using public chargers
2022-12-03,YouTube Comment,so seats made from recycled coke bottles just dont drop some mintos on them
2022-12-03,YouTube Comment,i simply dont ever go for lunch or grab a coffee at services or other places where there may be public chargers the thought of constantly adding an hour to my journey does not appeal and a meal at services for a couple is going to add 1520 at least to the cost of that journey probably a lot more than what you may have saved in fuel though services charging isnt that cheap anyway i bloody detest motorway services and only ever nip in to them for the loo the thought of spending an hour there fills me with dread
2022-12-03,YouTube Comment,hubnut a real world test will be interesting ian as i said elsewhere in the comments this year we drove 1500 miles through rural france and i dont think an ev would have been practical or even possible for us excluding the initial purchase price an ev would only work as a second vehicle for local commuting and then cheaper home charging
2022-12-03,YouTube Comment,a car like this would only make sense for us as a second car with home charging capability our autumn trip through france doing 1500 miles just would not have been feasible or at the very least unbelievably inconvenient
2022-12-03,YouTube Comment,im not keen on electronic hand brakes they are on the cars i use at work i think id also not get on with all this driver assistance either too much like a bossy nagging partner seems like the backseat driver just got in the front and made me sit in the back as for the push button for the doors i hope it doesnt operate when the vehicle is in motion because that could be a serious safety concern
2022-12-03,YouTube Comment,good video reviewthis type of car price point what they offer is the sorta thing many of us will end up withor their replacements the initial cost of the 500 e is too high though especially considering its limited size as well public charging like thati dont have that much free time the range isnt enough not even in long range mode i know people will say its designed for local trips onlybut we arent made of moneytheres a recession on and we will need cars like this and cheaper in the future to double that range so they can be used as an only carmuch like we can do now with small petrol city cars little things to note my 2019 honda can read texts and allow me to use voice recognition to reply its a gimmickused it once doesnt work with other types of messaging eg whats app i also have led dipped headlights as well as led running lights rear lights quite surprised to see that fiat with that price tag only having halogen headlights my auto wipers are mostly good and sensible software means the rear wipe works normally at anytime and will auto wipe on reverse if the front wipers set to auto got the sensitivity adjustment as well not perfect tho collision warning and auto brake upto 30mph lane departure warning but doesnt take control of the steering cruise control manual automatic speed limiters speed sign recognition used for automatic im torn at the moment wether next time to go hybrid or jump directly to full electric depends on prices range charge times of batteries at that time expect if no better than now would prob go hybrid next few years critical also theres a cut off for new petrol diesels at the end of this decadehybrids have an extra 5 years with this in mind if we all wait til the last chance saloon they wont be able to make supply electric vehicles fast enough to meet demandexpect a long wait jump to early and you might be buying a model closer to this fiat which will by then be old hat technology with rubbish rangemaybe if it all comes together in next few years current petroldiesels will be next to worthless if it doesnt come together but gov still imposes the banyour current petrol diesel cars will be highly desirablevalues will soar and desperate people will be taking them without permission a 3rd outcome is that technology doesnt progress fast enough and gov move the ban to say 2040
2022-12-02,YouTube Comment,my issue with electric cars isnt the purity its purely environmental the battery has a lifespan of 100000 miles tops before needing replacement the lithium cobalt and nickel used in the batteries is mined in horrific working conditions often using child slave labour at gunpoint the environmental impact of this is huge while ev lithium ion batteries are supposedly 95 recycleable less than 5 of ev batteries are actually recycled the effects of lithium cobalt nickel etc when returning to the earth are slightly less horrific than the child slave labour but still really bad nickel mining alone is eating away at the rainforest and if the plans to make roads fully electric in the nearish future suceed it will accelerate this process 10 fold actually a lot more than tenfold but you get the point they are not sustainable or a long term solution and rely on third world countries with abhorent working conditions for production spending 510k for a replacement battery after anywhere between 25100k miles is financially and enviromentally stupid considering how many dirty diesels have done 250000 miles with basic maintenence hell most service diesels see 400k 1000000 with regular maintenence also not to mention that our electricity grid is barely holding up as is and is not nearly renewable enough it is simply not feasible for mass ownership as of now if you want to minimize pollution of cars which itself is a tiny figure of global pollution private jets cause more pollution than all of fucking denmark combined for example and thats still a small drop in the ocean figure out how to lower diesel tailpipe emissions as the compression ratios are high enough to run on non fossil fuels if you want to do your bit through what you drive buy a car any car new old diesel petrol etc and look after it the consumer throwaway culture is maddening to me personally petition for the government to auction off the cars held under the 2008 scrappage scheme even just for parts which ruined the 2nd hand car market effecting the poorest the most and generally being a senseless waste of perfectly adequate equipment tldr if you want to drive an ev because you enjoy it no worries just dont makebe fooled by the pretenses that it has any positive effect whatsoever on the planet thanks for coming to my ted talk
2022-12-02,YouTube Comment,didnt think lithium mining was anywhere near rainforest isnt argentina one of the main producers also 100000 is definitely not the limit for battery life plenty of evs have clocked up way more miles on their original battery
2022-12-02,YouTube Comment,hubnut rainforests in south america asia are rife with minerals like that i think i mistyped in the original lithium mining is mostly south american whereas nickel and cobalt is more asianafrican however the working conditions are simmilarly poor in all places ethanol production is also a huge contributor to deforestation mostly south america though ethanol fields are quickly eating up north american farmland im honestly glad to hear the battery life is better than i had heard im not so much an ev connoseiur so such news is reassuring i was just using figures id found from online sources over the years imo its far more of a political issue all around environment gov sanctions on petroldiesel muh freedoms etc than a fundamental issue with evs they definitely have their pros and i think a lot of people who live in a city would probably be better off with a small ev or even a quadrocycle or gwiz or something for their shop runs instead of a massive crossover as a side note love the content great watch as always keen for what the new year will bring
2022-12-02,YouTube Comment,i dont know hubnuts personal circumstances but i assume he would have off street parking which would probably mean if he owned an ev he could rig up a 240v 13a charge point shed or house roof mounted solar panels really make a lot of sense even in a rain blighted place like wales particularly when you own an ev
2022-12-02,YouTube Comment,nope home charging is not something i can do where i live youd need a pretty big solar array to charge an ev
2022-12-01,YouTube Comment,absolutely love the theory of it and a lovely looking little car bit too vauxhall adam imo compared to the original new 500 rather have an old fashioned 500 hybrid frankly at this stage charging is a faff and we are still not at a point where if we want to we can load up the car and nip off somewhere up north and it not take 12 hours to get there thats the deal breaker for me not keeping 3 small kids occupied while we charge up a large enough vehicle lol how fiat set up their auto wipers is a right pain though 500x is particularly annoying in that they werent even standard and even when optioned dont work properly attaching function of the rear to the fronts is just daft
2022-12-01,YouTube Comment,ive got one one on subscription from elm 140 is about right i found the range mode to jerky
2022-12-01,YouTube Comment,in case things go a bit fiat
2022-12-01,YouTube Comment,lets be honesteventually we will all have to have electric carsfor me at the moment its a no go as cant charge it home of worki am looking at modern hybridsbut will keep a gas guzzling classic for as long as i can
2022-12-01,YouTube Comment,do all the cars come with a parrot as standard
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,you dont get the joy of hearing your engine burst into life on a cold morning evs take the fun out of driving
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,i remember my first ev experience riding in a colleagues nissan leaf the figures would not suggest its particularly fast when he put his foot down out of the carpark it took off like a scalextric car no delay quite vicious acceleration aside from a v8 supercharged mercedes slk ive not been in anything quicker between 0 to 40 porsche boxster and aston martin v8 vantage included it was a similar story in the back of a hyundai kona only that felt like it was losing traction and a bit wayward and that was still pulling like a train at 60
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,that indicatorlight stalk does look like one i had in an alfa mito i had a big issue sometimes when indicating at night completely turned off the headlights this was somewhat scary on a dark country road quickly fixed but scary all the same hopefully theres a bit more resistance needed to change the light settings now
2022-12-08,YouTube Comment,i have the same stalk config in my 2006 scion xb and never had an issue
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,having had an ampera which is probably the only realistically priced electric car you can buy charging only works if you can do it at home a granny charger is ok for that if you only travel a few tens of miles a day at 10a everywhere else the cost of parking was more than the cost of charging and made it as pricey as petrol now with electric at 32p a kwh rather than 12p when i had my ampera these cars just arent cheap to run anymore
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,good real world review i dont have access to home charging either so its interesting to see how youre getting on i think in the future people will just charge their car whilst doing the weekly shop
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,another great video really enjoying the 500e content theres another cup holder in the front if you havent found it it pulls down front just below the parking brake button
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,as always a great honest review and interesting insight into electric car ownership thanks ian and miss hubnut i like the idea of the onto way that you can rent the car on a month by month basis it gives potential owners the try before you buy option im a bit on the fence with electric cars i love the clever engineering behind them but am concerned about their end of life recyclability as well as the fact their labelled emission free which they arnt really one other concern is the battery life a current petrol or diesel car is designed to have a life of say 10 to 15 years most evs and hybrids seem to have battery issues within 10 years and when the battery needs replacing its a write off due to the fact the battery is basically the floorpan of the car i have never been in a position to own a new car i think the newest was 6 years old due to the cost so if i decided to go electric then i run the risk of a battery towards the end of the cars life hopefully i will be proven wrong and future batterys will be more recyclable and last longer i think electric cars have their place but are not the future i think hydrogen powered cars are the future using fuel cell power its an exciting time to be an automotive engineer thats for sure
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,always love watching your reviews and so much better than any other channel as you test in real conditions and in a very relaxed manner i was a little sceptical about evs until i worked a few years at a main nissan renault dealership and drove many leafs zoes and others its the lack of any noise that surprises you as well as maximum power available immediately like many the only thing that prevents me from buying one is the initial cost and range anxiety it would mix well though with the occasional use of my old classic but very thirsty volvo which we currently run with a toyota yaris hybrid which is great to drive in town and ultra reliable like most toyotas
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,great review i love the whole idea of evs but to be practical i will need around 200 miles of theoretical range and sadly i will also need a secondhand vehicle with a purchase price of less than 12k and with no stupid hidden extras like the battery hired so i think im probably going to have a longish wait the closest i can see at present is the mg but whether the secondhand price will fall rapidly enough for me to ever own one before i finally hang up my motoring hat in about 15 years we shall have to wait and see
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,recently got given a e transit whilst my work van was in for service my first experience of electric life boy was it fast but boy was it not efficient i was getting 16 mpk miles per kilowatt glad to see had to drive to cambridge from norwich cost me 45 for 78 miles as it was 67 p per kw i believe car are there but infrastructure isnt and needs to be made universal as some could charge i some areas
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,great down to earth everyday not just a review on the vehicle but also the day to day situation of living with a electric car btw although in your situation it wouldnt make sense to put a charger at home what are the general costs if having a vehicle comparable charger put at home
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,good review like yourself i love electric cars but and its a big one the cost to buy lease timeshare one does not offset the cost of fuel for a car you already own however if you were looking at getting a new car anyway then electric has to be a very strong contender one like the 500 ev would suit most peoples daily driving needs
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,well i was suggesting this ten years ago wish id copyrighted the idea now it was only a matter of time before someone added noise httpsyoutube_efx35gpuky
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,i do like evs even being a diehard petrolhead the sheer cost is the main prohibitive factor what i really take issue with is how the government and users claim they are saving the planet with such vehicles and ice cars are evil and should be stamped out on both counts very wrong facts ev and ice ideally with synthetic fuels should live in harmony to provide the best of both worlds people need to look at the whole thing more but i digress great video ian and interesting take on living with an ev
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,i love the little 500e if we didnt need a bigger boot for mams wheelchair id absolutely be buying one have to admit i know evs do get a bit of a hard time from people whove never even sat in one but i genuinely think if more people would give them a go they really are great to own both our cars are now ful ev and i fully realise that they wont suit everyone but i just wish more people would give them a try before laying into them
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,a brand new car on hub nut anyone else wanting to know more about that sexy little red number behund it
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,im sure there will be a menu to change the rear wiper from mirroring to not linked also the step of intermittent time i had a corsa d that had menus to customise and the corsa d is a punto basically
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,around 2 kg of lithium in an eevee that can be recycled when its at the end of its life just like with 25 kg of lead in your current car battery is recycled so if youre going to complain about lithium mining for 2kg you should be complaining about crude oil which will use 10000kg in your car lifetime which isnt recyclable this is an answer to all those smug answers about im keeping my old car
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,a very interesting review thanks 🙂
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,anthropogenic extinction is going to be hell thank you for review now we need to ban toxic ice burning asp
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,thats a shame the gas powered 500 is being phased out i enjoyed driving the fiat 500 loaner car that the ford dealership gave me when my 2012 fiesta was in the shop under warranty years ago it was a fun car to drive i almost bought one but could not come to the agreement with the dealer on it i like evs but i have no way to consistently charge it up i live in a town house so no charger installation at my house is possible and i dont feel like haunting the local charger at the market all the time i also dont like the idea of wait times for charging when it takes 10 mins to fill up my 2018 hyundai and i am off and running plus evs are expensive and i dont feel the need to replace my 2018 hyundai which has less then 17000 miles on it for one and make payments i think evs are fine for folks that have a way to charge them at home but for 90 of the usa driving population it is not feasible
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,i did not know the fiat 500 was gaspowered is it lpgcng or perhaps hydrogen
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,pleased see more evs😁 no frounk not keen on fwd bit slow low range mmm fiat 500 could try harder 😉
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,day to day use the ev is king
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,i enjoy your reviews of electric vehicles you actually drive the cars in their intended mode and review the features fairly more factories need to listen to pragmatic feedback rather than relying on target group analysis you remind me of the wise old mouse in aesops fable when he asked but who will put the bell on the cat
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,very fair review that mirrors my own experience of living with a fiat 500e for a year especially the part about the enjoyment of onepedal driving with a light foot i get 4 miles per kwh in mixed driving but i would definitely not have bought an ev if i couldnt charge from home due to the lack of rapid chargers where i live in central scotland
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,quadruple the range and id be interested
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,i personally wouldnt have an ev i dont see it as the complete answer although it does have a place throwing away the internal combustion engine with over a century of development behind it isnt the answer either the real problem is the fuel they use petroldiesel what is needed is an alternative fuel that doesnt pollute
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,steam engines had 200 years of development before they were discarded
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,there are a few more internal combustion engines than steam engines
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,parknest yes 100 years later and now we are going to stop making internal combustion engines and there wont be many left in a few decades
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,come on ian since when does a man of your age listen to radio 1 😂 you gotta stop trying to be trendy and down with the kids 😉 electric car and mark goodier this month and an electric scooter next at this rate 😂
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,what i find perplexing is that these electric cars dont all have solar generating roofspanels seems a missed opportunity to my engineers mind i guess this video has paid for a set of brake shoespads for the rest of the fleet eh 😈😉 im a bit worried that your costs per mile are going to start having to include price of the coffees you are consuming while waiting for it to charge up
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,it cost thousands to make a curved panel and it barely adds 1 mile per day of range they are also heavy
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,prices starting at 30k you can get two petrol 500 pops for that 15k each the prices of ev are just way too high
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,great review ian its obviously very proficient at what it does and fiat have put a great deal of thought into it i love the styling inside and out and it all seems userfriendly such a short wheelbase is bound to be a bit bouncy particularly as the italians will set up the suspension for handling hence a bit firm with no roll try it on the road where you did the 2cv hoon down to reservoir a few years ago
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,great to see you in this car and get your take on where its all heading the onto option bring s affordability here where i expect prices will fall in a few years and of course by then there will used evs out there too great content thank you
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,good review of a normal electric car ive sadly come to the conclusion that the larger electric vehicles are bought on outright performance rather than environmental concerns teslas and audis are driven where i live with utter irresponsibility
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,great review just what a prospective owner needs youve never alluded to your telepathic abilities before no other explanation as to how you knew i was watching on the tv rather than tablet watched again today so i can make this comment that steering wheel looks nice and chunky to hold i think those people that are able to need to rethink attitudes to evs evs for daily and keep ice for leisure a place for both my home town in a survey last year was listed as in the top 10 worst big towns for public chargers in the country majority are in 3 multistory carparks and car dealers no street chargers
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,its really valuable to have an honest review from someone i can relate to not someone constantly comparing what theyre driving to a new tesla or jaguar ipace sadly there is as yet no way i could afford any ev other than a ten year old leaf with a range of 500 yards
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,that fiat computerised rear wiper interval really is a struggle i have a 2016 fiat doblo it doesnt have autowipers the rear wiper just wipes once every two sweeps of the front wipers however if you dont have the front wipers on it doesnt pick the slowest speed it wipes as if it was syncing with the front wipers on low continuous speed which is way too fast for just wiping spray the interval for both the front and rear wipers is also nonadjustable but speeddependant so at higher speeds theres very little difference between interval and low speed while at slower speeds the interval is sometimes too slow but it doesnt rain enough to select low speed continuous my previous car 2001 volvo v70 had adjustable interval from very very slow to alsmost continuous on the front wipers and two stages of rear wiper a nice mediumslow interval and continuous i liked that a lot better ow and to top it all off my doblo has the same wiper stalk situation as a multipla you have to twist the end for the front wipers and a ring for the rear wiper the stalk itself just moves up for one front wipe to the dash for rear wash to the driver for front wash
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,i cant wait to get an ev no moving parts nice and simple to maintain plus better for the environment currently the majority of cars are scrapped due to the engine being uneconomical to repair hopefully with simplicity of evs they will last much longer
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,i read somewhere that the service interval on the tesla electric motor is 1 million miles
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,never get the oh just have a coffee while charging i want to go somewhere and come back not endlessly handing around waiting on the car to charge
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,true but it is a good idea to stop every two hours something im notoriously bad at doing if the car allows me to just keep going
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,ah ha this lecky vid is an extension from yesterdays whimsical hippy response to the announced london ulez expansionamong with other british cities like most luvvies who dance to the tune of who ever pays them it seems that youre desperately trying to explain and discretely justify your acceptance of the kings shilling for lecky overpriced overrated plastic imported hypocritical nonsense will be amusing when your local council brings in a low emmision zone and perhaps youll see how it really feels eh
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,getting our tesla 3 on 1412 charge at home for 10pkwh with octopus works out at around 2p per mile no servicing ever apart from topping up washer bottle pollen filter every 20000 miles a 40 mpg cmax would cost 2600 for 12k miles the tesla 26700 no contest at all home charger pays for itself in months
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,tyres every 5000 miles it looks like youve fully swallowed the middle class imported battery car wet dream
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,toonmag50 im 6500 miles into my ev journey and tyres look brand new where have you plucked the 5000 mile figure from the worst car i have ever had for tyre wear was a rover 200vi lucky to get 8k from the fronts
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,magicrat yes yes and you replaced your rover with a bmw cos their sooooo fab similar yarns all over you tube yawn howevertesla original tyres are bespoke to them as if you fit normal tyres theyll only last 5000 miles didnt you know obviously not or you can pay 2500 for a replacement set of tesla tyres mind you lecky zealots like you and me rest of the middle class who are prepared to pay 60000 for a us placka pretend car wont mind paying 2500
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,toonmag50 i currently drive a model 3 only ever had 1 bimmer bit of a disappointment tbh the tesla oe michelin ps4 silent tyres are around 200 from kwik fit had a puncture the first week i had it and had to get one ordered in a similar price to the tyres on my last 4 cars to confirm as of today i have covered 6141 miles and the tyres are in excellent condition the windscreen however seems to made of sugar glass and chips at the drop of a hat this is my personal experience maybe i have just been lucky
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,fiat electronics certainly dont need a collision to fail time is all it takes and often not much
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,fantastic real world review of the 500e one of the better looking ev looks interesting with good build quality good to know about the charging network i would of thought these are going to have to get better in the coming months and years with the government pushing for more evi guess eventually they will tax the charging stations like they do at present for petrol and diesel otherwise they are going to lose a lot if revenue great review thank you to you both
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,excellent review like you my household run around in older petroldiesel vehicles like you i like evs and would love one like you i live in rural wales pembrokeshire main reasons i dont have an ev cost they are too expensive for me and range i regularly drive from pembrokeshire to the new forest to visit family 4 to 45 hours with a 10 minuet comfort break in our old clio i can get there run around and get back on a tank of petrol without out refuelling if i do need fuel it only takes 5 minuets maybe 10 if all pumps are in use and not 45 evs are getting cheaper and the charging infrastructure is improving but its not good enough yet
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,you are an anomaly a petrolhead that likes evs so much that you manage to make them work in a rural setting where they make the least amount of sense i like my diesel hatchback just fine but i live in a town large enough to have a rush hour and would be interested in a small light cheap ev with puny range to do the shopping with i think bmw i3 is kind of cool with its usage of carbon fibre but its still pretty expensive and compromises weight by trying to have long range maybe you can review an i3 in about 15 years im certainly looking forward to it
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,the ultimate hubnut car would be an early new york taxi originally and before henry ford poked his nose in electric was the norm in terms of technological advance who uses film or vinyl record on a daytoday basis and yet you can still play vinyl and for that matter cassettes and i still undertake photography projects with rolls of film and i use a handheld light meter setting the camera and lens manually sometimes i even use black and white film 😯😂 on balance technological advance is not bad but just an alternative
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,i looked at full electric but lack of charge points and the difficulty of getting a charger at home was one of the main reasons i went with phev going round rural lincolnshire watching the range deplete rapidly is something i wasnt wanting to experience
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,i had an outlander phev great car which turned out to be a gateway drug into full ev 😊 i dont understand the people who bemoan phevs they are absolutely the best solution for some people and dont get me started on the ev owners who complain about phevs using public chargers
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,i dont know im neither fór nor àgainst evs nor am i either fór nor against petrol driven cars i just enjoy the content from hubnut and cars in general😎
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,not having access to your own reasonable capacity home charging installation will very much colour your experience you will weary of novelty of lingering while public charging i do understand your are under inclusive program structure practical constraints for your trial project interesting following your impressions
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,im sorry to say it to you but this is the worst hubnut test ever boring boring boring
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,one car that is on my shopping list for next year major downside for me is the driving seat you only get height adjustment on the top spec having said that the convertible appeals
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,903 i dont know this car well enough however most vehicles with keyless start have a pad somewhere so that when the key battery is flat you can touch the key for the car to recognise the key often its on the steering column or around the starter button or randomly in the centre armrest like on mitsubishi
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,i dont think its hatered iain its the reterick on which they are being introduced to countries to say they will save the world is bollocks as the mear manufacturer disposal of electric cars is beyond explaining how indeed you could called them efficient when using cole powered stations that produce the electricity to change them not to mention safety issues with fire as you know the abilities to be functional in larger countries is laughable 199 kilometres is down the bloody road in australia
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,we dont use anywhere near as much coal here as australia less than 1 of our power is coalfuelled
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,hubnut good luck with affordable heating this winter wake up our world is in real danger if not for you then your childrentake care
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,what a horrible little piece of pointless tatt without an engine its of no interest to me when the day comes you can only have electric thats the day me and cars are over
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,this is the type of car reviews that i like you have the car for a month and use it in all conditions great insite ian
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,what a cool little car im actually quite happy watching someone whos opinion i trust doing a review on these things as it is more or less inevitable that one day we will be forced to use one as a daily and keep the classics for special occasions only also wales is more like the terrain i drive on here in nz so any results you get are more likely to be closer to what i would get myself so 140 miles 230km approx in rangeand you have a network that supplies free charging which will never happen here due to habits of the political nature that sounds perfectalthough i would like to see something closer to 400km minimum so i can get to whitianga and back 320km without having to stop at the closest topup point about 85km short of my destination and a 5km diversion to top up both on the way there and back this might not be possible in a smaller car as yet but they will get there about the time i want a car that size love the appearance of quality on the interior tactile surfaces and that door chonk certainly sounds good too how do recycled plastic seats feel to sit on it will be interesting to see how they last and whether they eventually crumble or melt in the hot summer sun uv potentialand whether they burn ones thighs in summer like the old vinyl seats do it sounds good in theory thoughand the car looks to be a fairly practical one for a twoperson household but you couldnt go shopping with the kids on board eh great review from the pair of you much obliged all the best
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,gov will load up road tax and electricity price go into orbitthen sheep realise they been shafted and left with a hugely devalued piece of rubbish
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,nice looking car i have to say the interior is a bit spoiled by the big ugly screen stuck in the middle like an afterthought wish it was an option to have no screen
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,electric cars brilliant in rural areas if you can charge at home mine is usually 90 wind powered and 10 hydro going by my local grid
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,im completely with you regarding how much fun evs are to drive i have the added bonus of living in a province where electricity is still very cheap and clean and government incentives are high unfortunately in its slow death fiat canada has not seen fit to import the 500e in fact only the standard 500x is currently catalogued
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,evs have been rather forcefed and forced upon people who use vehicles but i predict that they will a 25 year fad at most at least the full battery ones it is no coincidence that toyota honda suzuki the koreans and numerous us companies are developing hydrogen cells or straight hydrogen gas because of the ultimate limitations and rarity of battery materials we shall see this go hand in hand with green power generation being stored without chemical batteries and heavy commercial vehicles needing something akin to icus we see this is trains already and russia with japan is reserving whole islands in its far east for energy generation and storage when blue red or green hydrogen reaches the right scale of economic production then battery cars will cease and will have been an interesting stopgap
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,a nice looking over priced golf cart
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,have you driven a mitsubishi i imiev in the us that seems like a perfect blend of ev and crude nugget for your channel lol though the extremely low range probably makes that car one of the most rare earlier evs
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,i havent was considering a czero badgeengineered version but the short range was a bit offputting
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,hubnut would be nice if somebody would design some way to put much better batteries in older evs to keep them viable iirc there was a company in portland oregon that puts newer much larger capacity batteries in early leafs e v rides but thats only possible because nissan upgraded the later leaf and that battery can be made to work in older ones just through dumb luck of part sharing i guess
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,ian firstly l agree with you on the design of the fiat 500 of all the retro cars with the exception fiat got it right the first time l saw one they got it so right the only real gripe l have with it no spare tyre not even a space saver l think a luxury item you can get on most 4x4 and comercial vehicles is full size spare tyre an essential part in australia especially
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,great to see an ev review mrh its been a while keep them coming its good to see your realworld experiences
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,purchase price range and having to plan any trip around charge points are a real negative for me and id be interested to know what sort of trade in value an ev would command
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,no contingency for driving into a pond and getting out when your electricks go kaput i guess its low odds but then shouldnt the natural response to driving 60mph in a metal box be to scream were all going to die
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,news your current car will conk out if you drive it into a pond
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,ive been distracted flairside tranny photo im sure ive driven petrol v6 thudly
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,neither are original fiat 500 all the electrics are failing
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,enjoyable and interesting test i am and always have been a car bus truck bike train enthusiast and it doesnt matter how theyre propelled
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,has anyone informed british layland that fiat has stolen the sherpa name 😉
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,charging infrastructure is woeful in wales the government had a big role out of fast chargers last year and installed 22kwh chargers hardly fast
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,if the electric fiat 500 is a brand new platform why is the ride still as awful as the ic version manufacturers are in a transitional stage which means all were going to get for the next few years are experimental partsbin frankensteins
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,hubnut a search of suspension parts for the new 2020 fiat 500e appears to show the front arms are compatible with the lancia ypsilon from 2011
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,if you get down to 0 miles range you will have 1012 miles in tortoise mode audible or visual warning which gives one miles to get off a motorway at 30 mph automatically slowly reducing or to a charge point there is one dedicated ev rescue company that will do a roadside charge at 75 kwh diesel generator with enough to get you to a charge point the rac also do that the others recover the vehicle either to a charge point your destination if closer than a charge point or back home but the electronic handbrake is a problem as when at absolute zero in the battery completely dead it comes on once stationary and cant be released until some juice back in it a lift onto a flatbed is needed
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,it looks pleasant enough to drive but the charging business is still too much of a faff for me i am not ready
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i like the look of it and as a city car it makes sense especially the one pedal driving i live in a rural area and the very fact you good folks need to plan charging take into account hills and heater power consumption immediately is a red flag for me in terms of practicality i have a friend with an electric car who twice has been low on charge due to charger availability when they had an urgent need to collect the kids from school 5 10 mins at a petrol station suits me better for now
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,too much tech for my liking and i loathe manufacturers electrifying things like doors and handbrakes just headaches in the future when they go wrong
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,looks very nice and greatbut one thing worries me is that display unit showing you all about whilst driving distraction
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,the little fiat looks sound but still the charging is a faff infrastructure isnt ready yet in my opinion
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,im not anti ev but id have such range anxiety and its not a 5 mins trip to the fuel station to fill it up i guess things will improve over time but ill never own one
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,hubnut that it does yes though i think its just as pointless on those cars as well if you have a mechanical release thats known to be very reliable generally and does the exact same function why would anyone need to add electronic releases in the first place i find a lot of things like that with modern cars im not against modern cars but theres this trend to add things that arent really necessary in my eyes backup cameras for example i understand how theyre useful on large commercial vehicles like trucks or vans or big suvs but here in north america theyve been mandated on every vehicle why does something like a small crossover or hatchback need a backup camera its not large so should be fairly easy to park using the rear view mirror or side mirrors in places like here in canada where poor winter weather means that cameras are just going to get covered with slush and snow and ice as youre driving or salt spray thats kicked up from behind the car on wet winter roads the camera lens is going to get all dirty and blurry and useless anyway but a plain old rear view mirror inside that has done its job perfectly acceptably for decades is not let alone the repair cost if your rear view mirror breaks you just glue another one to your windshield if youre backup camera breaks its likely hundreds and hundreds of dollars to repair at least here in canada led headlight assemblies are another example im not against leds as they provide superior light put modern cars have the leds embedded in the assembly meaning if one of the leds burns out you have to spend potentially hundreds or even thousands on expensive cars to replace the entire assembly for one burnt out led why not design the housings to have replaceable led bulbs that use the same standard sockets and contacts that weve had for decades rather than spending thousands to replace the entire assembly you could just swap the bulb out as weve done but still have the benefit of leds sorry for the mini rant haha just some observations ive had
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,dont worry about running out of charge there are breakdown companys that will come to the rescue with a diesel generator
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,not my cup of tea either paulie neither is the car driving me with its supposed safety features surely these things are taking the skill out of driving or am l being just an old fart that is stuck in the past lol
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i wonder how much cheaper in fuel this will be to run compared to a petrol equivalent doing 50mpg considering you need to use commercial chargers
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,i worked out that at current prices public chargers work out about the same as a 50mpg diesel
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,hubnut im not surprised even though theres hardly any tax on electricity is there vat on commercial pump electrickery electric cars are going to be very expensive to run if using commercial charging points when tax is raised to collect the equivalent of the tax on liquid fuel today which must happen over the next few years and certainly by 2030
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,hubnut i should mention that for the business traveller working for a vat registered company that already makes the electric car more expensive than diesel they claim 20 back from hmrc on their fuel plus average modern diesel cars easily exceed 50mpg on a run
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,had ev car as a courtesy car while my company car was in for service i can do over 200 miles a day cant stop to change for hours the car was good but getting the car back to the garage i had ten miles range left did not ring it neck out got regen when i could did not trust it as my daily work horse
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,passed a hyundai stuck on the hill out of llwyncelyn the other day where you pass regularly that had presumably run out of charge when i came back it had moved into the layby the other side of the road with the assistance of the aa van and man i wonder though how it moved from there its not as if they could get a couple of gallons of petrol from the filling station 250metres back down the road i guess that they might have had to pay a truck to carry the car to a charger somewhere possibly 20 miles away at aberystwyth
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,a great update on the electric 500 journey ian and carly what really makes this is the real world use of the car in suboptimal conditions for an ev great work and i look forward to more real world life with a small ev many thanks for sharing
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i urge you to research the hyundai bayon fascinating little car and i can honestly say from experience its a little starif not a tad quirky looking
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,our local charger in oxford is part of franklin energy which is listed as being supported by shell recharge which is free for onto users
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,and what exactly is powering the charging coal gas nuclear consider these things as an electric car is an utter lie
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,in the uk past year was 43 fossil fuels renewables 34 nuclear 17 but the environment isnt my main motivation to drive one i just like evs
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,you said that the 500e was controversial how can such a gorgeous car be so i love it and if it was a fraction larger i would get one one thing that would annoy me would be having the one pedal driving only available in eco mode why cant it be available in the other modes too it is such a good feature to have in an ev much underrated i think i can concur that the charging infrastructure in wales is lagging behind the rest of the country my family and i went to south wales from shropshire for a holiday this summer and we went cross country the levels of anxiety reached exceeded any i have experienced in an ev i think it may have been at around the same time you transferred twk to its new home as we experienced torrential rain too we were ok once in and around carmarthen but decided to take the less scenic motorway route back to save our nerves looking forward to the forthcoming additional 500e reports
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,in range mode it feels much like normal mode in terms of power but with stronger regen to allow that onepedal driving sherpa dulls the power a little but you can always accelerate through it by just flooring it if you feel the need to get a shift on
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,hubnut thanks ian i have a kia soul ev in which you can also override the dulled power delivery in eco mode to get full power when needed trouble is it doesnt feel as nice as the responsiveness when in normal i imagine the 500e might be the same
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,jwsoaresjones1560 you will have to trawl through some more hubnut to answer this ill get you started twk is the letters of the registration of hubnuts invacar enjoy
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i have a petrol 500 cost 10685 with 25 miles and 2 months old list price was about 14000 at the time the website shows the 500e at 30000 plus dont show the lower priced one anymore i have only done 7200 miles in 35 years so in theory the car would be great for me pottering about locally but i could buy an awlful lot of petrol for the extra cost these are even the honda e is getting on for 30000 i would love one just for the quietness and auto but not at that price
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,appreciate the honest review whilst evs will work for some i dont think theyre quite ready to replace the internal combustion engine theres too many compromises that need to be made having to chose between heating and range is a choice i dont think anyone should be forced to make i still believe that evs are just a stepping stone until we get to the long term replacement for the combustion engine whether thats hydrogen or even synthetic fuels neither or which seem to get much attention due to costs but i wonder where wed be if they got the same sort of investment and development as evs
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,the fiat brand was removed from our market in 2020 low sales i hear the 500e will return in 2024 its 11 c today and will be 15 c tomorrow overnight lows at 24 c we shall see how they fare here butnot looking promising
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,stephenholland5930 western canada north alberta batteries lose 30 of the charge in the winter here below minus 18 c even petrol engines need block heaters for overnight in cold weather
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,automatic wipers headlights and reverse camera are really the 3 modern car conveniences i like seems like a great little car would love one especially as my first car was a 1967 fiat 500
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,excellent review someone at work has one of these and it really attracts attention however im clearly showing my age here but i really hate all these information overload screens and a lack of real dials not a computer graphic of same some time ago i rented an amgline mercedes aclass and it was to me anyway utterly hateful the lane departure nonsense which scared the crap out of me the first time it kicked in and helpfully told me how much braking force it had applied the screens that you could change the theme of and all the touchscreen nonsense no thanks maybe someone needs to design an ev for old fuddyduddies like me who just want dials to read and knobs to turn i do like onepedal driving though
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i agree 100 and if you turn a feature off it needs to stay off until you turn it on again why is looking at a mobile phone whilst driving considered dangerous whilst touch screens flashing warnings at you arent
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,cornishhh iirc the rented aclass i used as an illustration did that off only until you turned the ignition off a corsa i rented stayed off until switched back on it does worry me that people seem to be keen to hand control of their vehicles to computer systems even simple stuff like automatic wipers and headlights a foggy day seems to fool the latter on many cars with touchscreens i find im looking more at the screen trying to guide my finger onto the target area for a function than i am the road yet i can easily do the same function by feel and without taking my eyes off the road when there are knobs or switches
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i would not want an electric car as a presentwhen i go anywhere i dont want to continuesly doing the math to see what im doing and will i ever get home again because some charger is not working i have a fuel gauge in mine i can telli think that electric cars are nothing but a pipe dream they dont workok for someone beatleing around town but no good at all for anyone doing milagecrap burn them all go buy a good euro 6 diesel
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,are the washers referred to as multijet great video makes me want to get my electric car sooner you raise a good question which you could answer more range with climate control on and windows closed or climate control off and windows open i think mythbusters performed a test on petrol engined cars once and windows closed ac on was more economical lots of information in this video
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,it depends on speed the faster you go the more the drag created by the open windows matters
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i just love this car
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,anxiety would not let me drive an electric ev there is too much to worry about
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,see i still cant justify this scheme for the sort of money this fiat costs a month i could get a more substantially better hybrid ok not brand new but still fairly new over 48 months including running costs and without limits but at the end of the 48 months i would own the hybrid where you would be giving this fiat back at least with the hybrid i could sellpart ex it an get some of my money back so this scheme is not for me
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,interesting insight it would be interesting to see how much you spend on coffee that you only bought because you felt obliged to do something to fill the charging time
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,zero ev roadtrip video coming soon and i only bought fooddrink i genuinely needed
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,turn the engine on tut tut mr hubnut there isnt an engine
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i am going to miss the days when all that was needed was a fuel gauge brake regeneration the outside temperature how hot the heater is really to compare the fiat 500 to a mobile phone just summed everything up for me im not a hater or electric cars i just love everything about the combustion alternatives thanks for confirming this for me
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,cornishhhme too if i decide its safe to straight line a corner i dont want the car to stop me maybe it can be switched off in the abarth 500
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,fascinated by electric cars so keep them coming i reckon have had my sons volvo xc40 recharge twin for 10 days while he was on a bush walk yummy 😆
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,just a note headlights being halogen or led doesnt make any measurable difference of course it doesnt hurt either in the real world for range of evs in anything but city driving its a common misconception they do though but its easily disproven in you think about power consuption of headlights vs how much it takes to push the car forward best case scenario the leds save you 70 watts so about 1kwh for 15 hours driving unless my brain is fried from todays long shift thats quite a bit less than 1 in most conditions or entirely within the margin of error cheers
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,do elec cars brake lights come on when using the re gen or do we run up the back of them cheers a j speed
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,while i would never own an ev i think this is an interesting service if you could use it for just a month it might be a fun way to experience an ev without having to own one i drive a hybrid as a daily and while i dont really like it it is actually a good car
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,onepedal driving is for me the biggest attraction of electric drive for reasons ive recently been driving a toyota porte jdm yaris based and having to use mechanical brakes to slow down seems unspeakably primitivesuch a waste of energy and wear on consumable parts i used to fly gliders and driving electrically reminds me of thatsmooth silent go with the vehicle doubtless not much fun on a track day but definitely the future and good to remember that electric is the real heritage motoring as there were good evs before ice was convenient
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,my car does one pedal driving its a 62l v8 petrol the engine has massive deceleration on the overrun you barely need the brakes its great you should try one
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,wibblywobbly1234 i am 78 and have no kids so climate change is of no personal interest to me but i think it would be nice to help you lot who will have to deal with it
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,michaelwright2986 you are the carbon they want to eliminate
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,wibblywobbly1234 i really think you should try to understand why the mention of electric vehicles inspires such rage and hatred in you of course we dont have to give up ice if energy companies can succeed in making synthesised hydrocarbons which are also the only plausible solution for aviation perhaps if you devoted your energies to getting the oil companies really working on that every body would be better off
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,michaelwright2986 synthetic aviation fuel manufactured from hydrogen and atmospheric co2 is possible but currently twice the price as fossil fuel that will change in time
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,mbak7801 only twice the price given the fluctuations in oil price and the externalised costs of fossil fuels thats pretty encouraging even at that price it could keep an original lotus elite viable though maybe not a 63 l v8or alas a big six aussie
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,the shortest road journey from our home in sussex to charing cross is a mere 49 miles the mobile phone signal at home is nonexistent not just a bit patchy nonexistent no mobile data at all there are no street lights and most houses in the village centre where we live have no parking at all there are 1500 residents not a single public charging point my 6 year old vw polos trade value has increased by at least 2000 in the last 2 years something tells me that although the corporate vampires want us to conform it will be decades before the infrastructure and pricing make ev cars affordable for all and even then it still should be a choice right anyway i love your channel and i love what you do always interesting thoughtful and deft turn of phrase thank you ian miss h you always brighten every day and no need to drive around looking for a charging point 😎
2023-09-29,YouTube Comment,sussex is letting the side down is there anywhere that you can complain range rover friendly no doubt but not friendly for evs not good
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,had my tesla model 3 since august i have always had family based cars almost always petrol but decided to spoil myself and buy the tesla i cannot ever see me going back to a ice car i love everything about it as i have off street parking and had a charger installed at my home i have never used public charging except the free pod points at tesco when they were free and i was getting my shopping and a bit of breakfast i also used it on a break in the cotswolds on arrival at the hotel found it had free to used tesla destination chargers so woke up every morning to a full tank for our day of touring around the area on our return journey went from not far outside gloucester to blenheim palace and return to port talbot without the need for an additional charge it is a real treat to wake up in the morning and head for work with seats and steering wheel nice and warm or cool in the summer very odd to not have a servicing schedule and any software updates received over the air overnight
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i like the sherpa mode im sure thats fiats tribute to the electric freight rover sherpa van of the 1980s there really was one i would love an electric sherpa van but as far as i know theres only one left in ipswich transport museum i believe the museum keeps it in working order so perhaps a hubnut test drive might not be out of the question
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i enjoyed that i have been lucky enough this year to be able to own a 2021 kia after 30 years of buying sub3k cars and im staggered at the difference in quality the supply chain of components to the auto industry has improved markedly in the last few years difficult to buy a bad car now and thankfully those days are behind us i fully embrace new stuff now and never thought i would i could see that you both appreciated this about the fiat of course i still love watching your spannering capers whilst also enjoying this touch of modern stuff keep it coming 😊
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,to some extent the demand for batteries etc will probably exceed most supply therefore is it better rather than govt 15 year car scrappage proposed one should look at vehicles that are going to be used more each day such as delivery vehicles rather than the school run otherwise that is a lot of lithium just standing around each day
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,querying why the doors need to be opened electronically what is the benefit its ironic that climate controll uses as much energy for heat as it does for cooling seeing that there is no engine to heat the air i think that you need a home charger if you are to have an ev permanent ally i think all cafes near charging points will do well
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i too like internal combustion engines but am not against electric vehicles they make a lot of sense in the way that they start with things going round and round instead of up and down full torque form zero like a steam engine quiet and refined early horseless carriages were powered by electric motors but even then as now the batteries are the problem and ices still have the advantage there is no real environmental or cost advantage air pollution just gets moved to somewhere else and by the time the manufacturing harm is recovered the batteries will be tired and need changing for new ones they should be seen as an alternative and not a replacement we should have choice and not a government diktat
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,awesome video as an ex truck driver i never look out the rear window i just use the side mirrors
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,an interesting and thought provoking watch i dont consider myself strongly pro or antiev i can see pros and cons to both sides of the debate in my own case the almost total lack of charging facilities and some grave concerns about methods reportedly used to obtain raw materials in parts if africa but thats a separate debate all by itself stop electric vehicles being a practical proposition at present i would also prefer a car thats more straightforward to operate as i find things like menu screens etc distracting and a lot of what they display is info i dont really feel i need i shall be watching future developments with interest though
2023-09-11,YouTube Comment,most evs dont use the raw materials in parts of africabut all fuel is desulpherised by such raw materials if you really had grave concerns youd change but do you really or just want to throw stones
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,the autoon lane keep assist on the ev mii i had used to annoy the bejesus out of me you could with an obd2 dongle make it remember you turned it off but i think the autoon thing is part of the insurance rating so beware
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,seems the ideal car for miss hubnut just download some engine sounds and ya good to go great review i could see you guys in an ami the new ones
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,cant wait till you take it apart when it goes wrong hubnut style only joking but it would be fun good vid on the ev i would love one but the range somewhat puts me off
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,unknown scares people and i have no problem admitting that evs scare me immensely also i dont think ill ever get over the range anxiety and 40 minutes of usable charging times not that i can afford any ev as of now but i cant see myself in one thanks for the review guys you are the best
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,a thoroughly marvelous roadtest and a superb insight into ev life looking forward to the the cable situation video also good times
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,this is a real test just daily use from a to b the time of year now also gives a good impression of the consumption of the kw in poorer conditions im curious to see the overview in a few months or how long you have had this 500e
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,its an utter pain in the arse im all for safety but this is stupid
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,hubnut i worry that if youre driving so tired that lane departure is a real possibility then you really shouldnt be driving at all
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,just ignore the haters i think this is a very interesting complement to the regular hubnutfleet and besides i may be a total renaultofthepatricklequementeranerd but that does not stop me from fiding the majority of cars interesting in one way or another even ugly ones or the ones i would never buy are interesting to know more about about evs totally agree on the adictive nature of regen and onepedaldriving absolutely love that i also like the opposite i had the chance to testdrive a mercedes eqs love it even if it represent a type of car i normally dont care for and while driving on the motorway with no regen i lifed off and let the car coast its slippery aerodynamic body made it stay at the same speed with no tedencies to slow down it just kept on gliding through the air effortlessly an amazing sensation also i agree on the horrors of lane departure warning systems i hate them have driven a volvo xc60 did not like any aspect of it and a tesla model y better than the volvo but still nope where the system kept on calling my attention like a neurotic backseat driver enfuriating especially the volvo since i was driving on very similar countryside roads as you drive on and the warning system was working overtime eww
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,one of my grips with evs iswas their tendency to reinvent every element of a car for no reason other than to appear futuristic however now the technology is maturing manufacturers are starting to make their evs a bit more conventional which appeals i think this fiat and the peugeot e208 are examples of this
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,yes there was a tendency to make evs look a bit out there initially
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,completely agree and that didnt help the ev cause because everything electric or even hybrid tried to look futuristic but usually ended up looking lame and aged badly
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,the over use of touch screen and undersupply of buttons annoys me but its a trend on ice vehicles too
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i do like the one pedal driving idea because a lot of the time i drive my petrol manual car like that only using the brakes when completely necessary and adjusting my speed with the throttle and gears means that i always have my eyes the road which is no bad thing and better than these folk having an affair with brake pedals i dont care what powers a car although environmental considerations are a priority but as long as i can drive then it can run on peanut butter for all i care
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,in the last 5 years seven yes seven housing estates have gone up bringing a huge influx of new cars there are 2 functioning public chargers there were a few others behind a council building then they put a covid testing centre there and within its perimeter fencing so they were inaccessible for that period now to cut costs the building is up for sale and the chargers are no longer connected to the grid until there is a proper commitment to the infrastructure they can urge us all and put as many ulez areas in as they want to but its not practical in the projected timescale
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,the wireless pad with key icon is probably the location to place the car key if its internal battery is flat assuming it has a remote key
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,glad you enjoyed it ian but its still not for me the environmental concerns are major downsides for me and the lack of charging infrastructure coupled with mileage anxiety would make it a scary experience thanks for sharing your real world experience of living with an ev and not in a city
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,ive done 85k rural ev miles the range thing you quickly learn to not be bothered about you charge at home 999 of the time anyway
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,you charge at home if you can we cannot
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,hubnut if you were committing yourself to ev ownership and couldnt charge at home youd really need a good number of loweffort choices for public charging or you might find yourself in a hole personally id find going off somewhere special to charge every day would be unworkable plus theres the cost with public chargers paying vat at the full 20 vs maybe an off peak tariff at home of course electricity prices are away in lala land right now
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i always had a whine at all speeds in the last three cars i owned strangely after my divorce the whine stopped
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,im not sure the charging built in to the cost is worth it if you have off road parking you really need a home charger because then the car is simply charged and ready for the journey in the morning you also need an economy 7 style cheap rate tariff then it becomes 1p to 2p a mile for me i still have a 5pkwh cheap rate at the moment but 7pkwh deals can still be found which is still under 2p per mile the problem really is when you dont have off road parking then you are at the mercy of the public charging network and that really is less convenient than petrol
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,902 if its anything like bmws and audis that little key icon will be where you put the key should the key battery be flat so you can still drive the car
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,489 a month or 5868 per year is a lot of money for most people it would be cheaper to run an older car than to build a new electric car and the effects on the environment in doing so with batteries only lasting 10 years its a waste of money sadly an affordable technology is not there yet hopefully in another 10 years things may be different
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,who says batteries only last 10 years new evs arent aimed at devotees to bangernomics theyre an alternative to a new ice car
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,grahamleiper1538 like the batteries found in electronic gadgets like smartphones and laptops electric car batteries degrade and become less effective over time this reduces the cars fullycharged electric range given enough time and repeated charging
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,gpsomg because car batteries dont have thermal management always charge to max and dont have massive redundancies built in these arent managed like phone batteries or laptop batteries tesla rate their batteries as designed for 500000 miles so 23 years
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,man i hate fiat and now with no engine
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i could be attracted to an ev but why oh why are they all designed by twelve year olds who think its really cool to load them with every pointless powersapping unreliable and irritating gadget ever dreamed up its like they were all designed by some tosser from microsoft whos got bored with updating windows every five minutes and turned his hand to car design im convinced that if someone came up with an electric equivalent of the 2cv or morris minor theyd make a mint windup windows yes please
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i like the idea of single pedal driving ive always thought that should be all you need on an electric vehicle perhaps a centre pivoted heel and toe pedal
2022-12-03,YouTube Comment,would be just my luck to jump back in an ice car and forget
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,electric cats are ok but unless for towing anything still far to long to recharge and the range lies more than boris
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,finally a non fanatic judging an electric car and it is what i expected it is for people with their own parking space with their own charging facility
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,neither are needed if you live in london if you have a subscription car from elmo there is a period of free electricity only a few months from a charge supplier they have around 4800 charge points across the country with around 4500 in london yes london as usual with 10 of the population gets over 90 of the resources it is seething with charge points so charging is no problem
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,its not a good sign of fiats own self confidence that there are almost no badges of theirs on the car anymore only on the bootlid theyre so sure that the 500 on its own matters more than their entire brand history outside of it that theyd almost rather you didnt think about them directly
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,but see also cupra ds and any number of premium ranges of motor vehicles the 500 has become a brand in its own right
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,cool little car great review however what we really need to know iswhat did you settle on for lunch 😅
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i never thought id live to see the day when hunbut of all people would start to complain about his car lacking some modern frivolity such as a bloody heated steering wheel this is almost sacrilege kinda like seeing the late great fred dibbnah forsaking his flat cap for a tiara
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,do not forget electric cars are powered by lithium ion batteries which contain cobalt 60 of which is mined in the democratic republic of congo it is estimated that 40000 of these workers are children who are small enough to crawl along the narrow shafts and have to remove the cobalt with their bare hands
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,there is a reason why cobalt is being phased out of ev batteries thats it but dont forget it isnt just evs that use lithium ion batteries
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,dont forget your car uses 10000 kg of crude oil on its lifetime which is not recyclable lithium and cobalt is and its only 2 kg lithium is open cast mine not underground coal mining
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,jusb1066 your car uses 10000 kg of crude oil source please
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,jusb1066 with all due respect to the legendary christopher hitchens that which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,johnnyquattro well ask yourself how long does a car engine last how much petrol does it burn in its lifetime and then do the math that is the answer for you are you an adult who can add
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,good test honest and experiencing what many face with battery cars the issues with charge points you can imagine being the same in all rural areas its good to see you enjoying creature comforts of a new car there is a place but as an option not a replacement to petrol and diesel
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,question 1 pedal driving when do the brake lights light
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,cant speak for the fiat but on a zoe the brake lights come on when youre getting regenerative braking similar to what youd get by lightly pressing the brakes otoh the zoe wont come to a complete halt on regen braking
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,light regen doesnt seem to trigger them only when it gets stronger so like easing off in a conventional car versus actually braking
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,so what do you do while you wait to charge
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,on ev all cars were new at one time and evs were around at the beginning like stanley steamers etc like ian i like them for how they drive part of what makes driving a joy is the wide variety of choices ev fiat one day independence chevelle the next in the us recharge is highly dependent on where you live gasoline electric hybrids are the best option for not getting stranded most importantly there seems no escape from the triangle of doom
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i love you channel evs and fiat 500s
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i was thinking not typing it all looks complicated and faffy then i remembered we own a 2018 carwifes daily thats really complicated and faffy luckily i also have a 20 year old van which is simple and squishy my daily thanks for the review its a good insight also it looks like a lovely car peace and love
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,is the charger infrastructure any better i remember you jaguar epace trip
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,that engine bay looks like it was designed for a petrol engine to me
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,this is what electric cars should be like physics and the paranoia for range have lead to a whole lot of oversized evs small evs make the most sense to me i am also not a fan of silly looking evs either why should you have to look likely a gumby to drive an ev
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,a lovely little car ian it would baffle me with all its technology but very nice
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,totally freaked that the rod stewart song the radio started playing 439 is the one my partner was listening to at the same time they were just a few seconds off sync back to the rest of the video
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,does the one pedal driving apply the brake lights when slowing
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i love my electric car and have now owned two vw id3 models first one is now in west wales and my current one sports a cx plate as i bought it in wrexham the problem with electric cars is the woeful charging network good luck finding a working fast charger when travelling away from home regarding ride the 58kw id3 is fantastic my long range 77kw model not nearly as good the bmw i3 which we run at work has a terrible choppy ride and is best avoided as regards the seamless power from a standing start it is such a revelation the anti electric car brigade i guarantee have never driven one
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,ive just covered 340 miles in two days and not one faulty charger did get charger blocked once though
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,great review as always ian co but all a lot of faffing about messing around with cables every night in the winter when you get home after 13 hours at workrange anxiety waiting for charging pointsspiralling electricity costs lot better off with a few grands worth off proper fiat 500 or panda 12 fire engine dead easy to servicenot contest for me
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,i literally pull into my driveway pick up the charger wand on the wall and plug it in it takes less than 10 seconds wake up every morning with my car 80 full a range of 200 miles and it heats itself up for me before i leave my sofa
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,davidp7414 couldnt do the nc500 like ive done 1664 miles with a milk float mate dont care what anyone says
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,great video excellent review of the future i am also impressed how youve managed to spawn your own police force of contributors who launch preemptive strikes against anyone who is going to say anything negative about evs just to annoy goad that crew ill say this in the spirit of summing up what i think evs are great as a concept and in practice for many motorists they are likely to be the way to get about independently in the future in reality its another step in the direction of cars becoming sterile containers charging is not great on the public network and is now the equivalent of 130 a litre on my local council network so they are not going to be marketed as cheap to either buy or even to run the idea of considering how to dress while in the car because you dont want to put the heating on is frankly bonkers i regard wearing a coat and thick socks while driving as a bit odd if they charged much more quickly 10 mins from min to max and there were a lot more charge points i dont think there would be anywhere near as much negativity its the future and will be the way to get about but an ev is not something we will be likely to take out for a run to soak up the atmosphere i think thats what upsets some its the end of motoring as a fun thing with character
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,thing is ill never stop loving my character cars but i love the experience of driving electric
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,hubnut agreed although how much of the ev thing is novelty toy value time will only tell i think as a means of getting about id pick an ev 99 times out of 100 they are so easy to drive and they have a smugfaceinducing quality about them must ignore the alleged fun of planning how to loiter in a supermarket to get some extra charge in but to go for a drive in an ev it would be like going on holiday in a utility room once youve exhausted the thrill of repeating the fastest ever 040mph
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,johnlladron735 a bit facetious of me perhaps but have you ever driven a modern econobox not much to be excited about in them either if you ask me the drivetrain being ev doesnt make much difference in that case seems to me its rather the modern car part rather than the ev drivetrain thats the culprit of them having no personality
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,goldencroc i agree with you most cars ceased to have personality pretty much 20 years ago i think that evs have just sealed the deal on sterility however please consider what i said about which car id choose for most journeys driving is pretty crap these days and you just want the least hassle in the cheapest operational manner evs do that even better than an econobox there is clear water between fun and modern motoring just wish the ev charged a lot faster because that is rather rubbish
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,johnlladron735 well i am in the lucky spot of sitting pretty with my dream car for fun trips already bought yes really my dream might be a bit unusual dont forsee me selling it ever if i want even more adrenaline i get one of the sportsbikes out of the garage if i wanted an ev commuter i would buy something like an old nissan leaf personally disclaimer this whole post was a bit of a sidenote and not really a reply to anything specific you wrote cheers
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i dont like electric cars
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,nice review ian its nice to see a petrol head that likes evs as i am the same ive a tesla model 3 lr its the best car ive owned bar none apart fromthe model 3 it replaced its an awd 400 bhp 5 seat sport saloon and has realworld range of 300 miles on the motorway for there is nothing like them on the road its done 400 miles today at an average speed of 59 mph at the grand cost of 1460 i charged for 14 minutes the amount of time it took to go to the services restroom and grab a coffee hardly an inconvenience
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i have the model 3 sr and i regularly get 250 miles and its interesting that it appears better on the motorway than in towncountry roads ive done 25000 miles since march and as a result will never go back to a vehicle directly powered by fossil fuel though i dont think our governments removal of all assistance in purchasing an ev is a serious impediment to their wider adoption
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,tesla is a good looking car but can you tell me do the brake lights come on when the throttle is lifted and it slows rather quickly i only ask as one overtook me pulled in front and slowed because of traffic i very nearly ran into the back of it
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,eng9040 yes brake lights come on when slowing down on regen to clarify brake lights dont come on when very gently slowing down with regen much like using engine braking on a manual ice car does not put the brake lights on
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,and it charges in 20 minutes on the supercharger and tells you if there are chargers available before you arrive y owner
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,phonotd depends when you buy if i bought my car today with options it would be 65k mine was 49k
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,garethsaunders1260 and there you have it i couldnt justify 49k never mind the 65k price tag my current vehicle was purchased new 1 year ago for around 28k if i had gone down the hybrid route it would have cost me around another 5k but the maths didnt add up to that being a sensible option and it certainly wouldnt have been any greener
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,davidp7414 where exactly and how plentiful are these super chargers surely common physics dictates that rapid charging of batteries also reduces their service life
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,357 its amazing how you do that female voice i never saw your lips move what a talent
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,theodore roosevelt drove an electric car made by columbia vehicles of connecticut on the 22nd of august 1902 more than 120 years ago wowabout them onions
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,sherpa mode makes it sound like it should transform ala insperctor gadgets car into a leyland sherpa not sure how thatd be an advantage though p
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,did you sort the traction battery alert in the end
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,fiat came from making the most trashy rubbishy cars in the 70s to now producing some of the best cars on the road the fiat 500 is a success because it looks good compared to its sister model ford which didnt sell very well at all because it didnt have the looks also i think the petrol engine has got so complicated and in the attempt to make it environmentally friendly thats gone beyond its usefulness where as the petrol engine will always have a place in history we can all be proud of but the electric is the future
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i found the interior of the old 500 too narrow theres no elbow room next to the door i expected this to be better but its not
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i own 3 cars with a combined age of 106 years 2 that suit the daily needs of my family and a third for limited use fun if i am forced to replace my station wagon with an electric vehicle what are my choices and how long will it last
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,actually really interesting to hear your experiences out in the wilds as although not relevant 99 of the time to 99 of the people being on holiday in a place like ceredigion for 1 of our time and what happens with charging is a large part of many peoples anxieties about buying an ev
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,aberystwyth finally has quite a few chargers about time further south is still a proper challenge though
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,ive never had an issue finding charging for my 500e no one should be put off buying an ev as most people do no more than 20 miles a day and home charging should see to that easily
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,my town in ireland has many public car parks and roadside parking bays have them along with two local supermarket car parks they are provided by the electricity supply network company esb debit or credit card payment own cables required and most are 75 kwh a few rapid charge but increasing in numbers slowly
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,look folks were all just going to have to get used to electric cars one day so suck it up buttercup 😊
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,ill have to watch this just to give it a fair try i have to say though ive never ever liked the 500 such an ugly awkward looking car to me i always preferred the panda hahaha
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,agree stephen and i wonder if the muck on the fiat was caused by a covert test drive by matt at furious driving
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,does the lack of really using the brakes as much have a noticable effect or is it hilly enough for you not to notice a difference
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,it stops strongly using regen i barely touch the brake pedal though the car will brake for you in one pedal mode
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,hubnut remember you need to use the brake pedal sometimes to stop the calipers from seizing if not used
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,the car operates the brakes itself and even hill holds im sure the calipers will be fine
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i really like the fiat 500 but the lack of rear doors makes me want to wait for the fiat panda which hopefully comes out fairly soon
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,another great review ian nice to see you have the occasional foray into new vehicles puts the older ones into context nicely i have a very new car and two much older cars the best combo imho 500 looks like the perfect second car for local mileage
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,please dont make your reviews about whats in the touch screen like doug demuros done
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,splendid review 🙂
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i never realised the cost to charge it was included with onto have to say i really like the inside of the 500 reminds me of fiats of old especially those little touches of the map of turin and the old 500 a excellent and balanced review of what you like and do not like
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,its not a family car but its a great city car i am very much looking forward to the abarth
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,as long as the abarth doesnt have artificial pops and bangs from a pretend exhaust waking everyone up every morning then thats ok that would be an immense improvement over the petrol
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,mattbrownbill it does have a pretend engine note but no pops and bangs and you can switch it off and drive in silence
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,one of the things that makes me against silly priced electric cars is the fact they are being rammed down our throats by over paid politicians who can afford themat our expense 😡 in the name of saving the planetwhich we know is all bull shittery
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,do the brake lights come on with regen
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,they do depending on the strength it also applies the hydraulic brakes in one pedal mode
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,there is definitely a place for evs very good for puttering around when you dont have to go far and dont care much about engines etc
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,ive done 25000 miles since march in an ev and i can testify that they are for more than just puttering around
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,most peoples requirements fit well within the range of a modern ev 90 of the time people are always thinking they need 600 miles because thats what they get out of a tank of diesel but thats like wearing a waterproof goose down parka in may through july because you were cold and wet for 3 days in january you just adjust your thinking the charging time is a negative but there are positives to make up for it you shouldnt be doing over 200 miles without a rest anyway really so as long as there are enough chargers about for people to use taking a 1540 minute break every 3 and a bit hours might make the roads safer highway code says 15 minutes every 2 hours of driving the furthest you could go in 2 hours is about 130 ish miles so well under an evs range
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,leatherworkstation agreed evs are probably fine most of the time apart from the cost its the other 10 that is the problem if there was no push to get rid of ice vehicles but to coexist there wouldnt be such a back lash im sure most people would be happy to use an ev if affordable most of the time but if you want to tow something occasionally and for a myriad of other reasons occasionally use an ice vehicle it shouldnt be a mortal sin if it is i suggest we give up jet travel and use electric trains and clipper ships
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,chrisyoung7157 you have summed it up perfectly there is a backlash because people cant afford to buy a new car and are worried about what is going to happen in 2030
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,dave marshall thats on them though isnt it noone has ever said that ice cars in general are going away in 2030 of course they arent theyre just not making new ones if you cant afford a new electric car you cant afford a new petrol car theyre not that far apart and its in the news currently that by 2025 evs are expected to be cheaper to purchase than an ice if you dont like electric cars you dont like new cars most likely so what does it matter if they stop making new ice ones youre not going to get one anyway because apart from the engine all modern cars have the same issues that subscribers to this channel dont like also all my life people have being telling me that were eventually going to run out of oil it hasnt happened yet and may not happen ever but that has been a constant background throughout my life youd think everyone would be prepared by now to prepare for other means of propulsion
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,my old renault scenic 06 did that if i was stopped at lights it would shut off the wipers and go again once driving but there was also a knob to change how sensitive the sensor was
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,my every day car among others i own is 29 years old but its good to review these cars as fuel is not going to get cheaper
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,probably a perceived market demand and manual reversion for emergency purposes does seem odd as it all adds weight
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,really interesting and useful review thanks for doing it
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,nope it cycles the various settings intermittent full on max speed
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,does sherpa mode give you the feel of driving a 1970s leyland van
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,very interesting i too like the styling but i dont like that you have to manage the accessories to save power that is a turn off for me
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i like em the charger availability thing reminds me of the early days of cashpoints where can you find ome and is it compatible very familiar the sooner every lamp post is upgraded with a socket the better really years ago i joked that evs might give birth to a market of downloadable car tones so you can give it engine noises of your choice
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,absolutely brilliant video ian miss hubnut it really is a lovely car brilliantly filmed guys
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,good stuff lots of info i love the technology but still not sure i would want an ev yet
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,what a couple of stars given car to review by company goes christmas shopping you two are the best big thumbs up for the review as always
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,that nice little space should be a wireless phone charger it is in ours
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,im also of a similar mindset where i like evs a lot as well as classics i just recently found out that fiat will retail the 500e in 2024 i would love one now
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,we had one of the first primas in the country owned it for about 18 months my wife loves it i still have my 2017 passat dinosaur burner for work but in town this thing is my first choice over the vw weve done longer trips in it id say we get 120 miles on a run about 140 around town i get the naysayers but they are usually people that havent spent any real time with an ev it goes like stink from the lights im 6ft 2 and 20 stone and fit fine but the go pedal makes my foot ache because of he angle the electronics are not very good they are laggy and keep resetting to kms
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,jusb1066no they haventall the new cars and vans i drive have wipers with minds of there own and headlights witch switch on when going under a treeuseless technology for the sake of it
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i wish they could make this without any gizmos no power steering no ac with manual mirrorswindows etc i like buttons screens are never intuitive
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,they dont make any modern car like it
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,the timing does say it all they only show up to flood the comment section early so they feel like theyve conquered todays battlefield in the great imaginary war against evs the rest of us showed up to watch a video i guess
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,munkenba i could be wrong but i suspect the anti ev sentiment is generated by what people see as a war against ice vehicles if they were left to compete on merit i think there would be no war current narrative is to demonise ice vehicles those who cant afford an ev or just dont see it fitting into their mission requirements understandably get annoyed love an ev myself but dont want it forced on me id like both
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,id only have confidence in owning an electric car if there are many more chargers and super fast ones too
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i think the main issue with electric cars is theres always going to be a shortage of charges because of the sheer amount of time you are connected to one of course you can fill up 20 cars with petrol in the same time
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,jusb1066 come visit germany and see how charging may look in 3 years in the uk thats the time it took us to get from a single 50 kw charger here and there to at least 4 300 kw chargers in most service stations and 2030 up to over 100 at highly frequented places thats not including tesla superchargers
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,germany is running out of energy what do you think is going to power all those chargers
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,jusb1066 germany has an even worse energy situation than the uk solar doesnt produce much power in winter and needs 100 backup the natural gas situation is a disaster german companies are shuttering and offshoring due to the cost of electricity politicians have made very shortsighted decisions and the consequences are now being felt
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,wibblywobbly1234 everywhere was relying on russian gas exactly why we should have gone to renewables many years ago certainly not a reason to be clinging on to them electricity maybe short but it exists cant say the same for relying on other countries
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,jusb1066 uk was 3 russian gas germany was 60 there is no replacement ready at any price renewables make the electricity grid unstable above around 20 of supply germany should have invested in nuclear 20 years ago foolish decisions made now you are completely screwed shortages and blackouts coming wake up
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,btw are you aware that the production of 6 litres of fuel already needs about 810 kwh of electricity which alone will bring an electric car over 50 km even before the electric equivalent of these 6 litres is being used so if you are asking for the least energy consumption you sure as hell want to go evs
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,garage6346 the german government has just announced a 200b energy subsidy for german consumers and businesses the bill will have to be paid somehow the uk is not much better marginal electricity cost is touching 1200 per mwh insanity in all directions the problem could be solved by dropping the trade embargo with russia and cancelling the push for net zero unfortunately politicians would rather see us freeze and starve than admit they were wrong
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,garage6346 1kwh of electricity takes an ev about 3miles 5km
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,wibblywobbly1234 now you are talking about prices a shortage would have been something like the uk had a while ago that affected fuel btw not electricity if i may remind you regarding ev mileage my ioniq consumes about 17 kwh100 km in winter at german autobahn speeds 14 in summer and under 12 with everyday b road usage my wifes e208 and my fathers id3 are about 2 kwh100 km higher but yes of course theres bella vs betty in the ev world too
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,garage6346 theres never a shortage in a free market politicians are not allowing the free market to operate they are deciding which fuels we should use they are fixing prices and they are using subsidies the inevitable outcome will be shortages
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i dont understand the hate people have for electric cars hubnut is about various things but one of the most important as jayemm once testified is being open to different views and tastes and another is ians delivery which we all enjoy otherwise we wouldnt watch hubnut if he were to talk about sewing machines in a video id watch it because this is hubnut and i suspect many would too but an actual car just with a different means of propulsion and some petrolheads are getting their knickers in a twist grow up
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,its the buying price and range i dont like and also no use to those of us living in flats
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,we cant charge at home either it isnt the end of the world though it would be more convenient to be able to
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,same could be said about some ev detractorsnot aiming that at you but some haters hate far too much
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i am grown up no issue with evs only the hazardous safety and environmental battery technology employed its going to be diesel gate 2 and worse in 15 years time when there is no commercial market for lithium or cobalt millions of these batteries are being produced and no end of life statutory requirement on the manufacturer to take responsibility its an absolute ticking environmental time bomb and an inconvenient truth go research it yourself rather than take my word
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,the hate is justified until car companies start making affordable evs with the equivalent range of an ice
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,tylerhornby2619 do you know what else was expensive and compromised when they were relatively new petrol cars
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,part of the problem is that there isnt enough lithium known on the planet to replace ice vehicles for gb alone let alone the world forget all the other places lithium batteries are needed phones renewables back up then there is the problem of zero resale value when the battery starts failing then the fact the batteries cant be recycled and will go into landfill to leach out many many more problems just scratching the surface i love hubnuts videos no matter what car but we can give our opinions nonetheless
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,fugawiaus and at the end you will have to pay to get it taken away for scrapping not good for those of us who drive yokes nearing the end of their lives cos it is all we can afford 😭
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,tom mullins modern evs are about 12 years old the main battery chemistry has already changed numerous times and will continue to do so so there may be less material issues in the future a lot of your post about values etc seems to be based on the incorrect belief that batteries in evs fail quickly they dont first gen nissan leafs are still driving about on their og battery and they didnt even have active cooling to protect the battery modern battery management looks after them much better and theyll last for donkeys years definitely well over 100k miles there are teslas over 300000miles and nissan say their batteries will last 500k before failing and any battery issues arent normally total replacement jobs the batteries are made up of individual cells so you can replace the ones that are reporting issues for much less by 100k miles plus1015 years in what value are you expecting to have in the car if ive got a 14 year old petrol suv and a 14 year old ev suv both bought for around 40k im going to accept that im not going to get my money back
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,hubnut i think the hate comes from the fear ice cars will become illegal if they were allowed to continue to compete with evs i suspect the hate would evaporate
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,way too expensive for what it is too many compromises ok as a second or third car but thats all
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,richard howlett average weekly mileage in the uk is 142 miles a week most people could run one happily with one charge every 710 days at a rapid charger price is predicted to be cheaper than ice by 2025 apparently too though that is the major issue as it stands
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,leatherworkstation a couple of weeks ago i was at the classic car show at the nec i live in bury i drove there and back without any concern summer 2021 i drove to an event in the new forest and returned that day one of my favourite places to visit is the mull of galloway do i need to go on
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,richard howlett nothing stopping you doing that in an ev you might not even have to stop and charge depending on which one youve got only place i know in bury is gigg lane so i did gigg lane to the nec and its 109 miles planning a 20 minute stop to top up your battery isnt concerning to me i dont know why it would be to anyone sure its not a fantastic thing and by no means a benefit of ev ownership but its not concerning
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,leatherworkstation mate you can change the chemistry and get slight changes in current battery tech till the cows come home your changing 140 miles to 145 miles it doesnt change the fact there isnt enough lithium known to supply the volumes the batteries cost 3x the cost of manufacture to recycle so they go to landfill to leach into the water table most of the parts on the ev are composite to keep down weight and arent recyclable it costs 10000 to 30000 to replace a battery in an ev meaning it has zero resale value there are cars still being used at over 120yrs old they are classics and have style form and function evs are generic and at times difficult to tell apart they will not be kept they are purely function nobodys interested buying a second hand car knowing they will have to spend tens of thousands of dollars on it its disposable look at your toasters tvs etc they used to last then you got it repaired now they are disposable you dont get them fixed this is the direction of evs the batteries are made in china good luck a vast amount have been replaced under warranty more have failed waaaay early that 30000 price tag isnt for replacing cells because its cheaper to replace the whole pack than strip it down to replace individual parts they wont be repaired they are disposable you dont get your phone battery repaired you toss the phone at the end of the day these only make sense as a small inner city runabout for mum as the family second car outside that they are useless ps those old evs rare as hens teeth
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,alexander most of the hate is from being trounced at the traffic light grand prix by even the most mundane of evs the price point not being part of the club and then youll get made up nonsense about issues the person never before had an interest in that they half remembered from a daily mail article thats part based in fact from 2016 but mostly just lies theres plenty of examples above of pure nonsense but it mainly comes down to the price of admission what do children do when they cant have something well anyone who is a parent knows theres plenty of valid criticism of evs most of which applies in spades to ice and that which doesnt well that tends to be brand and infrastructure specific 31 years of ice ownership classic and modern and counting for me coming to an end as soon as oh and the battery wall we have repurposed ex ev pack the only thing that needs to go to landfill is the bs people come up with about something they are envious of
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,davidspencer7254 you might have a point about being excluded from the club because of the price however i think its worse than that because the narrative is not only you wont be allowed in the club eventually we will take your ice vehicle off you or tax it out of existence leaving you nowhere unless we are prepared to give up airline travel i think we should stop treating ice vehicles and their owners as expendable i suggest they be allowed to coexist and if evs become clearly superior thats what people will buy
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,davidspencer7254 most evs dont go blowing anybody away at the lights most are in the 610 sec0100 the others cant afford to do that often range anxiety of course 100 is about it for an ev my v8 keeps pulling to its speed limited 265kph meanwhile that sound oh and i can actually load my car and tow something evs not so much but everything you wrote is explained in your last paragraph the salesmen saw you coming from a mile off when an ev battery is dead or dying it cant be reused the chemical reaction has stopped ceased it cannot be reused you cant take a dead battery and put it in your house its still dead theres a sucker born every minute
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,fugawiaus yes of course you will be driving at 100mph at the lights silly boy if you cant afford a fast ev you cant afford a fast ice i quote fast because well lets face it they arent fast are they not in reality a few outliers are fast but the bell curve of ice vehicles are way slower than the bell curve of evs as for range anxiety it would take a vast amount of blasting off your v8 tractor to turn that into range anxiety you seem stuck in the 20132018 nissan leaf era with your comments everything is explained by your last paragraph an ev battery is not just one battery its a vast array of cells with a bms when its not fit for cycling in an ev due to the number of dead or dying cells going below a certain soh its perfectly usable for a home battery please do at least the minimum of research before posting unless you want to look ignorant in which case mission achieved
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,fugawiaus there isnt enough lithium known on the planet where did you get this factoid lithium is a very common element then there is the problem of zero resale value when the battery starts failing define starts failing do you mean battery capacity then the fact the batteries cant be recycled they can be recycled a nissan leafs battery pack can be refurbished using 90odd percent of the original material youre talking bollocks
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,tylerhornby2619 define range on an ic on one tank how often do you drive brim to fumes whats your commute 20 miles re price does that mean you hate ferraris too and rolls royces what about gas and electricity ultimately any new car is expensive by hubnut standards but eventually grandpa hubnut will be travelling to the outer hebrides to collect a 300 electric fiat 500 that will breakdown somewhere around glasgow
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,chrisyoung7157 isnt that a self fulfilling prophecy though if the majority of people move to evs then theres no need to force people off ics i can still drive my traction engine on the highway although that would probably change if everyone did that
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,benholroyd5221 the intention of many governments to ban the sale of new ice vehicles in 2030 suggests there is every intention to force people off them i think much of the angst would go away if people were allowed to buy what suits their requirements and or bank balance if evs are an acceptable price do what people require of them they wont need protection
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,davidspencer7254 i didnt say mph where i live you can you replace a battery because its dead or dying the chemical reaction will cease the original battery is replaced because all the cells are almost used up they dont last forever they are on their last legs again there is a sucker born every minute ps im an electrician
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,chrisyoung7157 banning sales is different to making them illegal though if bank balance is an issue youve still got another decade plus of second hand cars i do share the concern somewhat but it depends how the market pans out but ultimately i dont think thats where the hate is coming from anyway
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,benholroyd5221 as you say time will tell i guess im pessimistic and evs will come up against some insurmountable problems that will disenfranchise half the population if the current thinking remains dont get me wrong id like an ev myself not exclusively tho current prices i wont be getting one and would be very reluctant to buy an old one when the batteries are prohibitively expensive to replace
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,tom mullins old evs are rare because they didnt sell many not because theyre broken once you take the ones that people binned into a tree or whatever there really shouldnt be a lot of imievs about for example i see plenty of gen 1 leafs on my travels though youve misunderstood my battery chemistry point though its not just about making the batteries go further thats not the drive for chemistry changes its material and weight new chemistries have already significantly reduced cobalt usage there are lithium free batteries being made that are comparable to lithium ones for static usage which can bring down overall lithium usage should evs not move away from it and really its new technology were living through it in the 90s any rechargeable battery was nicad noone thought anything of it it was just what you got if you wanted a rechargeable anything and then they just got replaced by something better that might happen with liion but we cant see into the future you need to take off your rose tinted spectacles i think all cars are generic especially modern ones and anything since i dont know the 90s there are a few that are special but then there are a few evs that are special too if youre not close minded badge engineering and focus groups killed most originality and quirkiness in motoring long before the ev came along
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,leatherworkstation im an electrician evs are definitely not the future cells have a life they can only hold a charge and be charged so many times chemistry 101 if one cell is failing then the others will fail soon as well except if one is faulty evs have been around since the early 1900s they failed back then no one wanted them they reappeared in the 50s and 60s again fail they have been tried and failed until recently governments threatening mandating them has forced them into the market the first nissan leafs were rubbish and not worth replacing the batteries the new ones arent much better as soon as something is forced on society it will inevitably end badly you cannot build billions of evs build massive battery farms to back up renewables build billions of disposable phones car batteries campingemergency batteries for the entire planet there is simply not enough lithium the whole climate rubbish is starting to crash and burn and it will take out the ev utopia with it
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,benholroyd5221 id love an electric dont get me wrong i could afford one but the amount of miles i do doesnt warrant the upfront cost but at work i do sometimes 300 miles a day i dont think thats possible without recharging
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,tom mullins climate rubbish starting to crash and burn as countries say no to fossil fuels en masse including china and invest in renewables dont know what reality you live in but it isnt the same as the rest of us you being an electrician isnt really relevant unless youre a battery technician and even then i wouldnt say knowledge of material mining and scarcity is relevant to battery production linemaintenance electricians im an aerospace engineer but ive not got a clue how much titanium or aluminium there is in the ground even if there isnt enough probably isnt on earth you dont need it for every battery you need it at the moment for cars but battery farms dont need it for a start sodium ion or bromide batteries are suitable for that as are various other old hat chemistries and things like that welsh water battery where they pump during the day and let it run through a generator at night you dont need lithium for a lot applications just light weight and portable ones
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,leatherworkstation talk about living in a delusion china has officially pulled out of all agreements on climate they are currently building about one coal plant per month india is building them philippines is building them the only renewables china makes is for export to idiots that dont understand how they workor dont work oh being an electrician is not relevant to batteries you are kidding arent you are you serious aerospace engineer do you even know how electricity works my son is also an electrician working in kalgoorlie in western australia he works with one of the largest mine specific electrical companies in the world keep getting your info from facebook and twitter your not qualified to talk on this subject
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,exellent but ian i aint rich enough cannot justify ev buying my most expensive car as im hub nut 4500 as 99 off time car is sitting outside house cannot justify spending a fortune on newish buy cheap drive around 5000 a year three cars at moment 3000 nissan qashqie 55000 miles 2010 first ones better than newer renault at least i spend more thsn my limit around my passing off driving test in 1984 was 500 at moment nissan streached me from my normal at present days 1500 per car money fore family not cars only ive only had three breakdowns since i passed my test in 1984 cars were hillman imp morris marina cortina mk3cavalir mk1datsun violet datsun 140jcarolla earky one renault 25 nissan bluebird x2 skoda esttle2x hyundi atoz granada mk3 etc exellent huuuubbbbnnnutttteeerrriiiissshhhhnnnneeesssssneil
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,tom mullins china dont like being told what to do thats why they dont sign up to international agreements but theyre using more renewables than they ever have 30 plus this year they just use coal for majority of the rest thats the issue in europe we use coal as the last resort i do know how electricity works yeah but my point was unless youre an electrician who is also a battery technician and a lithium scarcity and mining expert its not really relevant because others who are those things say differently people just put their occupation or training in to win arguments on the internet but well done for taking it in the worst way possible twitter is a cesspit and facebook is for old people so im alright thanks i normally search for scientific papers and reuters stuff
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,fugawiaus this comment is complete nonsense from beginning to endevery word there isnt even one tiny bit of actual truth contained herein youve completely embarrassed yourself with your mindless ignorant stupidity and thats being complementary and think on this in eight years time you wont be able to buy a new ice car in the uk so youd better get your brain around some actual facts or you could start catching the bus
2022-12-01,YouTube Comment,andymccabe6712 keep putting your fingers in your ears screaming lalala and burying your head in the sand your utopian idealism is just around the corner twitter and facebook say so
2022-12-01,YouTube Comment,dont like the word petrol head it makes me think of clarkson i have no problems with electric cars but for most in flats and street parking they are not economic to charge up 22 quid to charge a 60kwh car plus the charges for sitting in that space
2022-12-01,YouTube Comment,price range charging infrastructure apart from if battery powered cars are so good why does the government need to ban ice car manufacture in 2030 surely battery cars being so good everyone would want one so automatically making ice car not worth the while manufacturing
2022-12-01,YouTube Comment,torresalex except that the battery powered car is pretty much as old as the petrol car like no need to reinvent the wheel
2022-12-01,YouTube Comment,barriewilliams4526 battery are as old as petrol cars but you cannot compare one to other in terms of investment and development do you know what else had crap prices and infastructure when they started out petrol cars
2022-12-01,YouTube Comment,fugawiaus 95 of a lithium battery car phone aa button cells not cost effective atm but should still not be put in the bin can be recycled into new ones so are not thrown away especially as its a valuable commodity even the metal casings can get recycled as old pc boards are once they do reach 70 of original charge capacity they can be replaced leafs can even get upgraded to later model batteries subsidiary of nissan repurposes used batteries into domestic power wall sets
2022-12-02,YouTube Comment,i totally agree both about hubnut and cars a car is a car and electric cars are no worse or better on average than petrol ones they do have some big plusses though if you care about the environment id still love to run a classic though
2022-12-02,YouTube Comment,chrisrichardson774 yes there are some hurdles that need to be sorted out price will get more attractive naturally with scale and technology we would have been looking at parity in prices around now if there hadnt been so much disruption in the world range is not an issue with newer cars though they are much more expensive and so your point on prices will stand for longer than if you only needed a short range car for your last point i reckon some serious legislation is required you would need your own dedicated parking space with charger but this sounds like more expense i dont live in london but i believe they have on street charging i dont know how it works but i cant imagine you can leave your car on a charger from the moment you get home until the next morning this would upset others wanting to use it i dont know what the answer is perhaps special council charge cards to get charged at a public charger at home rates this solves the cost but not the convenience chargers at the workplace could help i have friends who can charge at work for free im sure some clever people out there will come up with the answer lets hope so anyway
2022-12-02,YouTube Comment,royblackburn1163 you are right the truth is not hate but that doesnt mean that hate is the truth many people who are anti ev are being so from a point of ignorance and they keep rolling out the same old debunked myths there are plenty of reasons to be sceptical about evs but their cleanliness compared to ice cars and their validity as enjoyable cars are not among them it is when these false arguments are levelled against the ev that i sadly and ashamedly get angry
2022-12-03,YouTube Comment,fugawiaus the batteries are in many cases being repurposed to store electricity for the national grid not used for landfill and there are plenty of evs are still on their original batteries stop regurgitating nonsense propagated by the big oil companies in cahoots with msm
2022-12-03,YouTube Comment,briandamaged323 both the msm and fossil fuel are some of the largest investors in renewables you dont seem to know much did you get that rubbish from twitter or face book opinion pieces written by an unqualified reporter none of you have the simple understanding of how batteries work or how putting second hand batteries in with new ones will make the overall battery system unstable and ultimately bound for failure you never mix old batteries with new ones you shouldnt even do that in a torch with d cell batteries but of course you are all the experts twitter and facebook say so
2022-12-04,YouTube Comment,briandamaged323 no i got that off the prospectus and websites of the large renewables companies its called research you should learn it sometime rather than get your scientific knowledge from trusted science publications like facebook and twitter i maybe a dinosaur but at least im not a naive useful idiot
2022-12-09,YouTube Comment,electric cars are neither bad nor good they are simply hated when they are an imposition by authorities that prevent us from driving freely and choosing what type of car we want or can have
2022-12-09,YouTube Comment,carlosmartinezyq1gm slippery slope you let people drive what they want and they are selfish and irresponsible on the other hand impose what they can drive and you end up with trabants its a matter of balance the middle ground people should be sensible but many times are not
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,royblackburn1163 you make some good points but also get some thing wrong your reasons for not going for an electric car yet are all valid that you have to charge them with dirty electricity is completely false i dont im on a clean tariff and have solar nuclear power i grudgingly admit that we probably need it like we need to mine for minerals to make our cars and like we need to devote resources to grow ourselves food lets look at each case and try and improve how we do things rather than throw in the towel and keep polluting ourselves to oblivion
2022-12-13,YouTube Comment,royblackburn1163 im not sure how renewables can be thought unreliable the sun seems to come up every day and the wind is always blowing somewhere i think i know what you mean though you cant produce solar during the night and occasionally the wind might drop even in the north sea this is where storage will come in we have a plan it isnt all in place yet but it can and will work im confident of it this problem that putin is causing is a temporary spanner in the works i can see some knee jerk reactions happening such as renewed calls for fracking but wish the powers that be could understand that if they spent the same money on renewables and the systems to make them work we could not only get these problems solved more quickly than any other method could but it would also be sustainable best regards tim
2022-12-13,YouTube Comment,royblackburn1163 i think your first point is answered or will be by storage you make a good point but i believe the answer is there we are totally in agreement on nuclear and fracking it seems i reckon youre doing your bit with the car and bike im an exbut itching to be again biker and so im bound to ask what bike you have i would love a zero or something similar but alas circumstances make it out of the question for the moment your landy sounds awesome you should not feel and it seems you dont guilt for keeping a classic i would argue against it being as green as an ev simply because you still have to burn fossil fuel to go anywhere but lovely old cars like this have a place as long as mass transport gets cleaner i hope we can justify keeping and running classics of course a mitsubishi evo just as an extreme example to make a point is a future classic perhaps biofuels can make these oldies even more guilt free i have heard that companies porsche for one are working on synthetic fuels so there may be other options i am optimistic for the future i can see a day when we can squander as much energy as we can think of ways of doing so and it will be sustainable this will give us the best of all worlds all the best tim
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i worked out i couldnt rely on itev in an urban area without a drive or home charging due to expense and hassle that was before tesco and i expect others soonstopped free chargingthe amount of phev and frikken teslas taking up free charging bays and other public ones was nuts and imo selfishi drive a petrol abarthwhich i love at the moment so was a prime customer for a 500e but instead have got a 2002 stepwgn with a honda k for some camping your hubnut camping vids may have influenced me a little 😀
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,its overpriced per month for that can someone explain why anyone would pay that monthly
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,because it includes insurancepublic charging and servicing cost and its not a finance deal its a subscription service so you can change to different cars and your not locked in like car finance if your financial situation changes
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,well call avis and compare the rates can anyone quote the all inclusive monthly cost of their own new car i doubt it if they did they would probably have a cardiac
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,jamescaley9942 ive got a 2021 focus st line x and my monthly cost of insurance tax and finance is 350 so cant get my head around paying nearly 600 a month for that thing on another note its limited on what charging stations you can use oh and i get 4 years servicing included not selling it to me
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,very good question its absolutely crazy money and on limited mileage i have no answer
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,started watching halogen on a modern electric car power wasting should be 100 led
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,those electric cars are waste incarnate everything is too heavy and theyre full of useless and heavy bells whistles
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,richierich1245 anything helps the light is so much brighter and the cost of the car this is a small but necessary addition plus halogen headlights seem so 1990s
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,datasilouk1995im finding most modern car lights too bright especially in the rain i thought there were limits for such things
2022-11-30,YouTube Comment,mattbrownbill yes i agree a couple of evenings a week i do a 20 mile journey on a switchback main road and am constantly dazzeled by vehicles wth these bright white head lamps as we meet on the dips and rises night time driving is no pleasure at all
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,just a friendly note nuova new in italian f is pronounced norva not nuover in italian ie norva fiat 500
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,retiredbore378 given that i come from an italian family have lived in italy and was not promulgating the actual phonetics of the word but approximating the actual pronunciation for a british english speaker using nor as in norwood and va as in van 1st syllable gets one much closer to a correct pronunciation than using a mutant bastardization of the spanish word for new nueva have a nice evening and please dont fall dont the stairs tonight after you trip on your own smugness 😘😘
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,retiredbore378 not at all old boy i have a workout to complete this evening and little pep in my step does not hurt all i have long made peace that many older people are still alive because neither god nor the devil can stomach their arrival so put off the date to the very last minute
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,retired bore indeed even the alphabet can vary from the standard 21 letters
2022-11-29,YouTube Comment,howardlevert really please enlighten me using actual examples what you have written sounds like the ravings of a glue sniffing troglodyte
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,im just not a lover of evs call me old fashioned but i be the last man standing to give up my petrol car

2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,i wont have an ev any time will continue to drive my 15 year old mazda
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,im sure there are people with steam cars complaining about it 100 years ago
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,robtt997 i guess you dont live near any city then
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,jusb1066 why would that be relevant
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,robtt997 im driving my 20 year old clio
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,mancavehobbies6213 may well come sooner than you think the average age of cars in uk is ten years old as they will stop making new ice cars from 2030 onwards then i would imagine by 2050 most new ice cars will have been scrapped then there will be no demand for petrol and diesel plus the gvt will probs keep increasing the tax to a great deal more so thats around 28 years from now so unless youre 80 years old then it will likely happen in your lifetime
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,robtt997 its as relevant as clinging on to internal combustion now something far more efficient now exists a few old people stuck in their ways are not relevant
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,blackmamba12345 diesel will not go anywhere until there is a working alternative to diesel lorries for goods transport electrics work fine for city but for long haul not so much batteries eat into the max gvw too much and range is very limited
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,jusb1066 ev is heavy so not great steering and just dull i drive on country roads where a petrol car is just a superior steer use of child labour getting materials to make battery also upsets me
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,brorappelsin just you wait youll see the gvt will start increasing tax a lot more on diesel you think its expensive now would you be willing to pay say 10 or more per litre they could easily do that then you would literally be priced off the roads and hgvs are now looking at alternative fuels such as electric trucks so i think youll find the days of diesel are limited and electric car ranges are going up by the year for example many tesla can do over 300 miles and even the more affordable corsa e or peugeot 208 e can do up to 250 miles youre living in the past
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,robtt997 children dont work in opencast lithium mines they are unable to reach the pedal of the 250 tonne trucks children however are killed en mass in war zones for the oil
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,blackmamba12345 ill pay whetever it costs provided that my salary increases 😁 again i wasnt talking about cars or their ranges at all ive got a passat ecofuel petrolcng and a diesel octavia so im aware of the alternatives i do want to get an electric car when i can afford one with the rqnge i need as my commute is 77km each way and we do have real winter over here in finland so its pretty cold for half of the year peugeot 208 was quite tempting but sadly still out of my price range
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,blackmamba12345 i be 86 by then if i live that long like i said wont happen in my life time
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,mancavehobbies6213 ah well youll have to revert to your mobility scooter least thats electric lol
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,oh no its electric 😢
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,whats the matter if its electric
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,what happens if you get a power cut
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,nigelrudd670 you cant recharge an ev nor can you fill up a petrol car because pumps need electricity to run so youd be stuffed too you muppet
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,nigelrudd670 in the event of a power cut you cant get petrol either because theres nothing to pump it however my house produces over 10 kw of electricity from solar panels
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,nigelrudd670 you keep going bevause the likihood of you being out of juice when the power cut is on is highly unlikely and power cuts only last for a few hours at most
2022-11-28,YouTube Comment,madm4tty been looking at the ev6 iconic stuff ahhaa
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,jonny is honestly one of the few that has gone from traditional media to social media and is really good at it may it be reviews like this one indepth geeky videos updates on his personal fleet or anything involving richard porter its always enjoyable
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i have pinned this not because i necessarily believe it to be true but in the hope that a brand will see the light and sponsor the channel thanks
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow i cant believe you dont have a sponsor yet are people mental this channel will be going places with its amazing and very well shot content you were born to do this jonny with you calm yet very witty and knowledgable style
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow i really hope that happens for you and most importantly you get to retain creative control
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i agree the thing that really makes the channel watchable for me is that jonny hasnt put him self in any of the more traditional motoring tribes hes not ev or nothing and hes not grrr petrol i know if i click on a lake brake show video it will be a well researched to the point that he isnt afraid to read from a little notebook well thought out and very nicely filmed his passion for all things car related comes across in every video without having to be in your face shouty
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,well said hes taken on board helpful constructive criticism and moved the show on professionally im signing up as a paid subscriber i just cant stand the word ptreon even though i just said it
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow love your casual approach and natural presenting style jonny detailed and entertaining hope you find a sponsor that fits with your brand and ethos
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow well it is true jonny and the key is that youre focused on the topics rather than on trying to be a presenter which is what most youtube car folk seem to concentrate on alas you have the advantage of being a naturally excellent presenter of course
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,his mrs is even funniersorry johnny
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,totally in agreement fullychargedshows review is a complete joke compared to this one
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,if we start a petition to get jonny sponsorship and just over half the people who watch this channel sign it they have to debate it in parliament that will get some attention dont you think come on people in fact i will i just started it httpspetitionparliamentukpetitions562716sponsorsnewtokenjv0l0n3xdg1sjywg_du0
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,its a really solid review and a pleasure to watch it leaves the fully charged review of the same car so far behind in the dust no offense meant to robert but their reviews are just not at this level of writing and production thanks for bringing the quality
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,hard to argue with this even when i dont love the car being featured its always interesting
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,paolo bernasconi i wonder if this may help you for context im in australia your experience may be different i no longer use the app to watch yt i use firefox instead i only get one advert at the start of each clip and occasionally one in the middle on the app yt was simply unwatchable and with what i reckon will be the everupward trajectory of jonnys show it will only get worse if my understanding is correct however its important to realise that the number and frequency of adverts is nothing to do with the particular channel youre viewing ie not jonnys fault or within his control
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow you should have more confidence in yourself jonny youre a great presenter and are one of my favourite car people in the last 10 years right up there with harris and needell youve a level of knowledge and professionalism that far exceeds influencers whove largely bought their way into youtube success by having rich daddys who can indulge their expensive habits each to their own but its not something i remotely care about or want to watch i also dont like people who play for the camera which a lot of influencers do youre just far more natural at this ive also enjoyed you bringing your wife into some of the recent videos too its obvious how much you care about her and i bet you troll each other constantly keep up the great work mate
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,action cant be the small battery becuase its going to be so less active
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow epic presented as ever and really nice filming and editing real quality
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow if thats the direction you wish to go you need to stop using the term car pervert it maybe apt but it will leave many corporate types cold but you probably already know that also comparing bobbyllews figures for a much younger channel your figures are looking far healthier
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow a brand called netflix would be excellent

2023-10-25,YouTube Comment,october 2023 fiat 500e club on facebook the high voltages in an ev requires mechanics to have safety training and special equipment may be needed in fact my nearest fiat dealer cant service my la prima because of lack of training and equipment
2023-10-21,YouTube Comment,i like this design more than the one of the minicooper especially the interior
2023-09-11,YouTube Comment,i dont think it compares with a vw eu or a mini or honda e battery cooling range and charging speed are way better
2023-08-11,YouTube Comment,i am a taycan owner and i love this little ev car i think i am gonna buy one 😍
2023-06-01,YouTube Comment,this car can sell on looks alone looks both fantastic and unique hats off to fiat on producing a ground up ev of this size not a cobbled together conversion they just need to get the price down if they want to shift real numbers
2023-05-31,YouTube Comment,im just not sold on evs we are not ready for them
2023-02-18,YouTube Comment,whats the range of the 42kwh at constant 70mph
2022-12-11,YouTube Comment,nice looking car and you made it sound good as a towncity car
2022-11-23,YouTube Comment,i loved the first gen but the range felt so limited even when i got the range up to 111 miles it really lacked excitement knowing i would have to charge it soon i really do hope doubling the range is what the 500 needs but really do hope to see a 500 with 500 miles of range
2022-11-10,YouTube Comment,if they can get 42kw in the fiat then why couldnt honda😮
2022-11-10,YouTube Comment,got a 500e on a subscription i like automatic cars to creep and the fiat only does that in normal my honda e was much more refined loaded and comfortable but 10k more
2022-10-30,YouTube Comment,i really enjoyed this show excellent interesting and entertaining i have been very opposed to evs thinking them a technical and economic blind alley doomed to eventually fail but this car may be different it is making me think hmmmm maybe and it would fit into our lives well my wife and i have a lot of experience of small cars from the fiat group over the years delta hf turbo punto x19 500 and now a panda 4x4 diesel all have been great cars so perhaps our positive prejudice towards small fiats helps me accept this ev the design and styling is fantastic
2022-10-23,YouTube Comment,great review i ordered a 500 the only thing i dort understand is the honda e thing the design study was great the production version is more than disappointing
2022-09-10,YouTube Comment,an informative detailed norazz review thanks
2022-07-15,YouTube Comment,jonny just seen this great review and just to mention you might have felt awkward back then in those clothes but they certainly did not look bad
2022-07-15,YouTube Comment,when i ask my self the fiat man what car do you want in your driveway watching this review first car that comes to mind is the mini and why because it has 170 horsepower if i remember right and would even put a smile on my middle aged depressed face but i love the fiat but also the honda
2022-05-31,YouTube Comment,the previous fiat 500 was launched in 2008and given a facelift in 2015 originally just available as a petrol car then as a hybrid five years later 2013 and an electric only version in 2019
2022-05-21,YouTube Comment,looking at this for my first car its so cuteee
2022-04-29,YouTube Comment,its awesome car if you spend 95 percent of your time in a city i actually love how it looks best looking 500 so far i love modern touches ui graphics are nice lovely design details inside out and long range may be actually useful
2022-04-23,YouTube Comment,the 500e in california is a compliance car frank stephenson designer extraordinaire wants a honda e i would lick johnnys pinkey blinders any time 😋
2022-04-18,YouTube Comment,i also reviewed the fiat 500e cabrio in my channel and i have to say i was impressed with how fiat has managed to maintain the classic style whilst being modern at the same time but i also feel like it does come at a price and that too less practicality solutions
2022-02-08,YouTube Comment,does anyone know if the drivers seat goes back anymore im 6ft 4inch will i feel comfortable driving
2022-02-02,YouTube Comment,johnny please try drive a rhd fiat no room for your left foot i honestly dont know how they let it out of the factory its that bad im so disappointed
2022-01-23,YouTube Comment,if your wife still saves feed bags for fabric it could be an affordable car for living in the city
2022-01-21,YouTube Comment,wait till the italian made electrics start foooking up on that lot lets not forget how terribly assembled the italian make a car
2022-01-20,YouTube Comment,i like everything about this car except the price i can never afford one if the government want me to switch then it will have to go down the chinese route small and cheap yes i understand they are heavily subsidised but if i could get one for 10k id go and buy one as it is ill drive a petrol car till i die which is a shame but a situation not of my making
2021-12-24,YouTube Comment,honestly jonny i have watched and compared these small elctric cars and penny for penny i am still unconvinced that giving up my petrol fiesta would be an advantage to going electric and as scotland has reported it will not enforce the only electric vehicles until 2040 thenn what i have should see me out
2021-12-13,YouTube Comment,please stop to compare with honda fiat is a fiat honda is a honda could you please compare with mini se
2021-12-01,YouTube Comment,shame they both ruined the look and made it bigger than the petrol version yet more unnecessary bloat in car sizes
2021-11-30,YouTube Comment,pleased its not being made in poland that should reduce its embedded carbon emissions depending on where the steel is made cleaner electricity in piedmont than poland and the city versions smaller battery will also reduce the carbon content significantly
2021-11-26,YouTube Comment,its beautiful but tbh it looks like a concept car lol anyways am gonna zunk it cause am all the way here in west africa where electricity isnt that great so am kinda curious as to why fiat didnt manufacture the non electric models fuel consumption models
2021-11-23,YouTube Comment,great review love this car going to test drive this model on friday really hope i like it i love my current 500 lounge
2021-10-24,YouTube Comment,lovely car ordered mine la prima in ocean green two month ago and cant wait until i get it
2021-10-12,YouTube Comment,nice looking carbut a 2020 corsa electric with low mileage is 2122k and ive not seen these fiats for less than 24k in the corsa you get extra doors more passenger and boot space slightly longer range considering fiats motto over here is fix it again tomorrow i wouldve thought theyd be more competitive on pricing instead its very much a case of paying more for less
2021-09-16,YouTube Comment,im getting one for a weekend to try how charging will be already driven one for a day its awesome city
2021-09-16,YouTube Comment,the long range version i could live with that range without many issues
2021-09-16,YouTube Comment,the one pedal driving was very weird but not difficult to get used to
2021-08-22,YouTube Comment,i like more the previous design
2021-08-20,YouTube Comment,the honda has a plain horrible design on the outside way too plain and robot like the fiat actually has some real finesse to its design specially run the headlights and the bulges above the wheels
2021-08-10,YouTube Comment,my wife has suggested one of these to replace our leaf i sat in one of these at the late brake show live in kent this weekend my feet genuinely do not fit without pressing both pedals at once also my left foot does not fit on the foot rest without touching the brake pedal our daughter wouldnt fit in the back without removing her legs first not suitable for us but they seem like a great little city car if you fit in it
2021-08-06,YouTube Comment,the cabrio has no competition only the smart has a cabrio but that has a rang of 63mls apart from that there are zero electrical cabrios
2021-07-17,YouTube Comment,possibly my next car
2021-07-14,YouTube Comment,jonny have you now driven the 500e in right hand drive reviewers find that there is knowhere to rest the left foot is the right hand drive conversion a bit of a disappointment
2021-07-12,YouTube Comment,nice looking car too bad not in the states i would replace my imiev with a 500e i like the 500 look great for around town and going to the city enough range to do what i want and with a ccs can charge it back up quickly is the hardtop a hatchback one thing about the imiev it holds a lot when the rear seats are folded flat looks like a fun 2 person car
2021-07-12,YouTube Comment,thanks for this great review i live in the us and fiat pulled out of the states so sad i had leased the 500e in 2017 and enjoyed it immensely but i guess americans love of big cars doomed the previous 500e version especially with its 90 mile range so i ended up with a 2020 hyundai ioniq limited dont get me wrong its super nice and detailed as the limited is the top trim of the all electric version but its really more car than i need i am a single senior thats retired but wanting to stay green and have another electric car fiat pulled out of the us market as sales fell partly because of the range issue but also because fiat never did any changes or upgrades to its model 500e in all the years it was in the united states fiat should have introduced this newer version and gave it a chance in the us market before pulling out totally this review shows all the new design features inside and out plus the top models increased range which is superior to my top trim hyundai ioniq model with some similar features equal to my ioniq the united states need a small car that is an ev for upper lower income and for lower middle income earners and for students young families and 55 seniors who really arent looking for 200 mile range and costing 40k and up that said fiat has designed this great model but as in the uss past cant just sit back and wait for its sales to drop off before making design or feature changes fiat needs to stay current with other evs in the ev market jim san diego ca
2021-07-09,YouTube Comment,i quite like it definitely looks more aggressive than the previous model but retaining its very unique looks i can see why theyre so popular and decent range for a small ev
2021-07-08,YouTube Comment,a review with a calming vibe to it
2021-07-06,YouTube Comment,with all the excessive boot space they need to figure out how to include a spare a big boot doesnt do me any good if ive got a gaping flat in january its wet its snowing and my fake spare is under the car ferchrissakes or if im driving through montana at 200 am and there simple aint no roadside assistance til morning and ivegot a gap in my tire i can change a spare myself at 200 if only theyd let me
2021-06-17,YouTube Comment,nice vid once again jonny but did i miss that vital piece of info the price please could you tell me as an owner of 3 previous fiat 500s have fiat addressed the bloody awful driving position adjustability of the steering wheel will it slide in and out oo er missusand up and down im really loving the e car and i would probably buy one on a pcp but not if that driving position is still crap obw im 6 cheers bud😎
2021-06-12,YouTube Comment,we picked ours up yesterday la prima with the long range battery im amazed how good it is
2021-06-11,YouTube Comment,what about the slow speed sound how does it sound inside and can you tune it down

2021-06-08,YouTube Comment,were swapping our nissan leaf for a fiat hopefully in june its on order well miss the leaf but are looking forward to the extra mileage and the soft top great review
2021-05-30,YouTube Comment,love the review and what a lovely car
2021-05-28,YouTube Comment,1548 me reading about the jimny if it was sold in my coutry it could have the price tag twice or thrice as much as the hilux
2021-05-22,YouTube Comment,115 mile range is all that is needed for city use most days
2021-05-21,YouTube Comment,lets face it that italian is a sexy beast there is something about the overall look of it that is both masculine and feminine at the same time and most importantly there are no bad angles it just looks good from each of the 360 degrees we have available is it a performer is it reliable hello its a fiat so kind of but thats not the point if it were about all about that wed all be on bmw or ducati motorcycles with slicks suited up with steel pads covering our knees at a certain point in life you just want a fun ride that everyone else respects as an adults vehicle and the 500 is exactly that i think theyll be well received if i were in a living situation appropriate for one id have one
2021-05-18,YouTube Comment,so where is the review no mention about any of its attributes comfort handling etc etc you sure mentioned every other e car out there enough more so than actually reviewing this car car looks great but but again where is the review
2021-05-06,YouTube Comment,just had a loner one when my alfa was at service what a great little car the tech is quite good i didnt expect that honestly the screen feels little weird is its not pointing towards toe driver the powertrain feels strong and makes the car move with quite some punch around town it makes interesting ev noises which i like a lot and add the to driving experience in my opinion the normal driving mode is well calibrated and feels like a nice automatic car without applying a lot of regen braking in the other two range friendly modes the regen braking is pretty aggressive and need some getting used to the ride quality isnt the best ok earth but i was expecting way worse form a swb affordable car its not soft but the suspension did absorb bumps and road imperfections pretty nicely the build quality is somewhat inconsistent around the car some party feel well made and high quality and others seem to have been but together by a blind person in the dark for example the stitching is so bad that you dont have to look at is the figure that out it felt cheap but its doesnt really matter in my opinion the radar cruise control does a fantastic job too and its very easy to operate this car makes a lot of sens as a daily commute city car cheers
2021-05-06,YouTube Comment,this car seems very nice but for the price it is up there with the likes of the bmw i3 which is a more premium brand and offers far better space inside the car
2021-04-22,YouTube Comment,thanks for the review youre rightit will draw a crowd that wouldnt have looked at an electric car beforehand i was going to buy another petrol audi before i saw this review i now have a fiat 500e on order
2021-04-19,YouTube Comment,personally from evs i drove most of them suck i like the vw eup though it is a basic car with everything u have and it is quite nice to drive and be in but nobody could beat the bmw i3 imo
2021-04-19,YouTube Comment,hired a fiat 500 a few years back and it was fun to get around the city not great on the motorway too short at high speed for my liking im surprised that tgearbixevs dont have a two speed box like an electric overdrive surely that could increase high speed
2021-04-14,YouTube Comment,sherpa i think of a mountain climber like 4x4 low range mode bullocks now i am dissapointed it would be cool with a climber mode
2021-04-09,YouTube Comment,the little lamb of agnelli happy to see you goes electric
2021-04-07,YouTube Comment,at 1652 why be a 500 guy is better 😉 you know that parking on a sidewalk is not that legal but people will say cmon is a tiny 500 they are forced to park that way we can walk easily yes that would be 50 best ever is the other 50 they wont ever notice it then you see a suv on the sidewalk is it your that bunch of xxap buy a smaller car you idiot people forgive the tiny 500 because is a people car minimal and nice park the suv and the elders will point at you their walking batons trust me
2021-03-27,YouTube Comment,i really hope the usa will get these i will buy the long range cabrio in a heartbeat i was planning on buying a used ev this year but this is apparently the same price after incentives as my budget i would very much prefer the 500e cabrio over the chevy bolti really hope its available soon need a new car after the pandemic😁

2021-03-12,YouTube Comment,you wont sell me on electric the range is rubbish over what was an already fantastically economical car in petrol guise and was cheaper to buy too
2021-03-11,YouTube Comment,lose all the internal tech just give us power windows heat and ac in a car with a 100 mile range at 70 mph and under 10k new our phones will handle the tech that would be a huge success

2021-02-22,YouTube Comment,johnny historically dont italian cars suffer with electronic issues and then they ask samsung to put a battery in the car seems like tempting fate to me 😬

2021-02-03,YouTube Comment,is this a four seater car
2021-02-01,YouTube Comment,not my choice but as you say if the ice version appealed to a market segment this should appeal to them equally i also totally agree that getting people behind the wheel of an ev just one time is what is needed i let everybody drive my chevy bolt because i know how it changes your mind based on my test drive
2021-01-31,YouTube Comment,for so long we have been waiting for the three main bigname small cars to go electric mini fiat and honda and now they are all finally here together what a wonderful sight it is which is best is a question people have been pondering for the combustion versions for decades and no ones come up with a clear answer yet most likely this will continue as well for the electric ones but this continuing competition will help all 3 to rise to superiority and stardom in the end either way
2021-01-29,YouTube Comment,the 200 mile range will sell like hot cookie if proceed at 35k usd
2021-01-28,YouTube Comment,electricmade in italyg wiz great to see they have changed the model for the electric version spec looks impressive and its fantastic that they have two versions water cooled batteries impressive too however i would have more faith in a car built in poland super review jonny
2021-01-16,YouTube Comment,i just want to point out that the former model of the 500 e was available in norway as well it didnt sell very well though for obvious reasons but you can still get them for quite cheap theres a dealership 10 minutes walk from my home and theyve got dozens of them for sale
2021-01-10,YouTube Comment,good start nice styling now lose 10k off the price and you might be in the starting blocks at the current prices theyre just a middle class divertissement
2021-01-08,YouTube Comment,this may not be what you want to hear but i can guess with a high level of confidence that a lot of sponsors will be not be keen on the old car pervert slogannickname if you like and will want it purged from all social media and videos deacriptions etc i personally dont give a monkeys about it as at the end of the day you are superb at what you do and i want to watch everything you produce on your channel but as we know it is not free to make content weekly i do hope someone reaches outs to you you and autogefuhl are the best on youtube to watch thumbs up and a comment for the yt algorythms watching from londres

2021-01-02,YouTube Comment,nice design has personality
2021-01-02,YouTube Comment,i believe that nobody will buy a car with 2 types of autonomy and power a castrated car
2021-01-02,YouTube Comment,this is kinda like the honda e absolutly stunning unfortunately with such a limited range this car has doomed itself because of ignorant developers with their own head up their arse a car like this would be amazing for the smaller countries like denmark but no one will buy it the price will be 27049 for the cheapest model for the danes and no one will pay that amount for a 100 mile range vehichle its outrageous to put this thing on the market
2020-12-31,YouTube Comment,the old version of the fiat 500e was also available in the canadian provinces of british columbia and quebec and ontario as they have had rebates for evs there are a good number of them zipping around in the vancouver area
2020-12-31,YouTube Comment,the price is not 19990 the price is over 30000 buy abarth 500 that is cheaper and have fun

2020-12-30,YouTube Comment,just love jonnys take on things great review keep em coming
2020-12-27,YouTube Comment,its a shame fiat has decided there is no market for their e car in the usa especially since they improved the range im guessing they would have sold more units of the 21 model over here
2020-12-27,YouTube Comment,a real authentic report and presenter i loved the experience just like i was in birmingham and driving the car there i write posts on wwwmecrofoneblog and definitely i am gonna upload the video and the article on the blog
2020-12-26,YouTube Comment,the soft top roof is great especially in the uk where the sun is appreciated as it is not often around for long particularly up north

2020-12-26,YouTube Comment,in the e ranges i think id prefer a cortina 1600e or a jaguar xke not too struck on the toyota carina e
2020-12-26,YouTube Comment,another slow charge car yawn
2020-12-25,YouTube Comment,beautiful production and a lovely car i would have appreciated a few more technical details though for example does the heating system use a heat pump more efficient but also more complex than a resistance element does the electric motordrive unit have any unique features is the final drive ratio numerically high or low this can affect longterm durability your onscreen comparisons were great looking forward to more in the future
2020-12-24,YouTube Comment,this fiat have the look the honda should have had hondas concept car was real cool the final product was as beige as tommy shelbys whiskey induced droppings
2020-12-24,YouTube Comment,a lot of the previous 500 electric in norway so not only available in the us
2020-12-24,YouTube Comment,my bad seems like they bought up leasing fleets and resold them with new car warranty from fiat norway
2020-12-23,YouTube Comment,im really looking forward to an ev panda cross which will likely be based on the same platform as this much as the current and previous pandas are based on the same platform as the 500 to the best of my knowledge
2020-12-22,YouTube Comment,now to wait for bjorn nylands test where he tells us whether the 500e rapidgates gets hot after motorway driving charges slowly or coldgates charges slowly in cold weather spec is one thing realword performance another
2020-12-22,YouTube Comment,like the plastic mounted in indonesia from the australian carbage which were supposed to be recycled i would very much like to see a video where they recycle the sea plastic into car seat fabric to believe it

2020-12-21,YouTube Comment,looks good jonny i like this car with its new aggressive stance apart from the stupid electric hand brake switch thing and no cd player
2020-12-20,YouTube Comment,fca please please please bring the new 500e to north america
2020-12-20,YouTube Comment,i must admit and i think they are expensive and i have heard other people say the same they are waiting for the prices to come down for small cars they are still too expensive
2020-12-20,YouTube Comment,i was all set to gush at how youve turned a download of tech info into a sumptuous visual and auditory experience until you said you were getting out of those clothes as theyre making you feel a bit awkward so ive changed tack ditch the shirt if you like but ffs keep the pants and boots they suit you perfectly
2020-12-19,YouTube Comment,this is not true to the 500 spirit anymore this is a car for people who would buy ice cream for their dogs and wear prada slippers

2020-12-12,YouTube Comment,im honestly hoping for a 124 electric version maybe based on some of the battery tech in this ive always wanted a lightweight roadster but cant excuse buying a gas car ever again
2020-12-12,YouTube Comment,1050 the real drawback of the zoe is the limitation to 46kw charging whereas the 500e will do 85kw doesnt matter all that much in the city but there you dont really need the increased range of the zoe either but for that long range trip once in a while it makes a huge difference and the 500e is quite a bit cheaper as well if renault offered a 75kw charging option for the zoe it would be the better value
2020-12-12,YouTube Comment,this is a beautiful car and very good video
2020-12-12,YouTube Comment,as an italian i can say that fiat is very bad at innovation except for this car they finally understood that you dont have to go too much futuristic when making electric cars i just wish that acceleration was a bit faster 5 sec 060 or something
2020-12-11,YouTube Comment,good reviews on this channel a bit cheeky great stuff

2020-12-09,YouTube Comment,when you mentioned the eup its worth noting the citigoe iv dropped off the market a while back too after just only a few short months you cant even buy a petrol citigo anymore
2020-12-09,YouTube Comment,yet again another ecar review that completely overlooks interior environment factors im referring to heating and cooling is this vehicle able to keep you warm and in winter cool in summer can it heat enough to clear ice and snow off the windshield if it can how much energy will it take and what impact will it have on the range how about a littles less attention to frivolous details like decals and and a little more attention to whether its a realistic and practical option
2020-12-09,YouTube Comment,a themed car review very good
2020-12-09,YouTube Comment,whats the effect on performance with change in weather temperature i live in utah where the annual temperature swing is 40c to 15c what happens to battery performance under these conditions also how well do they work with steep inclines theres a canyon on i80 thats steep enough to kill off a few motor homes per year they usually catch firewhats the ev battery drain like on hills

2020-12-08,YouTube Comment,hey jonny id just like to add that i thought your production value was great on this possibly just possibly a bit too much slomo but im being picky i just love your content its whats missing on tv yes i enjoy top gear but its an entertainment show that uses cars as props i particularly like your reviews on electric cars and specifically the retro fits well done for jfdi and youre doing it brilliantly i also think the name change is a good move
2020-12-08,YouTube Comment,another electric junk the abarth is cool this is lame
2020-12-07,YouTube Comment,i like it may prefer the older model style wise but this is cool but id still probably look at the zoe for the extra range im super excited to see where we stand in 2 3 maybe 4 years with evs so many seem to fear these cars im excited zoe got updated recently more range and better interior and exterior touch ups as you know ofc kia is bringing a new platform next year look very exciting 300 mile range and stuff
2020-12-07,YouTube Comment,johnny the reason it was sold in ca and or is for carb california air resource board compliance for the manufacturer theres a requirement that in order to sell gas or diesel cars in ca you have to have an electric vehicle for sale in ca as well these compliance cars have all been universally acknowledged as junk httpsenwikipediaorgwikicompliance_car
2020-12-07,YouTube Comment,great review jonny nice setting music and i even liked the car

2020-12-07,YouTube Comment,thought you might have mentioned the 500 31 theres a shot of it at 1453 pretty interesting on a car this small
2020-12-07,YouTube Comment,jonny smith is the only man who should review electric cars cant watch fc without him anymore he has a great eye for design and is competent to the satisfaction just love him
2020-12-07,YouTube Comment,ah digbeth i remember it well used to commute up down the m1 to spend the week at the ford depot whilst visiting all the wonderful engineering companies in the area such a watchable production love the cap how many gillettes inside so refreshing compared to these artificial official reviews such as recent lrj defender contrived rubbish
2020-12-06,YouTube Comment,greatest review the only issue i miss is the range issue many people will get burned by range is 320 wltp but in winter it will be maybe 23 of that but on the freewaymotorway in winter at 130kmh that will be i am thinking 100km instead of 300km range around big cities there are fast roads that people need to take to the workplace
2020-12-06,YouTube Comment,1156 to 1208 minutes hahaha dodgy roll up windows up smoking jokes
2020-12-06,YouTube Comment,great review jonny but you ruined the immersion with your last sentence
2020-12-06,YouTube Comment,another great video from jonny smith former 2014 500e owner from the us here current gm bolt ev owner my two favorite new evs have to be the honda e the new 500e and tie for third would be the zoe eup all of which are unavailable in us maybe i need to move cheers
2020-12-06,YouTube Comment,fantastic review so stylish so different so 500
2020-12-06,YouTube Comment,if youre ever about to splurge that capital has no nationality please take a moment to remember that fiat decided to move the production of their successful small car away from one of the best fcas factories in terms of production quality and back to well italy after they already did that with new panda and sacked 1500 people in 2012 yeah no nationality at all
2020-12-06,YouTube Comment,worst tv percenter ever
2020-12-06,YouTube Comment,just review the car stop talking nonsense no details whatsoever about the car gimmicks and how it drives
2020-12-06,YouTube Comment,great car in great settings

2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,not more ev
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,fantastic review jonny and the 500 looks really cool we have had 3 500s over the last 10 years and if we were looking for a new car this would be top of the list thanks
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,1259 i dont see how you can charge up to 427kw in 1525 hours on a 3kw input
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,semiuseful city runabout but 20k more than it should be
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,fiat are masters at small cars it is a pity they dont really bother with them anymore they did not even replace the punto there was a 127 concept that looked fantastic they did nothing with it is it the market though does noone want a small car anymore we will soon all be driving dull as dishwater suvs and cuvs they literally all pretty much look the same except the mitsubishi eclipse cross they have at least tried to make an effort of doing something different the reward they are leaving the uk market in entirety
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,why why did they ruin it such a classic car turned into a watereddown ev
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,i have liked the most recent 500 here in the states but it is smaller then i am ready to go the cabriolet is really neat as an ev pushing up on 200 miles it does feel like a really nice option i like the mini e and have an i3 rex but the range on the mini makes me pause thanks for an interesting review looking forward to being able to take one of these out for a test drive
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,is this the car pervert channel
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,this 500e is perfect for the week than the amg c63 507 for the weekend 😂
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,how do evs handle snow ive not seen or heard anything about that subject
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,disappointing 0 to 60 slower than the california 500e more modern but less charming wish i had one of those batteries tho
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,amber brake lights thats how you roll in europe
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,seems that fiat is going to make it a brand of its own just that big 500 logo and no fiat anywhere
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,id say that in these ev reviews you should check how fast they charge depending on the battery charge level etc maybe thats not very relevant for small ones that arent going to go in a long trip but for the rest is important in my opinion
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,are fiat so tight they only bring one car to the uk gc 760nr has been round every youtube reviewer this week but i think yours was the first out
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,very nice exterior electric for the masses
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,very amusing thanks jonny enjoyed this its a nice car fiat drl includes taillights too fix it
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,if i have enough money i would choose fiat 500e
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,i reckon fiat have hit it out of the park with this especially in terms of body stylinggorgeous evolution
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,this car is perfect as an ev
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,great review by looking at the rivals if you mention the zoe you also have to mention the e208 and corsa the look just much better
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,this causes a dilemma i bought a used powder blue fiat 500 mk2 2013 for my daughter a few years back special birthday v lucky girl and she we all love its it for some reason puts a smile on my face when i see it this ev 500 is on point styling range options and your presentation is just brilliant got to say it for me its up there with figaro evs are the future and this has to be a winner
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,why is it always the top spec modelas not many ever buy that one as its too expensive
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,proud owner of a 72 convertible 500 here the car makes me smile every single time i sit in it fuel consumption is near zero sunny days are happy days and every single date is a success the ev will make you spend near 0 on gas make you enjoy the three sunny daysyear in britain and hopefully become a father within 10 minutes from escaping the talian mob after you are caught the padrinos doughter
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,i have to admit its a bloody good looking car i understand your predicament with the honda e though its equally as cool and fashionable but the interior is so unique
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,good thank you for changing your name a growing channel called car pervert were hard to recommend
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,but no brake light if in single pedal mode
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,i think that you are right in that the 500e will bring interest to the whole electric car thing the one thing that disappointed me about it was the fact that it doesnt have regen on demand matt farah said it was one of the fun things about his chevy volt not using any petrol or brakes and as it is only programming and a couple of levers it seems a shame to leave it out
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,disappointing it would have been nice to hear from a 500 enthusiast who knew more about the cars im not interested in his clothes or birmingham he told us nothing just how he liked other cars more
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,the production of this clip matches the car beautiful keep it up please jonny and team
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,the most beautiful little car in the worldbut a battery is no alternativean abarth though
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,looking really smart jonny i was waiting for your review of this car and as with the many others you have done its a good one
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,i won the original 500e imported from us to norway i love it its not for everyone sure its small and the interior quality is well not the best but i love it and my bmw stays in the garage 90 of the time now its small its sort of fast up to 7080kph and the range is good enough to drive tofrom work its fun this new one seems to fix most of the issues without straying too far from what the 500 is
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,love this car i have the first gen ev500 and i love it never going back to a piston engine again
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,ha i notice how you drove past from a outside shot sun in eyes and you couldnt put the sun visor all way down to block the sun because clearly you would have zero vision of the road you held the visor a few cm down lol you should mention thisclearly you are too tall for this car because you should be able to see with the visor down still
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,i cant drive any car with the sun visor all the way down it comes down to seat adjustment as well remember
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,basically long range you will get at a push 140 miles and the city car pushing 8090 miles real world range and while some look at this car as cheapthough places state the lowest model price to make it look cheaper than what it is the lease prices are 100 more than other much better ev cars
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,a class review those rear steering wheel audio buttons exactly the same as my jeep i think all cars should have them so easy to use
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,i was a bit skeptical about the look of the car but its growing on me especially after your video wow
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,ridiculously overpriced toy for dentists wives to demonstrate their ecoconsciousness for all serious matters they will keep using their cayenne though
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,best ev review ever liked use of charts and music better channel name as well
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,all enjoyable production values aside what really stands out for me is that jonny is not the usual kind of talented and knowledgeable youtuber but a proper journalist who really knows how to tell a story how to deliver facts and how to make a point i dont even drive a car or want one but i watch your videos with pleasure
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,looks a little too aggressive for an ootseycutesy runabout will it capture the same target market as before only time will tell
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,its utter agony that fiat wont just pull the trigger and electrify the panda range id be first in line for an electric panda cross
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,me too but sadly not enough people care about the panda any more
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,i absolutely miss the basic battery version as convertible this is what you need in the city you dont need 300km range dragging dead weight every day
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,when e cars use regen braking comes to a halt when you lift off the power pedal do the brake lights come on to tell the driver behind you that youre coming to a stop
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,usually chevy bolt does bmw i3 too
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,wow theyve done a great job with this car
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,im subscribed to about 60 car channels and this channel is probably up there with my top 3 need i say more i also see the subscriber count is shooting up so i guess a lot of people agree
2020-12-06,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow haha i would do the same funny i used to watch you on fifth gear as a young teen and could never imagine being able to talk to you or other presenters nowadays good ol youtube has changed all that
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,wouldnt it be great if the car pervert and fullycharged teamed up😊
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,another extremely well done video mate but now ive gotta rewatch your honda e review
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,fiat 500 as an ice is a pos so is the electric one any less
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,vw should bring back beetle as an ev
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,good one johnny been waiting for a good review on this little baddy so disappointing we probably wont get it in australia no govt incentives available here backwards bastards oh reckon you could add some metric numbers to the onscreen specs cards for us properly metric folk down here 😀
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,i really wish the fiats we got in the us were better made as they appear to be in europe
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,you knowits probably and excellent vehicle but it looks like a blob i would buy it if i wanted a super reliable city car but as i parked it and walked off i wouldnt turn back to look at it
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,ev is easy to maintain and hassle free
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,nothing like a bit of racial stereotyping to flesh out a simple car review
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,i think that fiat is going to make it a brand of it own
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,jonnys back definitely car review with a story love it
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,congrats on 200k sir oh and a blinder 😉of a review once again thank you
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,great review as always really enjoyed it i think it comes down to the fact of do you want a 4 seat ev cabrio or not if the answer is yes then theres not much else if anything to choose from
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,looks very like an adam particularly the chrome trim round the side windows to the point id say theyve bought the design or its a joint enterprise and we will see an adam ev soon looks nice but expensive particularly for a fiat 500 part of the 500s charm was its classless pricing our first was a top of the range panorama glass roof twin air 50mpg second one was a 12 sport 65mpg one 10500 other 12500 new ive bought 2 for less than that one and had change for a motorbike
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,why is it strange that this piece of rubbish was only sold in california and oregon answer plain as the nose on your face is that it is a compliance car fiat is resisting going into ev like a virgin into a adult toys shop fiat has no desire to sell these and makes them only because the penalty for not doing so is onerous this car is redundant even before you buy it its only redeeming factor is that its ev and for everyone sold wont be that many an ice car is left unsold
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,you are mistaking the old 500 electric compliance car with this one designed to be electric because the electric cars market is exploding
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,neutronalchemist3241 you have been drawn in by the hype dont for one minute think that fiat is making evs because they want to make evs they like all legacy automakers would far far prefer to not make evs at all ever these companies have been dragged kicking and screaming and crying howls of protest into the ev arena because of three main reasons 1 civilised countries are going to ban the sale of new ice vehicles within the next 10 years 2 ice cars are increasingly penalised with emissions fines which is starting to really hurt them 3 the public is finding evs more economically attractive total cost of ownership not sticker price and in addition are seeing cars like tesla as very desirable tesla was the only car maker to make good profist during the covid pandemic every other car maker suffered big losses fiat is making this piece of rubbish only because they have no choice not becuase they want to
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,brunosmith6925 every company would prefer to do what it has always done but the sales of electric cars in europe rised 50 every year in the last 5 yearsthe actual situation is that if you are a car maker and wants to remain relevant you have to manufacture electric vehicles so what fiat does manufacture electric vehicles thats not building compliance car its building what the market is asking for thats what manufacturers exist for
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow i know i appreciate that and i normally watch them there just seem many more than usual and all at annoying points just as you were about to say something
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow this video should have been named fiat 500e peaky blinders review edition could generate better seo
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,i think that rear wheel drive is the way to go with evs and i used to think otherwise but that is one of the big appealing features of the honda e
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,thats one car shape im sick of seeing almost as bad as the not so mini
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,i work in digbeth its wild seeing johnny drive past my office
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,very enjoyable review the underlying music alongside jonnys dresscode is phenomenal beautiful car also thank you
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,i like it but ill never buy it because i know its a compliance car
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,but if a compliance car is good does that matter
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,i have made due with the range of my 2014 500e with no issues put 40000km on it family of 4 2 dogs no problem
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,great video and a funky car the production of this film is faultless great job loving your content
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,i am a glutton for punishment i am unable to drive but ache to be able to drive specially these electric cars i would instantly buy the fiat 500e
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,the production values of this video are outstanding the use of the slides to show vehicle comparisons and represent information graphically was really informative great work
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,looks great will be interesting to know leasing costs no dodgy ice drivetrain to go wrong italian electrics bits of it are south korean at least
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,great review johnny
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,awesome review best one so far
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,i like the videos but i dont think i have seen so many adverts in such a short space of time if this is how its going to be i will probably unsubscribe
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,very good to see who does long trips in a fiat 500 anyway the hot version of this should be entertaining when it eventually comes
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,i really hope they do an electric abarth 500 that would genuinely make me convert to electric
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,so much better than the fully charged video
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,enjoyed this video despite the unusual attire will fancy dress based upon location now feature in future videos must be the least gangster like car around looks a fabulous vehicle for those with urban mobility needs and easy access to charging disappointed that no ice version exists the original new fiat 500 also gets better looking by the day a great little car for those on a tight budget
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,i love these reviews jonny but that gang in farnborough will be after you for incorrect use of mini in the graphics they really dont like lower case letters
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,wonderful review this has quickly become my nr 1 go to channel for car reviews jonny knows his stuff whilst striking a great balance between being serious about the facts and being entertaining this channel made me order a mini electric i personally prefer the mini but the fiat and the honda e are great lookers too the more we see of these three cars on the road the better
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,i think fiat have done a really good job i like the design overall apart from the silly bonnet eyebrows shouldve just left the headlights as they are without that embellishment
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,in india we have tata nexon electric with good range and in competitive price range this fiat is lovely
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,nice test jonny 2 things price italian electrics
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,it is the best little electric car available today good pricerange and styledimension ratios
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,strange ive not seen one reviewer try and get in the back seats
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,what happens if youre in an accident regarding door buttons can you still get out or if theres a power failure will you be stuck in there forever lol
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,happy 200k edit 1301 427 kwh blimey missing a comma there i think
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,love the new fiat cool watch what kind of watch
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,i really like this all to often im seeing manufacturers reinterpretations of their existing models and completely destroy them in order to appear electric this one really has hit the nail on the head though
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,could you please talk more about seat adjustability steering wheel rake etc because the last time i drove a 500 it was the most uncomfortable car i have ever driven
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,1453 is that a clamshell door like on the previous clubman
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,320 what are you talking about the 500e is also available in a new fourdoor version 3 doors plus trunk door i actually think that is the most interesting version because it makes sitting in the back less of a torture
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,sexyboththe car and the mankeep the clothes
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,just amazed by how good it looks it looks exactly how youd imagine a modern ev 500 would look
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,i 3 has it beat on cup holders and thats what you need for a city car
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,im sorry johnny i live in the twin cities minesota i maybe see only one fiat 500 on the road here once every 3 months they just dont sell well here the main fiat dealership in st louis park mn still has brand new fiat 500s still in stock on the lot from the past few years for sale as for evs in this area there are more nissan leafs tesla model ss model 3s being sold here everyday tesla opened a dealership here in eden prairie mn a few years back i do have a great childhood memory of my dad bringing home two used fiats during the summer of 84 he worked as a used car salesman than in 1984 he successively brought home a cherry red 1979 fiat spyder 2000 a dark burgundy 1982 fiat x19 off of his dealership lot to tool around in he ended up selling the x19 to a neighbor across the street our neighbor kept the x19 for a number of years until he traded it for a porche 928s
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,i wouldnt call this a global car given that north america is excluded we lost the regular fiat 500 too about a year or two ago i absolutely love my 2012 and would only replace it with a convertible ev
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,the fiat 500 comes in 3 different model styles but unfortunately they all look virtually the same very feminine styling seems like fiat has given they design staff 3 years off can we please have a new bravo replacement
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,what an exceptionally well designed car
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,the plastic around the gear select and drive mode looks cheap
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,it isnt necessarily cheaper though but range vs cost is best
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,pretty cool but they shouldve made it rear engine rwd like the original
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,i drive when it doesnt stop for a while when the 499cc engines warmed up just let it cool down a 50 year old 500l this looks an excellent addition to the ev world compared to mine this new one is huge😆 its all relative of course well done fiat back to doing what they do best good small cars
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,good production nice stylish little car good job jonny
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,hilariously tesla competition already hitting the wall of limited battery production
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,finally a really good looking budget ev ty fiat ps this roof is a joke
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,i do like this above all the others youve reviewed ill take this and the honda for a test drive in the new year
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,1304 427kwh would be long range indeed
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,what a great little car i think its really cool also the cinematography and graphics are coming along in leaps and bounds its a serious quality production now nice job jonny
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,what a sexy little car i gave up driving about a year or so ago in favour of mountainbiking to work although there are times i miss having the flexibility of a car and if i were to enter the market again itd be for this
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,well if the mini e rides even half as badly as the petrol one its awful plus its far too difficult to get in and out of the 500 is just wonderful honda yes but a hopeless range and too expensive
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,liking you dropped the p word love what you do but it just felt like an out dated term that doesnt suit your content really good review
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,agree with so many comments here a totally watchable entertaining and informative review again they seem to get better and better jonny i think youre totally right about how this expands the interest on this kind of ev and not to deliver a verdict choice should be a personal thing and happily we do seem to be emerging into a world where there are reasonable and well designed alternatives
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,i just watched your friends view on this car fully charged show
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,superb presentation in depth knowledgeable review with style and humour i love the tiein with birminghams old italian quarter and doesnt jonny carry the peaky blinders look with bravura
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,another good bit of jonny but why is organ grinding a skill all you do is crank a handle mate the monkey does the hard work had to stop watching the fully charged show because kryton got on my tits with his relentless evangelising about all things electric so no idea if mr smith still appears there he was the only reason i kept with it so long as i bought that ev brainwashing completely until i explored formyself and discovered the huge inconvenience and extra costs that were glossed over as far as range lets see some realistic actual mileage quoted as well as the meaningless claims got tosay though that then500 is a masterpiece of great design in all iterations maybe a 400 mile abarth firebreathing version might sway me but if i had to go for a small ev the honda e or renault zoe would be one of only three id look at but realistically ill stick my 12 year old german planet burner btw my thoughts when i hear sherpa is to see everest
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,love the chic look of the car range is not bad great review plan and simple but with a bit of comedy as well nice one mate
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,nice to see you smart for once you scruffy herbert great review again you make dull things interesting tell you what else i like is your little note book love seeing you refer to that
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,thank you for the comprehensive video description i often check it to find additional info and find them lacking also thank you for properly using the time links for the chapters of the video and thank you for your wonderful wonderful videos
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,i wish manufacturers would share the charging curve maximum power input is about as useful as maximum power output
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,i want to replace my petrol citigo with the electric version but as you say finding one is like hens teeth this though makes me excited
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,lmao that power off sound is awful
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,great review jonny and love the car small point im pretty sure certain editions of the 500 come with 17 alloys as do most abarths some even have 18s 😱
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,looks pretty cool tbh had no idea they already made an electric 500
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,great video you missed the opportunity cliché of going to electric avenue not a million miles from where you were
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,how jonny is continuing to put out this level of quality content each week is so impressive its so well thought out well shot and thats not a moments work dont forget to sleep jonny but stunning work
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,the first electric version came out only in the states on direct request of president obama to marchionne after the fiat and chrysler fusion it was put together very quick and probably not quite good this is a proper ev from top to bottomso its probably better no one could be able to buy it back in 2013cheers from italy
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,got my mg zs ev for 21500 how can these manufacturers justifie these prices
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,people will pay for style and this isnt exactly much differently priced
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,thomas shelbyyou need to be carrol shelby
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,great review and all credit to michael rockperring and inkshark studio some cracking good footage
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,this is the best review ive seen so informative the style and especially the range is a deal breaker for me but i would like to see a choice in style of the wheels as i dont like them cheers
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,the previous 500e was a compliance car made to be sold only in california because california mandated any manufacture must sell an ev if they want continue to sell their ice cars and california being one of the largest car markets in the world fca really had no choice
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,the citigo iv stopped at only 400 imported into the uk you can order a seat mii electric or vw eup
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,its not much of a jump up to a honda which means that you dont need to deal with the fca after sales service but then its not that much of a jump up from the honda to a tesla which gets you that charging network plus 400 km range which means its a complete petrol replacement not a second car if youre ok with the size of the tesla
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,whoever did your graphics should be praised very slick very clear very nice congrats
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,dear mister jonny i really like your reviews you put a lot of effort in it
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,to whoever its handling the video production and edit bravo
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,nice comprehensive review jonny is clearly one of the best car reviewers on youtube however i do think this video could easily have been wrapped up in 10 minutes instead of 19
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,dont get out those clothes youll upset your grandfather thomas shelby especially being in birmingham 😂 im with you on this new fiat 500 e it is clearly italian styling and that colour of blue is just beautiful fit and finish and materials of the car look really well done not like some others in this category for this price and 199 miles range is really quite good i am with you though when it comes to honda e it just has that snippet that will draw everyone in and make them love it more and i would live with the range of 137 miles that means you charge it once or twice a week more which is peanuts compared to filling up with petrol our hydro in manitoba canada is the cheapest in north america hovering around 58 centskhr so this means the honda e will cost me an extra 34 a week to run you can barely buy a coffee at starbucks for that money and i know the honda e is a little more money and you get the honda quality and reliability which goes on for years it has more cool factor than the 500 e does the 500 e has more of that italian styling thing going on id still take the honda e rwd and snow tires itll be fine and it has its own form of traction control which will be good in our canadian winters great review mr shelby i am rebuilding a 2002 golf gls right now with really quite reasonable kilometres on it and the body is excellent shape so i have something to keep me busy this winter great video as usual jonny
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,so much more interesting than a normal boring review really created an atmosphere now the bar is set high for future themed reviews good luck and great work
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,im not kidding in san francisco last week a fiat 500 hit the back of a truck at least 810 mph and every air bag in the car went off the door air bags too but why the door bags it was right next to me the women couldnt find the door handle to get out thanks
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,every review of an ev talks about range a lot im so tired of even hearing about it i keep wanting a honda e despite the range then youre a fool if you dont own one mate you know what people dont talk about very much the actual range of ice cars i mean in a review of a new ice car some mention of the range for that particular car its very rare you know why because range doesnt really matter so much this clean technica article from 2016 said the median range for ice was 412 miles 50 of ice vehicles in 2016 got less than 412 miles on a tank remember back in 2016 when everyone was complaining about ice range me neither why did i link an article from way back in 2016 because i couldnt find a more recent article on the subject of ice range i just know that some ice muscle cars you know the ones competing for market share with model 3s and taycans and lucid airs have ranges under 200 miles lets rangeshame them range anxiety to me its range insanity wake up and smell the cheap abundant electricity everywhere httpscleantechnicacom20160826electricvehiclerangesexceedgasolinepoweredvehicleschart
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,those are some of the nicest wheels i have ever seen
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,what a shame the base model is priced well but only does about 10 miles real world range another swing and a miss 😭
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,looks quite funky as a design appeal from the outside its definitely better than the honda
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,i must be one of the few people who really dont like the styling of the honda e i think the fiat is leaps and bounds better looking and the city model is significantly cheaper the mini although still a city car is a different type of car it is primarily about performance and luxury ranter than styling that isnt to say the mini isnt a good looking car too i would definitely have the fiat over the honda yet another great review
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,lovely clothes on you nice car review to
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,great review jonny and greetings from australia i would love to see this car here and punt it around orange nsw fca australia make me an offer i cant refuse
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,a fine channel that drives a further nail into old school tv while being old school thanks for cheering me up
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,the earlier 500e had a bosch drive system who does the new versions motor and electronics
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,johnny man what are you doing i love your videos but this one has too many adverts despite that adverts you have a way of making feel like ive driven that car when i clearly havent which is a testament to your skill
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,good homework the detailed information makes all the difference ive seen the other reviews and ive got the same opinion the honda e its the one although for fiat i reckon its a real grownup product very interesting for the price range and no doubt a competitive one to look for the italians just gave to the design that extra flare which makes it desirable
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,that looks bloody brilliant everything an electric car should be and needs to be perfect for the city interesting and cool
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,it looks promising but a its a fiat made by fiat chrysler group and b chrysler complete shiite we all know it if anyone can take promising and turn it into garbage its chrysler
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,jonny that was a brilliant review just what i want from a car programme keep up the great work mate
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the battery is to small period with an option of minuscule or outdated flagship smaller than a zoe is hard to justify if your outside a city commute
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great review jonny love the new graphics as well detailed review and comparisons too love it
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,jonny you have never looked better than in that outfit honestly and i love this new ev 500 it gives hope to us all that the electric future isnt going to be bland and blobby but interesting and stylish great video
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,hard top fiat 500 has a 3rd door option it is a bit weird and i havent seen it yet but is only on one side
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,beautiful design details the italians know what theyre doing shades the honda by a mile
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i came here for car and i got history
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,congrats on over 200k subs johnny im super curious if you would do a review on your old killa drag car ev with how youve embraced evs i bet a throwback video of that little yellow beast could seriously increase viewership
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,many thanks i have considered it the car is no longer mine but i do have some home video shot during the build and early development of it that has never seen the light of day might use it
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow man i for one would seriously enjoy watching all of those clips thank you from one car nut to another for producing such truly high quality drama free pure carvana content 😎 im putting the under on you getting to 1000000 subs by 2022 also would you consider doing something on the upcoming pure etcr electric racing series
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i like the designthumbs up

2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,just watched bobbys review of this car on fully charged he likes it even more great honest review thanks
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,well done for changing the name of the channel this is more like it the review was great informative fun well laid out two thumbs up
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,why is it compulsory to have ugly wheels on an ev
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,it seems that way although i like the honda e gas hobs and mini e uk plugs
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow yeah fair points there though they seem to be the exceptions rather than the rule
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,nope no money to restore it yet so havent gone beyond getting brakes working and driving it back to my house sorry it will have to wait a bit longer
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i am not a fan of the production version of the honda e the boot of the fiat is a little small and wouldnt be the most practical choice even so i think it looks amazing inside and out and i would definitely consider the long range version
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,another great review jonny ill take it over the mini its better looking
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,very stylish very dapper car pretty good too
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,lovely to look at cute and stylish just like the previous model but has the same failure it is about as practical as a chocolate fireguard seats 4 but 2 can only be children and only 2 doors so access to rear is difficult eup and co have 5 doors more room and bigger boot not got the style or fashion appeal tho fiat really need a panda e to have a practical family city car now that would be an interesting and usable city runabout panda e 4x4 anyone
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,another excellent review and raised the bar with the production quality i used to watch fully charged but they are a joke compared to this channel
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,this is such a fantastic piece of design theyve really refined stephensons original and now it just looks spot on a very desirable little thing
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,it is a good looking car particularly in that colour
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,it makes no sense whatsoever but id still rather have the honda e thats exciting as i wasnt sure id ever say that about an electric car
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,sorry this isnt very pc but the fiat 500 is a girls car if honda did its e with competitive range it would be a no brainer
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,a few days ago i did watch a 500e test by a german guy i do prefer the british style yours for example thank you grüße aus deutschland martin
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,really liked your take on how one could review a car jonny you are probably one of the best along side mr harris 😉 i have one request could you please add range info in km as well so that i we dont have recalculate all the numbers shown stay safe
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great video love the late brake show
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great review as always and dressed up too this is now the go to channel for great entertaining history lesson ev reviews 😀
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,if i was looking for an ev this would be a strong contender nice wee thing btw jonny love the channel its brilliant and so look forward to watching it also like your particular style of presenting its so refreshing keep up the good work
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i had one of the original 500es glad you mentioned that one it was my firstever ev i leased one here in san diego from 2014 to 2017 for my 60mile roundtrip commute it was a really fun little car and with some creative packing could fit my entire drum set in the back leaving the passenger seat open i wish they added dc charging and more range over the years but they didnt seem interested ended up replacing it with an i3 and then a model 3 after that this looks like a perfect successor i kind of hope it makes it back here one day i might just have one in my driveway again
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i am begging fiat usa to sell this in the zev states here in usa im your first customer gordon from washington dc
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,honda e and mini are a failing ev both 2015 range well done fiat a winner in 42kw version some reason to buy smaller battery for some city dwellers
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i like the video production the car well knowing their history of of how well they dont hold up i hope they have upped the quality control i use to work at an auto auction in california saw a bunch of the original 500es come through and got auctioned off most only went for a few thousand dollars
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i vowed as a teenager that id never own another fiat after several painful years with my disastrous 124 sport coupe which was more rust than steel at the end my favorite part of the video is mendelssohns italian symphony which is so evocative and quietly reflective as nice as the car is ill take the symphony any day of the week jonny of course is excellent as always
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great review congratulations on reaching 200k subscribers ive just become one of them
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,im interested in this i love the honda e but the specs for the price knocks it out of the consideration immediately turning on a dime isnt as useful as going 200 miles
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,that looks better than the mini electricthat is like a guccithe mini is like a levislol
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i prefer the lever type gear shifterpush forward if you want to go forwardand pull backward if you want to back upthat is easier and faster to do if you are trying to escape from something and want to move fast
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,this video was ridiculous so many things i love birmingham peaky blinders cinquecento italy evs late break show of course proper job
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,top quality material as usual from jonny one of the most honest car journalists
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,beautifully filmed plenty of comparison data excellent if living in a city with a 5 mile commute then more than a weeks worth of range in the city version
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,winter range will be less batteries dont like the cold
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,so good review
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,really like how your videos and style are evolving keep the upward trajectory going
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,still 30k for a top spec tiny fiat
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,wow what a great video im actually taken aback by how much i enjoyed this a proper review too graphics content delivery the whole deal is great compared to other car review channels this is above and way beyond but then again the late brake show is in a league of its own following you since fifth gear johnny top job keep it up love from pakistan
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,even for a fiat 500 this thing is ugly
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,that door motor is noisey as fuck not ideal for doing back alley sov ring man type jobs you aint seen me right
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,made me smile u saying eup in that hat with that scenery and the music
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,what an excellent video jonny nice car too im not sure why ive a draw towards the mini e though even though its an old shape now and hasnt a fantastic range
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great review however i cant quite understand what is the view looking at the rear seats 1455 looks like a suicide door as its not the car in the test
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,im glad to see that im not the only one who likes the crz its an underappreciated gem in my opinion id love an electric version of it if it wasnt so expensive id look at getting one converted
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,an electric car from a nation thats regarded to produce the worst automotive electrics for the sake of the future owners i hope its not a case of the usual italian automotive electrics
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,there is not a huge difference in price compared to the id3 with the small battery the 500e is not a cheapo but looks really good i would like to have this as a rental when arriving somewhere with the train or plane with the big battery for the city it is really fine and attractive i did not expect to see such a nice car coming from fiat
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,this has the benefit that its based on a piston fiat 500 while the honda e is a brand new car its good competition but if i had the choice id get the honda e still well presented review and thanks so much for the timestamps
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the late brake show jonny can you explain why subsequent generations of car are always slightly bigger than the car they replace it seems to have been going on for as long as i can remember eventually cars seem to shift up a category and the a new small car is introduced to fill the gap is that an intentional strategy i dont get it
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,beautiful short film and beautifully produced a new late brake show video is always first on the list
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,fantastic review jonny
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,really enjoyable review what would be a peaky blinder car colorinterior combo
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,try twingo electric and compare
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,excellent review johnny going from strength to strength
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i like that good to see ashton engineering sign still up that was the place for su carbs
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,my god im 62 years old and hardly remember su also amal carbs on bsatriumph bikes
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thanks jonny a sane nonhysterical review i am in thailand so we have to wait but my original fiats were cars to love this might just be the e car for me
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,range range range got any spare change
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,nice review nice car very nice looking car nice music choice too quality job again if i missed peaky blinder refs sorry i didnt watch it
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,nice looking car and nicely filmed too
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,really enjoy your vt and like the car can see it parked bumper to bumper in a roma street covered in tree sap
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,one add fine two ok but four jonny might not have any say in how many adds but if you do id watch that personally ive unsubscribed because of such last was a 9 minute clip with five breaks and that was enough to think yeah click great wee car it needs a sport mode surly just for that ten to twenty miles of twisty roads every so often to keep the car interesting couldnt buy it still on range as we do road trips and holidays honda e and mini se would be on the drive if it did 200300 miles real world getting there but will a tesla two door compact be a game changer in the segment in a few years
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,dont we already have fully charged for all those ev fetishists
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,look back at my videos there are ev classic piston modified and car stories this is not pure ev
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow i know mate i really enjoy all those episodes i just feel like this ev thing is getting shoved down my throat and i appreciate that this is probably going to be the near future for motoring perhaps im just a dinosaur and my extinction is just around the corner
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,that turin cityscape and old 500 drawing are very chrysler easter egg
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,whilst im yet to be convinced the e is anywhere as green as the man would have us believe i much prefer these to sticking ev in classics its going to be interesting to see how the economy copes with the loss of the ice and all the associated people parts enthusiasts modifiers racers etc etc when they try and ban fossil fuels
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,best one yet outstanding review
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,in 2022 ill get one hopefully prices drop a bit by then
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,nice more choice is always good preetty car
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,very nice and informative video thanks a lot first one of your channel i watched what i was wondering about what does this car sound like if youre outside of it lets say if youre a pedestrian and this car is zooming by what do you hear only the tires or more dont know how you would objectively need to measure it but id be curious to know not just for this car but for every ev youll test if in the future all cars are electric the roads will probably be quiet and because of that dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists oh and what does it sound like when youre inside the car greetings from holland rob
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i still cant understand why all evs are one pedal and why they dont just stop completely when you lift off it takes all of about 3 minutes to get used to this and its ime totally intuitive press more to go faster lift more to slow down stay the same to go the same speed simple easy intuitive anything else paddles modes or god forbid having to press the brake pedal to regen is just stupid imo ive driven an i3 for 5 years now and iev used the actual brake pedal ooh about twice in all that time
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,some beautiful filming here making use of that harsh morning light especially that early scene as jonny drives through that tall archway a tv advert quality shot fratello signor rockperring this 500ev is going to sell like espressos on a cold morning quite deservedly too interesting competitors each really reflecting its country of origin i think good work all round late brakers
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,electric and any italian cars dont mix
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,am i the only one that thinks the face is very feminine thebad boy bonnet serves to give the lights eyelashes and the lower grille creates a cute little smile all in all and whichever way it appears to the onlooker i think fiat got it just right
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,excellent honest review jonny
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,hi jon great car have the petrol version tell me please what watch are you wearing in this video thanks wayne
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,if abarth get their hands on it i may just have to get my first ev 😬
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i dont know who filmed this for you but i have to say that was a superb piece of work being fairly local it was strange seeing a review set in digbeth but it was excellent the car look great too
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,much as i enjoy rob llewellyn im pleased to watch a full review of the new 500e as a current 500c driver im really interested to see if this is a tenable replacement for the petrol car im not surprised you struggled to reach a conclusion youre not the target audience
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,a beautiful looking car fiat have done an excellent job good rival to the honda e but not quite as much power better range but do you need that every day unlikely
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great review dark but delightful sadly we will not get these cars here in s africa
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,as an american that owned one of these in this same color lol i am absolutely devastated they arent coming to the us i was prepared to buy another one and that dream was killed so quick
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the quality of your videos is so good your genuine passion and knowledge about cars really shines trough humble and personable too cant belive your not sponsored yet
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,it would be interesting to see this car compared to the new twingo the twingo is not as posh as the 500 but size and range seems comparable to the range of the cheaper one
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,hey car pervert which one of your parents was the meerkat
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,you win robert is the man but this review is better
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great review of the car but an italian car so lets make a connection with peaky blinders and gangster and mafia really again i am very tired of this attitude
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,im a current first gen owner and love it as my commuter this new gen is perfect with the better range would allow travel round trip to many locations without recharge i really hope they change their mind and bring it to the states or at least to california
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i think that looks fantastic great view as always jonny never seen digbeth so quiet
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,what a charming little thing i think this size is perfect for ev adoption as youve said jonny hope to see these out and about
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,love it i am little sad they made it so much larger in all dimensions but it is still beautiful for a city driving it is a great car one thing i would go for is a two tone paintjob that makes it even better looking i would get this over the honda e every day btw recommend trying their vr configurator quite a well made thing httpswwwfiatcom500electricvirtual3dexperience
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,nice review mate we need more entry level evs with good range and less extras that a lot of people dont need or want
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,such a better car review than other rival gangsahemfcahem nuff said
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,loved the you aint seen me car looks ok as well
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,its ok but isnt the most unreliable thing about italian cars the electrics they dont do that great on petrol either haha at least it will get up hills because apparently the 500 gearboxes had issues with that i think honda is more huggable would get more attention for the xtra money and will probably last a lot longer
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i think theyve done a great job with the design and some really interesting colours itll do well
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,nice reviewis the 42 kwh gross or net
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the fiat to me is more stylish than the honda which seems to be one of those quirky japanese designs aimed at their home market
2021-06-24,YouTube Comment,but fiat is italy and therefore eu based and honda is japanese and therefore not eu based
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i was always so against evs as a die hard petrol head until about 6 months ago when i discovered your channel johnny i honestly believe the future wont be as bad as we think it will be for us petrol heads and when 2030 comes there will still be interesting cars on sale
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,sorry but were you a fully charged employee same old story
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,848 jonny go pop round to rg at bicester heritage they supplied some of the cars for the filming
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,if we start a petition to get jonny sponsorship and just over half the people who watch this channel sign it they have to debate it in parliament that will get some attention dont you think come on people in fact i will i just started it click the link to sign the petition httpspetitionparliamentukpetitions562716sponsorsnewtokenjv0l0n3xdg1sjywg_du0 getjonnyasponser
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow no worries made me cackle thinking of them actually having to debate it at 10k we get a response from the government kind of hoping it gets that far now just to see what they say
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,another nice vlog with great camera work imagery and soundmusic love your honest reviews pointing out all the good and bad and even what other cars are better choices have better options and prices love the looks of the 500e and the slightly larger dimensions and wheels actually not a bad look for you as well with your outfit cool little touch with the way they integrated the e inside the 0 of the 500 nice interior the center display didnt look like some slapped on ipad like some other vehicles and the built in wireless phone chargers are nice sounded like it had a really nice quite interior good soundproofing and the motor didnt sound whiny or droning inside the cab while you were talking or as it was driving by on the exterior shots only 4 things i could pick out that i didnt like were 1 the musical startstop is a cute touch that could be fun to show off but i imagine after hearing it dozens and dozens of times it could get annoying 2 i wish the roof would tuck down further for better rear visibility 3 dont like the location of the switches in the center console because they seem like they could be accidentally hit easily 4 really dont like the electric door releases if you have an electrical problem how do you open the door break a window to get out i prefer a hard connection with a normal cable latch because even if the handle or cable broke both doors wouldnt be broken at the same time the way electrically operated doors could be and you could climb across to use the other door when every single thing is electrically operated on an electric car it starts to seem gimmicky and unnecessary and just an extra power drain on the battery even if its just a tiny fraction of power that it uses ditch power door handles get rid of touch screen digital controls for the radio leave the connections on the steering wheel for safety not having to move your hands and eyes leave the climate controls as dials and switches or levers and no power operated steering column adjustments that add heavy motors that all being said its still a really nice car that i would buybut probably look for someone to modify the doors to some standard fiat door handles
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,nicely done the hondae would get a lot more attention from me if the range was better but for that marque ill hold out for an r spec version with over 250 miles in the meantime this will fill the bill nicely as a runabout
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,well done jonny masterful review with some nice social history thrown in well doen fca too only slightly disappointed that the sherpa setting doesnt enable everest ascents
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,if fca group ever manage to seeing their way to pricing this 15000 after incentives i think it would fly out of the showrooms great little car
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,lovely how the honda e keeps coming up in this review if honda really wanted to sell it they wouldnt have put in it the smallest battery they could find
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thank you for creating this content johnny your enthusiasm for evs is infectious
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the seat mii is the vw eup with a different badge
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,everything is ev or ev conversion on this shitty show un subbed
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i dont like new cars im not in a position to purchase any of the cars but i still sit and watch jonnys reviews the best real life car content maker on youtube in my opinion keep the vids coming
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,that headlight design may well be my favourite ever overall the best looking car ive seen in decades great video jonny
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the 2 battery options is exactly what honda should have done with the e
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,20 000 for a small car like that with a pointless back seat and getting less than 115 miles range is a mockery surely youre better of with a reno zoe
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,french and italian cars have always had a bad reputation for poor electrical reliability can you imagine having a pure ev
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i think it looks awesome but id rather have the honda e for the price
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,ive got the previous generations ev us spec its honestly a fantastic little car it was my gateway drug to evs ive got 3 evs now 500e i3s ipace i still love driving the fiat its just so simple approachable for any driver a quick around town fun little car to mod too ive been slowly turning it into my silent abarth
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the driver of the crz has his windows up because he doesnt want anyone to smell his rollup
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great review johnny awesome car
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,typical ialian flair good range as well could see myself buying one of these you hit it on the head when you said it would attract people who wouldnt normally consider electric i put myself in that category the only downside is italian vehicle electrics reputation
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,another great video jonny thank you stumbled across your channel a couple of weeks back and what a treat its been takes me back to the early days of fifth gearbut with electricity professional informative and entertaining a lot of your fellow youtubers would do well to watch and learn keep up the awesome work
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,what an amazing little ev great very informative review have to admit that i just watched fully charged show 500e review and have to say i am a bit disappointed as much as like like robert you gave me all the information i wanted to know plus more absolutely amazing johnny
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the fact that its electric is excellent otherwise a hateful and contrived crock of shit upvote for the video and the brilliant production and presentation
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,interesting that the long range pack runs at lower voltage i suppose thats a compromise you have to make when youve got a cell you want to use and precious little extra space to stick them
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,this is the best electric small car dont understand why people get excited by the honda fiat is cute but also smart looking minino thanks
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the b pilar looks like an audi a2 do city cars make sense though the aim is to reduce vehicle congestion in cities
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,class video i recognize some of those streets there is a electric go karting place there somewhere
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,love the themed review much more interesting than a run of the mill style review video
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,designed by fiat as an electric vehicle but they still fit it with a button labelled engine start stop and theres all that space under the bonnet where the charging cables could be stored but fiat supply a hand bag to keep the charge cable in the already small boot
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i have morale issues perhaps you guys can help me with that the rational father in me says dont mess up the planet for your son buy an ev the kid in me says go fu off with that crap lets have fun and buy that gr yaris what do you guys say when hearing that
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,nice looking car but a 3 door car in this day and agethink a 4 door version would appeal more
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,bizarre just watched matt watson and now i am seeing digbeth will dmo deejay be drag racing this car and then fighting llf in his mini e for a truly brummie take on evs
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,im not even in the market for an ev and wanted to see this was a fun watch d
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,why do manufacturers make things complicated al those charging options why not just plug it in and unplug it when one needs to go it will have taken a charge the amount dependent on the time plugged in just like ones phone or laptop have they forgotten the kiss principle
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,lol did the car pervert channel get taken down this is a much better name no doubt
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,sorry to go full ev nerd but i think you said it has an 11kw onboard charger but it looks like a single phase type2 when you opened the filler flap which would mean only 72kw capable have they dropped 3phase for the uk model this is something other manufacturers have done as its comparatively rare over here
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the only way to get out of the back of my 500c is to open the roof and step out over the boot but its a great little car shame its twice the price of the petrol original presumably as batteries improve it will come down haha gotta love a cheekycento im keeping that
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,once again we have got to put up up with stupidly oversize wheels on what is basically a city car
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,nice looking little car the presenter was ok too
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i just love the fact that its an italian car thats actually made in italy
2024-01-23,YouTube Comment,superta7it is made in italy though the previous 500 was made in poland but this one is made in turin
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,looking smart the car is good too
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the colours have a special shine and all are beautiful i had a 500c before with a socalled robotic auto transmission and that was awful this new electric one really changed my perception of the 500 but still i am not sure if i want this fake type of convertible roof
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,weve owned a 500 l for several years great car totally reliable however substantially bigger than the 500 proper rear legroom and a big spacious hatch which holds loads of stuff this is too small from the front seats back lovely design though just needs an l
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,production quality smart idea proven korean know how classy italian styling could be a veritable ev 2021 lease hit this 500 e thank you
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,now give us a 124 electric please
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i cant explain itthe honda makes me want to touch and drive it
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,car is an absolute stunner great video
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,didnt expect the look of a fiat 500 to be more fresh than that of a mini and the honda e for me was a disappointment when the design study was so much stronger than the final product the sunroof is a winner for a city car and since almost no one needs 3 seats in this market id put my order on a 500
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,was this review done on a saturday or sunday morning
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,noted the fully charged review of the same car at the same time love the fully charged channel and robert but jonny owned the car review element and still does
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,that was bloody good quality video again dont suppose you could do one everyday could you 😜
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,if theyd fitted sensiblysized wheels the smaller wheel wells would have facilitated better legroom and a larger battery form above functionnn
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,err this isnt realistic is it they dont go all out to put more batteries in evs its a balance between weight price range and performance and looks
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,best review online jonny love the onscreen info panels also the range comparison with the rival cars makes loads on sense
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,its a nice and little cute car until you see it parked near a 4 door sedan and realize its higher and fatter and not little at all
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,a nice thorough review johnny i am disappointed that city cars get bigger all the time id like to see a comparative review of tiny electric cars like the smart etc
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,this makes so much sense as an ev relatively affordable stylish and desirable with a range better than decentlovely
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,at 40k its not affordable at all its another toy and status symbol prop get an opel corsa for 20k fun and range included
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,lonewolfwp9dn actually in italy the price now starts from 16000 with government incentives and i know that in uk fiat 500e will costs starting from 22
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,piergentililuca2905 how can there be such a huge difference what is the government incentive there 20k any way the top models do go to 40k euros its ridiculous for such a small car
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,piergentililuca2905 its just under 20000 i believe for the base model with the government grant
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,davidholden2658 its 10k most other places and 7500 in the uk
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,lonewolfwp9dn what is 7500 in the uk
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,davidholden2658 i just looked it up in the uk the incentive is 8000 pounds thats 8800 euros
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,lonewolfwp9dn no the uk grant is 3000 i dont think its ever been as high as 8000 httpswwwgovukplugincarvangrants
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,davidholden2658 right it used to be 4500 and they cut it its 8k for vans i think for normal cars it used to be higher
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,davidholden2658 there is no such thing as government grants only other peoples money
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,davidholden2658 i like electric cars but at this price and range this is a perfect advertisement for petrol powered cars
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,jamescaley9942 the range is fine for a city car and its only 6000 more than the standard hybrid version with much lower running costs
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,davidholden2658 i was comparing with the 12 petrol much less complicated than the hybrid far superior range than the ev and closer to half the price of the cheapest ev one problem with small battery evs is they will need more charge cycles and that will also reduce battery life and the range is already short true performance will not be as good but this is the budget car class
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,the panda was always the affordable choice not the 500 mkii and further the 500 is a style icon and has also the overpriced style price so now we have to wait how the bread and butter version the panda will do the merger of psa en fca has been aproved so the 500e platform could be used on other small and compact electric cars opelvauxhall karlcorsa citroën c1c3 peugeot 108208 fiat pandapunto and a small chrysler dodge for the us market
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,relatively affordable 40k for a class b car is not affordadle petrol version is like 15k
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,paulomoniz7326 not affordable when you consider the model for selling new cars is the equivalent of taking a mortgage out on a house guaranteed to collapse in value it is a niche for the well of or multicar households and why should tax payers subsidise new car purchases when we cannot even do the same for higher education
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,and spend hours charging it up meanwhile it takes 5 minutes to fill my turbo petrol car up im not against evs but i wont get one until they are a practical direct replacement for diesel and petrol cars same range including winter and same time to charge as filling a tank
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,piergentililuca2905 i am kind of surprised italy feels like paying for your cars
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,tomasmalin go to check it in italy the total discount can reach 10500 with government incentives 6400 scrapping up to 4000 and fiat discounts and i would like to remind you that now euro has more value than pound its one of the reason why you pay more and thats just because of your brexit
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,r3tr0v1ru5 i dont know in uk but in italy and others eu countries an used tesla that costs 20k do not exist ive just checked if it exists its a car ready for the rubbish
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,r3tr0v1ru5 check this video it shows all the costs of fiat 500e in italy and it has english subtitles httpsyoutubex5nbfeoydzu

2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i live in oregon usa and have one of the original es love the car it does exactly what it was designed for commuter but i would absolutely buy one of these with the longer range with the longer range i could realistically drive to and foe airport in winter at freeway speeds without recharging so the big question of the day from us yanks is will it be coming states side
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,hands down the best motoring journalist on the scene at the moment not monitoring hahah johnnys style of presenting is a great mix between facts and quirky banter keep up the great work late brake show

2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great review and i think a fantastic looking car fiat have really got their act together for this one and brave to ditch replacing the current car with another pistonengined one just go entirely ev and accept its the future even if the sales for the next few years might not be great

2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,is this channel the best up and coming car review channel yes it is

2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow thank you your outfit proper suited you my son is of similar build so will work fine hes tried the trench coats which look good on him but sometimes it wasnt practical or got in the way and is now collecting dust yours looks more user friendly of to find it now thanx again
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,electric door openers im out dont even understand how that can be legal yes i am aware that other cars have it too
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,think it looks fantastic it will sell well its the transition car we need for ev adoption can i also add what a fantastic approach to the review tasteful and so different to everything out there which makes it all the more digestible keep it up
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great little car would love one great original presentation
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,small point could you please refer to level 2 adas as driver assistance or similar its not autonomous if it cant drive itself without you needing to take over lv2 constantly requires the driver to be alert and ready to retake control theres a lot of false advertising and undue trust around this tech at the moment and its an important distinction to make
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i think there is only jonny and harry metcalfe doing genuinely original well considered and well produced car content on youtube jonny seems to have found his feet with his channel always good to watch
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,love the review love the setting top marks all round
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,another great video jonny well done i saw on the charts showing recharge times there were these pie charts with clocks on them im not sure what they were trying to show just some feedback thanks again for the great episode
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,not a car for me personally but its nice to see the ev push from old auto manufacturers continue that honda has so much potential why is it being so underkitted a bigger battery pack and a slightly perkier motor and that thing would be 2021 version the 2007 fiat 500
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,jonny fantastic review youve got great charisma and your transition from tv to internet media really shows how great of a car journalist you can be really hope you can get a few sponsors on board shortly you really deserve it i love this channel
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,lovely car and video the fact it has sherpa mode means fiat recognises the ev infrastructure is shyte and will be for years and years to come
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,love the outfit like your namesake vegas on taskmaster 😂 anyway cute car the 500 will always have that i want a cute 2nd car appeal for me its the 500 or the twingo and nothing comes close lookswise to them

2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i watched car wow and fully chrged review of this car yours is best and loved ur dress
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great review i love the story aspect theres enough detail for us geeks and it gives a good impression of what the car is capable of i dont really understand what has happened to small evs over the last few years though the new ones mini honda fiat even the peugeotvauxhall offer numbers similar to a zoe from 3 years ago ok with a little faster charging but for significantly more money they seem to be trying to justify that with styling and tech but it feels like its back to front make a really good platform epanda and then put the premium styledfeatured car at the top of the range for those who care about that sort of thing the zoe is a 10 year old design and thanks to the battery and tech upgrades and ccs its still the best everyday car
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,excellent review and fun as well top work again jonny
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,imagine one day youve messed upyoure driving your 500 ev home on a cold night in sherpa mode but its not enoughthe battery diesbllocks you think to yourself you get out the car on your mobile phone to the rac whilst you grab your bag out the boot you pull the door handle to get back in and the electric touch sensor button doesnt work the boots the same and the keyless fob is insidepoppyck sorry it just bugs me that everything is going electric buttons and screens these days 😂i miss old cars and their manual ways

2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thats a truly sexy car and thats a proper gentleman style johnny hats off to both fiat and your stylist
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i could of shown you all the great sites to eat in digbeth oh well next time call me
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,im not sure i should say this publicly but im kinda addicted to the tlbs i wasnt even thinking ev until i started watching these excellent reviews so that must be a good thing i do want to know however how many watches does jonny have
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,makes you wonder why renault dont just put the zoes internals in an attractive body it would attract so many more customers a modern version of the renault 5 would be great
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,sharp dressed man in spunky little car
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,1345 ive never understood the point of this you still open the door yourself and you still pullpush a handle or button why is it electronic
2021-02-06,YouTube Comment,cost the only reason a car manufacturer does anything
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,although evs continue to interest me we still need them to be doing 500 miles on a charge before they can pull me out of my hybrid lexus
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,bringing your review 6 hours after fullycharged and hitting it out the ballpark hats off johnny
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,just saw an alternative review of this car and it was a dogs dinner you have made a superb job of yours congratulations and thank you
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,your videos get better and better i love it but too small for our family boot and rear seat access yoga hope they produce a giardinetta it wont look as cute but id buy a stretched 500 ev that doesnt look like a 500l ill sign up as a ptreon i hate the marketing abuse of english
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,still dont like electric above petrol but if we have to then it definitely will be this one 😍
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,nice review and actually a lovely looking little thing especially in that colour and trim that is going to do very well most of the people who buy it will just buy one because of the looks
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,jonny taking it to the next level very nice production quality
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,italian electronics control entering and exiting your fiat 500 that will end well 😂
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,1300 long range got 427kwh damn son im sold i can do a trip across europe
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,fiat 500 petrol 11 000 fiat 500 ev 23 000 3500 gov grant 26 500 battery cost for 42 kwh 42 x 120 5040 car should cost 11 000 battery price gove grant 12 500 overpriced enthusiast tax over 10 000 when are we going to start calling out this inflating of prices yes i know its higher trim than the 11 000 petrol version but it doesnt matter when there is no low ev trims available i know rd cost but car relies on already establish platforms also petrol cars also have rd cost this car should be no more than 14 000 after grants we cant be telling people that somehow we will get price party once battery cost drops below 100 we are only 20 away from that 20 reduction in cost will not reduce car price by 10 000 all evidence suggests manufacturers will try to us ev revolution as chance to increase their margins
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i prefer this to the honda e the range is a big big factor after a few years the range of the honda could be less than 100 miles thats simply not good enough considering the price what we really want is the zoe but designed by honda or fiat
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,apart from the car info thanks also for the history lesson
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i really like the colours they chose for this new model i would love a dark green with the same tone
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,this one will probably also sell better 2nd hand than the honda e so all in all it seems to make more sense i wish there was a bigger battery option for the honda it would make decisions so much easier
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,looks great and a brilliant review
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the first of your reviews that i have seen as a prospective ev purchaser albeit maybe not a new car i found the review informative interesting and unbiased as they should be well done i like the car also
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i hate to admit it but i like this new direction for the 500 if the long range can get anywhere near its claimed 199 mile range i think that will be brilliant along with the new corsa e these two manufacturers are actually doing things right and thinking about the bigger picture with a good amount of range unlike these other companies that are bringing out small cars in 2020 that have a claimed range of 100 which in real life is about 7080thats not acceptable imo and limits the overall amount of people that will actually buy one nice video mate
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,another superb feature jonny excellent production values looks fabulous never see enough of lingotto and thanks for setting it in my favourite city
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,im kind of astonished what a fantastic job theyve done on this especially the powertrain and the pricing a properly usable ev for 20k with more range than the 30k leaf of 5 years ago and nearly 200 miles with 85kw charging for 235k thats at the low end of golf pricing and gives some minigunlevel ammunition against the gripe that evs are too expensive particularly surprising that this is coming from fiat they dont have much pedigree with evs if i remember rightly the original 500e compliance car had the powertrain design and engineering done by a third party its also the company formerly headed by famously antiev sergio marchionne who once requested that customers not buy the original 500e the new car is a genuine milestone and its come from a really surprising place
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the alloy wheel design is very stylish like the wrap of materials over the binnacle seats are great nice music and production
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,really good informative review
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,seems to me that range mode would actually reduce your range the regen all the time is less efficient than planning ahead and coasting to a stop without regen
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great review as usual with jonny at his best still dont get 17 inch wheels on a city car which lower the range and worsen the ride the door handles dont bode well for the future when the italian electrics take over i have owned a crz for the last 5 years and can confirm that it is brilliant and will only sell when the honda e prices are affordable second hand
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,very nice now i really want a panda 4x4 electric
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i think you suit the peaky look jonny also the 500e is the first of the new 500s i wouldnt absolutely run a mile from i like the new styling as you say less cutesy perhaps more resting btch face
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,you caught the surfacing and reflections beautifully in the low sun theyve really got the colour right though id like the armani paint job too
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,this was an unbelievably lame video concept idea i absolutely love it never stopx
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,that is a nice little car not sure why the 500s are quite popular in australia so it will be interesting to see how this goes when it gets here
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,they are cheap to buy and run and great fun an ev version should be even better
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,looks so much better than the mini really nice looking and that blue looks a bit like the alfa gabbiano blur colour lovely
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,it looks like a bamix machine for kitchen use i wouldnt drive that thing if i was paid
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i guess in a few years someone will put a regular fire breathing engine in it or at least thats what im hoping will happen
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,to think i go on drives through digbeth in my old mini nice to see the area get some screen time
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i saw one of the california only 500s at ikea in the algarve last week still had the california plate fixed underneath its new portuguese plate dragged my partner across the car park to show her something unique and rare that she wouldnt appreciate shes used to it now
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i saw one of the california only 500s at ikea in the algarve last week still had the california plate fixed underneath its new portuguese plate dragged my partner across the car park to show her something unique and rare that she wouldnt appreciate shes used to it now
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,fiat always smash it with styling love my abarth 124 spider
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,hi johnny its actually a really good verdict in the sense it as you said gives you more choice which can only be a good thing what is needed now with each of these cars dealerships is to get them on there loan fleet so when you take your piston engine car in for service you get to drive one without any sales pressure and i am sure more people would consider one once they have tried one
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,for me its definately the most exciting car in its class just ahead of the honda e with range being the big plus for the 500 as a very straight man id actually love one for city driving
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the ncap rating in 2017 was three stars even a smart fortwo scores four back in 2007
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,smarts are some of the safest cars on the road when i tell people that they never believe me
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,price jonny price jonny price jonny price jonny ffs 10 minutes in 🙄 good review tho glad youve dropped the aka car pervert nice fast show reference too
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow yes dear but when youre putting stats on screen for city and long range price should be one of them x
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,nickprice3605 ill add the price for nick price sooner on the next video sorry nick price price
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,they have really nailed this one well done fiat
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,its amazing what a car company can do when an old fart never electric dies
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,this is just like the honda e a car that appeals to you because of its styling although im not sure about the fascia i like the 2007 fascia of the 500 better rationally speaking it probably wouldnt be an option but humans arent rational
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,cant see me getting a ev am 33 years old grow up wanting performance and a car it sounds like one these are boring
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,another good review by our very own car expert jonny smith unfortunately i will not be buying an electric car anytime soon cos i live on a island i could not tell you where the hell is any car charging points saying that when we do finally catch up with the rest of the country then i would certainly be looking at purchasing a fiat 500
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,when fca commits to building something proper they can deliver something truly interesting and good looking just wish they would do it more often maybe they should look at jonny for some inspiration his commitment results in something that is interesting different and goodlooking maybe they need some car pervert espresso cups
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,an electric car made in italy thatll work well
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,sergio marchionne never would have let this car happen his passing enabled fiat to begin bringing italian style to evs hopefully something similar is in development for the chrysler side of fca
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,if ever a car had to be ev its a 500 love the design sorprendente just like the video and editing jonny im loving the reviews on evs as its something i will look to get in a few years my only concern is will the charge on these cars diminish similar to my mobile laptop tablet after a years worth of charging
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,good question ev batteries have a lot more systems in place such as clever heat management to protect them from degradation unlike laptop and phone batteries i would suggest watching a video or two from plug life tv the excellent euan mcturk explains this is detail httpsyoutubeqrpze4f0gsq
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,marktaylorhankins9398 thanks just watched that now and hes helped to dispel a lot of the gumf ive heard of regarding charging and battery lifespans
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,20 grand for a 200 mile electric city car with a second slower 060 will this be our midlife crisis car on finance when were all single virgins and stuck in our pod share with 12 other sweaty ev car owners in central london probably
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great technical review this is why we watch you jonny watched another review from a wellknown channel just before this hands down this is the more informative review
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,id pick the 500e over any electric car he mentioned for one simple reason its italian
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,elukok i see it as an absolute win
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,a great review looks great funny and informative b i love that you basically called this the impossible burger of small cars c no mention of the electric corsa the comparison charts were great id love to have those for more categories
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,hi roy great observations corsa yes of course and c4e i am yet to review these cars properly but they are definite considerations albeit a larger segment car
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow ohohoho i didnt realize there was a c4e as well this is such a fun segment right now manufacturers are really trying stuff out and some of it is so weird and cool
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow nono you were already going for the peaky blinders thing which was brilliant and we shouldnt mix metaphors
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,robert wont appreciate me saying this jonny but your review is way more in depth and a much better review this looks like a very well thought out car whenever i here the word sherpa i think of the old van too 😄 i must say the headlight design is bloody lovely
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i loved the 500 when it was reborn ive always liked it as it never had a redesign that was major i dont like this one though
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,in general the aesthetics is somewhat debatable it depends on the taste of each one it may be that in the honda you find very advanced engineering or in renault a very practical and spacious car however so far i have not seen another electric car that removes that air of an electric vehicle lacking in grace and style as if it had been made by a computer manufacturer the only fiat 500 rival that strays from that concept of hardware on wheels is the mini but the mini lacks the flair of italian designers renowned throughout the world we are talking about a beautiful design reminiscent of its past something that mini lost but according to what is required from now on beautiful car ahhh and the melody of fellinis dolce vitta is an insurmountable touch when starting the vehicle transports you to italy after wwii
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,jonny my boy you did it music camera whole style this is really good cinema and the car is also nice
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great review dude soo much better than roberts on fully charged😲 car is still too small effectively its a 2 seater or at best a 22 surprised you didnt make more of that in the vid seems very important to me
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,terrific vid stunning car it makes the mini look at least 3 years old and outdated rather than 3 months and whilst the honda e is a charming work of genius its flawed and expensive this is neither car of the year for me by a huge margin cheers
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,at least the top of the range model has a decent range jonny your ex fully charged partner has just reviewed a fiat 500e too
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,range is soo demonised last night my wife asked me if she can safely go to work in our i3 coz the battery is at 46 which the app says is good for 60km the temp is around freezing that is 10x her round trip to work and kindergarten weve had the car for 2 months now so we are still learning usually we juice up once a week just to keep the battery in 5080 zone out of 34 cars you mentioned my moneyd be spent on the mini its the most mature vehicle here the cars been perfected for 20 years and the powertrain for 7 and it drives better than mini jcw which i tested it back to back with
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,italian electrics what could possible go wrong
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,ive watched this post fullycharged both great videos i can tell you put a lot of effort into this i will always watch an electric car review also i live in birmingham and know those streets thanks
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,an electric fiatlets see how long this will last haha
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,nice swag great looking car too well rounded design that keeps he spirit of the original
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,only electric powered what a very sad day for motoring
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,it would be interesting to see on electric cars not just the 060 but its 010 020 030 etc
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,030 is the sweet spot on cars like this
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow well my friend put your money where your mouth is and start doing some 010 to 20 for everyone please
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,pleased you mentioned peaky blinders id have thought it was a norman wisdom themed review otherwise i like the car but evs need to lose a few pounds before i buy another in terms or price and weight
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,pity not rwd like original 500 could be done with electric motor
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the late brake show is my favourite show at the moment on any platform high production quality interesting topics and johnny youre a ledge keep up the good work

2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,im 6foot 2 drive a bmw x5 but i like this fiat 500
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,ooooh how close to 200k subscribers you hitting refresh every 5 minutes jonny 😉
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,only drove a 500 once as hire from rome to positano that was not a pleasant experience the car was utterly useless small underpowered engine clunky automatic transmission i have no doubt this electric version is better in every way but i would never buy a 500
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,lovely little car
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,they prolonged ev subsidies in germany recently they might decide to make some more eup
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,ok johnny i am officially bored shitless of ev nowgo do some hydrogen fuel cell cars instead buddy that is where the real future is
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,ha piston vids coming soon hydrogen passenger cars good luck with that
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow no movement on the tech yet i remember when i was a kid in the 80s jonny ford were on tomorrows world saying they were close why the sudden change of tune i really like a lot of these evs but i just dont see them as the way forward or sustainablejust moves the problem to another place hydrogen on the other handbtw that defender was awesome best of the lot so far imho
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great review the effort you put into this film really shows im not sold on evs because of the dodgy charge network and the lack of confidence and convenience they still display give me a car with 250 miles of range and an 80 charge in under 15 minutes and then i might be convinced the design of the car is truly italian and is a lovely package but can it match its japanese competitors for reliability and quality
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,unfortunately its a fiat it will break down
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the fiat 500e ev wins the most yt reviewed car of the week award but you win the best review for information and entertainment imho thanks
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i thought sherpa van to like the design of the new 500
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,yet another overpriced car incapable of delivering on the ev promise pay the earth for them find their range is nowhere near the manufacturers claims and on top of that monthly charges for battery hire struggle to find anywhere to charge it etc etc etc i purchased my peugeot 106 diesel 4 years ago for 500 it is worth more now and i get 80mpg out of it it wont be going anywhere soon
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,im out sorry no more ev crap

2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow thank you
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great review honest and to the point funny and emotional lovely car look forward to seeing them on the road prices keep creeping down
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,id say i prefer this to the honda e fiat
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i would say this is a more balanced city car than the honda e and the mini without being barebone as the zoe is does that make it better no its just different and thats great because it draws in more people theres now such a great choice of city cars in the ev world that its really hard not to find something you like and that fits your needs the only problem stays in the price but i guess well need time for that
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,got to say your review was really well detailed compared to fully charged
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,ive just watched them both back to back and have learnt many times more about the car from tlbs than fc
2020-12-11,YouTube Comment,well jonny is a professional car reviewer
2020-12-11,YouTube Comment,snakeyuk08 as more of the same car reviews come from both fc and tlbs that is becoming painfully obvious
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i would get a mini electric
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,though your review is good the car itself i find it not appealing as its too expensive
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,nice review jonny
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thats a good old fun top what an undeniably brilliant looking little car id have one

2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i have one in soon but might just do social media on it as an ev it seems pretty weak but i could be wrong
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow no worse then the honda e or this 500 but has a usable trunk and okay backseats at least compared to the honda and fiat ha
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great video and a smart little car

2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great review jonny great production
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i have a crz and i want to move to a honda e but i just cant the range is too poor
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow my crz represents pretty much everything i enjoy in a car and i really really like it but strangely i dont love it in fact given current usage i would swap it for a new citroen ami electric in a heartbeat if i could
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,love the styling and nearly 200 mile range well done fiat just need a fiat panda poverty spec ev under 15 grand
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,im really really waiting for a proper panda ev hope fiat gets their shit together
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,briandowling8372 it could be a really cool car i really hope fca can get through it theyve looked a bit lost and out of touch with their origins lately id really like to have speedy small evs with the compromise between practicality style and that touch of sympathy than only fiat had
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,donkeymarco that would be very wise of them the centoventi singlehandedly restored my faith in the fiat brand and it would be a shame if it remained a concept forever but i have a feeling they were serious when they presented it
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,200 mile range 4x4 panda would be awesome
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,spruce1509 yes that would be awesome a simple light electric 4x4
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,for 2022 fiat panda 120 style ev is in work
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,in italy the basic 27 kwatt is priced 15k euros governament give 8k euros for ev and 20k for the more range version
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,very professional film beautiful car lovely music very informative lots of comparative data with its rivals much better than top gear or the grand tour i would buy one for sure
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,you are not driving the la prima your test car is the icon version la prima has white fauleather seats
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow ok suggest taking look at the fiat website have the la prima on reserve
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the turning off sound amused me more far more than it should i think vets should have that on standby next time your in there to have a pet put to sleep
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,in five years time people will still be admiring the fiat that was possibly your best video yet jonny an absolute masterpiece
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,cool video but just lacking his extra ussal design detailscar wow site goes a little bit extra
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,special credits to the costume department very appropriate for the location and matching the italian car design
2020-12-05,YouTube Comment,in 5 years time no more petrol cars not even hybrids all due to imbecile politicians from eu euro 7 and uk outright ban fu2025
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,right that was a peculiar run can we go back to petrol cars now please as in you know petrol head
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow 3rd ev video within 2 weeks love your content but the ev thing is a bit much i get ppl like them so channels do have to cover them but what i miss and is a bit unfair imo is ppl never show the time they spent charging the thing and never seem to mention how these cars will depreciate in value when a better batteryquicker chargingmuch longer range evs inevitably come to market i guess id rather celebrate tech thats mature and exciting thats just me though anyways keep up the good work
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,is it just me or does the face of the front end look like the leonardo dicaprio meme same expression of furrowed brow and smug smile lol
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i believe they based it on him yes
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,if the 500e car is as good as your video production then it is worth looking at
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,jonny is honestly one of the few that has gone from traditional media to social media and is really good at it may it be reviews like this one indepth geeky videos updates on his personal fleet or anything involving richard porter its always enjoyable
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i have pinned this not because i necessarily believe it to be true but in the hope that a brand will see the light and sponsor the channel thanks
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow i cant believe you dont have a sponsor yet are people mental this channel will be going places with its amazing and very well shot content you were born to do this jonny with you calm yet very witty and knowledgable style
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow i really hope that happens for you and most importantly you get to retain creative control
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i agree the thing that really makes the channel watchable for me is that jonny hasnt put him self in any of the more traditional motoring tribes hes not ev or nothing and hes not grrr petrol i know if i click on a lake brake show video it will be a well researched to the point that he isnt afraid to read from a little notebook well thought out and very nicely filmed his passion for all things car related comes across in every video without having to be in your face shouty
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,well said hes taken on board helpful constructive criticism and moved the show on professionally im signing up as a paid subscriber i just cant stand the word ptreon even though i just said it
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow love your casual approach and natural presenting style jonny detailed and entertaining hope you find a sponsor that fits with your brand and ethos
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow well it is true jonny and the key is that youre focused on the topics rather than on trying to be a presenter which is what most youtube car folk seem to concentrate on alas you have the advantage of being a naturally excellent presenter of course
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,his mrs is even funniersorry johnny
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,totally in agreement fullychargedshows review is a complete joke compared to this one
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,if we start a petition to get jonny sponsorship and just over half the people who watch this channel sign it they have to debate it in parliament that will get some attention dont you think come on people in fact i will i just started it httpspetitionparliamentukpetitions562716sponsorsnewtokenjv0l0n3xdg1sjywg_du0
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,its a really solid review and a pleasure to watch it leaves the fully charged review of the same car so far behind in the dust no offense meant to robert but their reviews are just not at this level of writing and production thanks for bringing the quality
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,hard to argue with this even when i dont love the car being featured its always interesting
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,paolo bernasconi i wonder if this may help you for context im in australia your experience may be different i no longer use the app to watch yt i use firefox instead i only get one advert at the start of each clip and occasionally one in the middle on the app yt was simply unwatchable and with what i reckon will be the everupward trajectory of jonnys show it will only get worse if my understanding is correct however its important to realise that the number and frequency of adverts is nothing to do with the particular channel youre viewing ie not jonnys fault or within his control
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow you should have more confidence in yourself jonny youre a great presenter and are one of my favourite car people in the last 10 years right up there with harris and needell youve a level of knowledge and professionalism that far exceeds influencers whove largely bought their way into youtube success by having rich daddys who can indulge their expensive habits each to their own but its not something i remotely care about or want to watch i also dont like people who play for the camera which a lot of influencers do youre just far more natural at this ive also enjoyed you bringing your wife into some of the recent videos too its obvious how much you care about her and i bet you troll each other constantly keep up the great work mate
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,action cant be the small battery becuase its going to be so less active
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow epic presented as ever and really nice filming and editing real quality
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow if thats the direction you wish to go you need to stop using the term car pervert it maybe apt but it will leave many corporate types cold but you probably already know that also comparing bobbyllews figures for a much younger channel your figures are looking far healthier
2020-12-04,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow a brand called netflix would be excellent
2020-12-14,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow way more relatable and engaging than mat lets drag race teslas everyday watson
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i think honestly johnny leaned on the whole peaky blinders thing way too heavily particularly with that backing music just wasnt doing it for me apart from that cracking car awesome review and thoughts on it informative and honest the renault zoe and the honda e would be the top contenders in my opinion people who buy a 500 want the easy driving and high style factor like the mini or the honda e potentially
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,honda e and fiat 500 makes the electric cars sexy for me
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the technology for these cars is brilliant my concerns are the batteries as good as the technology in the cars or will they like a ageing phone start losing charge quickly as they get older and charging points the governmentlocal authorities say they are going to put charging points basically everywhere but these are the same governmentlocal authorities that cant even fill potholes in our roads and more importantly the price of these electric cars that alone rules me out to ever buy one
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,did you change the channel name from car pervert
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow i agree with the change i never liked the name but always enjoyed the content
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,pretty cool would love to see vw do an ev beetle
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,top review mate that startupshutdown sound is dreadful i want mine to sound like the batmobile
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow yeah i found that just now its pretty cool those noises must be hackable id have thought i wish my golf gte did that
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,why must they constantly make all the small cars bigger each generation soon all the small cars will be the size of range rovers
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,because safety and comfort require thicker and thicker outer shells which if the outside didnt get bigger the interior would get smaller nobody wants to sit in a tin can even if the outside is nice and small
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,unfortunately they need the floorpan to be big enough in area for a decent sized battery pack
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,not a fan of those door handles unless theres a hidden lever or something if the accessory battery goes dead which is an alarmingly common problem on evs you have no way to get into the car meaning theres no way to get access to the 12v accessory battery to jump startrecharge it
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the ev reviews by mr smith are so detailed its hard not to fall in love with a car he rates
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,yes jonnys reviews are way better than lots of other yt videos
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,italian electrics what can go wrong
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,excellent review one thing didnt the recent 500 abarth have a 17 wheel option
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,fiat will tell you that isnt a 500
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow fair enough
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,does any of the car manufacturers have the guts to push their base models for reviews
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i love a base model but on first launch it is nigh on impossible to get access to them
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the quality of this review is astonishing thank you johnny
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the zoe is great on paper but everytime i see one or try to see myself in it i get depressed and feel sick its just so drab and ugly with lazy styling and a cheap feel
2020-12-13,YouTube Comment,i have the 2017 500c abarth and i was considering what electric car i would buy in addition to my abarth the only electric option that speaks to me in the us is the tesla for its performance but if there was an abarth version of the 500e i would do everything to get it in the us
2020-12-21,YouTube Comment,mini e looks to be the most sporty small ev at the moment would love to see an abarth version of the 500e
2021-12-01,YouTube Comment,eggegg2873 mini e is not small it wont fit in my garage unlike my 2002 r53 cooper s which does fit im sick and tired of each model revision of a car being bigger than the previous one
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,looks much nicer than the zoe clear italian style great review
2020-12-12,YouTube Comment,zoe is in a different class of size and it competes in pricequality fiat doesnt make sense beyond the cute looks
2021-05-02,YouTube Comment,uhohumm the zoe only has a better autonomy a field in which the 500 e is eventually 2nd in the quality and technology the fiat is better also because it came out later talking about the design the 500e is definitely better
2022-04-07,YouTube Comment,looks nice but only second car if wanted long range no or minimal breaks on journey id leave it at home about only ev id consider
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,very stylish review thanks for your honesty
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,yeah yeah i come from the west country cant hide my accent at times like that
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow dont mind me im just jealous
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,lovely car poor old digbeth needs an upgrade
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,shame they got rid of the red fiat badge
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,what a great review i own an outgoing 500 abarth and this captures the essence of the previous models design very well for the likes of young couples etc the range of evs is now big enough to give enough choice for people looking for a main family car at a reasonable price the 500e wins on styling for me bit of an audi a1style rear end with the tail lights as well
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,nice car fantastic episode just love the styling photo and combined story telling
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,fiat automatic door handles uh oh
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,this is a cool little car its a pity that the car as you reviewed it will be insanely expensive in ireland so not many will buy it most cars in ireland are usually bought with trim levels that wouldnt be out of place in rural india and the owners usually end up driving around in a low spec car that would make the designers cringe
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the original 500e was only sold in those places because they were the only places that had mass electric charging at the time and a high enough of eco friendly people
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,what a great little car lovely italian style and by the way the cap suits you
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,if the honda kept its original show car design that would be a close call id take this in a heartbeat what a beautiful little machine
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great videos top quality really great to see the growing market for ev options and also the different batterymotor specs for different markets thats the way it should be no need for a lot of power and battery if your car lives inside a city or m25 more to buy more to carry round more environmental impact
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,but higher starting price than mini and fiat
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,ive just watched fully charged review on this and you and robert have similar views on it
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,there seems to be a lot of comments from those that still look at the up front cost of an ev versus petroldiesel options ive ran a zoe for 18 months at a fraction of the cost of buying a second hand iced car ive done all the things you arent supposed to be able to do commuting 56 miles a day regular trips from torquay to heathrow luton and stanstead airports usually covered between 1500 and 1800 miles a month i cant charge at home or at work far quieter and smoother than it should be for its size and unlike your average small hatch you cant be bullied in traffic as you are with a small ice hatch this fiat is top of my list and liking the 11kw ac very useful oh i know have an electric van and electric motorbike im not wealthy i just take more notice of the advantages of evs than most im a mv tech so can keep old ice stuff on the road cheaper than most but the running costs of evs and very low maintenance is unbeatable the infrastructure needs to be better but it is getting better very quickly now
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,a really valuable testimonial doug thank you like you i try to explain the cost of ownership of evs to people as being a fraction of piston cars people often dont look beyond the initial windscreen price
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,hi jonny i think this car i believe deserves more attention than just talking about all the time of its rivals shame i think especially because otherwise i use to like your videos in my sight it ruins your unbiased image of you
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow thanks for reacting on it i dont want to be troll i just feel this car deserves more detailed attention than to showing that much of its rivals however i know its your opinion and not mine
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,fiat 500e with 500km range one can dream right
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,tidy little car executed well the key issue is still the same though if you live in a high rise in london or a tenement flat in glasgow where the hell are you gonna charge it
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,most people in london dont own cars theyve got nowhere to park them and london has a good public transport network
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the renault zoe seems better in every single category
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,very interesting video myself i have electric seat and my dream is to have ev fiat i thought i will share where i found good quality and affordable ev cables compared with other companies this one the best httpsevchargepluscom
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,42kwh battery is less than 5 grand put in a cheap metal car 30k for you sir lol
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i love it i hope mini follow suit with a small ev
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,gtfo are you serious the note 7 was a disaster yes but samsung is a giant battery supplier just like lg
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,or spend slightly more and get a real electric car a tesla
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,very cool review thanks a lot loved it bella cinematografia
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,just buy the twin air 2 cylinder rather than waste your money on an over priced tiny car with a small battery
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the battery isnt that small i love the twin air but its economy claims are smoke and mirrors
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i drove the original 500e and it was amazing theyve nailed this imo better than the hondae
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,this model 3 and a leaf make total sense as electric options if it is 99 recyclable and avoids traditional italian electrical issues then im all for it way better than the huge electric suvs
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,way too expensive lithium cells are 150 kwh this should be less than 20k its only 42kwh
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the problem isnt really the batteries but all the new hardware around it plus the software required the first models are always more expensive
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,alanmay7929 dont waste your time mr williams is a regular troll
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,windows up for smoking too thats full commitment to the cause what a fucking legend
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,two things they missed the chance to make it rear engined rwd would be a fun little beast second now that they porduce them in italy does this mean the quality is going to be even worse d
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,yeah rwd like the original and yet cars like the honda e is rwd strange huh
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow maybe for room i just think it is a missed oppertunity
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,what a stunning little car
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,it is but while i can still pick up a mint 2 year old bmw m140i for less money i intend to do so one day it wont be an option and this stunning little car and its ilk will be the only choice youll have ill enjoy it when the time comes but im not done enjoying the rare treats we already have on the menu
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,darknewt9959 well said just bought an 18month 335d fully loaded for 20k euro6 clean as and goes very well indeed thank you until these over priced milf floats come down in price i think i will leave these and trinkets for the middle classes to buy and pretend they are making a difference
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,rogernewton7831 hahahaha i never noticed however i shall leave it as is
2020-12-08,YouTube Comment,darknewt9959 well you can always pick up a used car for a lot less than a new one in the same way i could say no a nmw m140i is a bad option because there is a 8 year old mercedes c 180d for the same price tag
2020-12-08,YouTube Comment,mell3109 you expect a new car to compete with used ones which is nonsense for electric and for gas cars
2020-12-08,YouTube Comment,ismalith i expect value for money and a quality level to match the price tag
2020-12-08,YouTube Comment,ismalith nonsense a 2 year old car has plenty of life in it a typical 8 year old car is half way to the wreckers yard
2020-12-08,YouTube Comment,darknewt9959 a well maintained 8 year old car can easily outlive a 2 year old car on the other hand a new fiat 500e will outlive both by at least a decade as long as fiat didnt allow themselves a big blunder or you crash it the point is newer cars always cost more than older used ones as long as you are in the regular car marked what you choose depends on what you want some wnat up to date technology and the feel that a car is their car so they pay the new price tag others dont care for that and are well off with used cars i personally would always prefer the luxury of an electric drive train over a unreliable and problemativ gas drive train so for me a 2 year old bmw 1 series wont be the better deal that doesnt say anything about the two cars also a new bmw 1 series costs around 35000 where i live and the fiat 500 36000 without subsidy so the fiat 500 is definitely not that expensive
2020-12-08,YouTube Comment,mell3109 you know that this are just empty words right what is value for you and what price tag maches what quality level and bmw is not exactly know for building exceptional reliable cars i would definetly argue that qualityprice wise you would be better of with a vauxall or opel astra than a bmw 1 since the quality advantage of bmw vs the astras is marginal at best and definitely not two times as high also we do not know how well fiat build that 500 given the high reliability of electric drive trains it isnt a long shot to assume that the fiat might actually be able to outlive two bmw 1 series for an over all price tag that is lower than one
2020-12-08,YouTube Comment,ismalith value is the perceived level of good for the cash quality is will it fall to bits fiat isnt exactly know for quality products if its quality discussion measure against japan and their products however i cant accept that a tiny car it being traded for twice the money of a petrol vauxhall when it will only last max 10 years the petrol version is able to last a lot longer i have a 48 year old jensen interceptor the carbon used to manufacture it has long been forgotten about so to total carbon footprint is tiny compared to this have a look at harrys garage where he goes through the figures interesting watch i agree we need technical solutions to overcome the current problems but this is not the solution i made this the other day tell me how this is going to work
2020-12-08,YouTube Comment,mell3109 why do you assume that the gas 500 will last longer or any gas engine for that matter gas engines have usualyl very low life spans with around 200000km reliable and why do you assume that the carbon footprint of manufacturing is high vauxhalls last at least 20 years usually 30 with a bit care that is just as long as bmws last also your jenson has gas mileages that you turn your key once and you got more than this fiat 500 on 1000 miles
2020-12-08,YouTube Comment,ismalith the batteries will not go past 10 years the petrol car can last a lot longer the carbon production per unit the electric is far higher unfortunately re the jensen it only does about 1000 miles per year although mpg is poor it is still hugely better than electric as the manufacturing footprint is so low as we are almost 50 years in the car in its lifetime has only done 50k miles if you go like for like you would need to buy 5 electric cars over the same period its not even close factor in that infrastructure is not doable to account for the transport needs then this is a dud in the uk there are 40million cars in the uk the muppets who are in charge who obviously cant do basic maths how stated that not only will they prevent fossil fuel transport but 2030 but the strategy will be based around electric im baffled have a look at this this type of housing is typical in the uk how do we put in an infrastructure to cope with this charging will have to be done away from the home so we will have churching parks in the middle of retail parks what if you just want to charge it
2020-12-24,YouTube Comment,this fiat 500 is awesome and classy
2021-01-25,YouTube Comment,bohemianphotographer6843 it reacts better than whatever garbage you are driving costs less and doesnt sound like broken shaver
2021-01-25,YouTube Comment,ismalith of course you know what im driving go to sleep mate you need it 😂
2021-01-25,YouTube Comment,one of the best looking city cars and excellent value for money compared to other electric cars fiat has always been excellent for mini cars
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i think your best work yet good honest evaluation of an awesome looking fiat
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,why does the i3 get excluded from everyones comparisons
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,simply because of price the i3 is awesome and i rate it hugely but these cars start in the early 20k
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great review my dream car would be an electric fiat panda cross fingers crossed theyll make it sometime in the near future
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,id love to get my mk2 retrofitted great little car
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,45 mkwh is great i dig the facelift and the figaro rolltop convertible another italian reference lol also just realized that the eyebrow lights mimic the split 0s in the 500 logo which is a cool design touch and those manholecover wheels are kinda groovy too
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,if you like brum accent watch car wow utube site videosand a little more detail but still the laughs
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,this review is so well produced and presented streets ahead apologies 😂🙏 car is a real achievement stylistically and conceptually
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,not sure how those vw electric vehicles can be compared with this italian beauty sans front grill
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,most probably fiat500e will compete in city car ice segment together with honda e as john stated while vw is competing in its own bigger category no new ev is going to steal sales from each other but rather from ice versions that is great since lets face it the choice range in ev is far less than in ice world for now so the more ev choices the better and by the way despite drone views for this car made in california for its commercials online the car itself will not be available for sale in north america unfortunately so no global audience for now sadly
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,ffix iit aagain ttomorrow the italians invented the electrical fault
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,when was the last time youve owned a fiat
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,tacodias i was in love with fiat over the years and you grin and bear little problems over the years then you wake up and realize theres better cars out there
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,superb review as always jonny
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,do you review cars that arent electric
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,yes usually the content is 5050 but lots of ev launches lately i have cool piston things coming
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,nice outfit nice car
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,im straight from robs review i think its a little pricey and a little bit short on seats needs to be 4 seat great package though with the setup it has a 22 drophead could have been possible a real drophead coupe like the 124 sport coupe only a bit lifted and fatter
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,you reviewing cars like the honda e and 500e so early will bring an avalanche of new viewers
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,will you be doing a review of the new citroen ec4 when it comes out
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the 500e looks better than all the other small evs in my opinion that is the only car that could tempt me out of my petrol car however it is a bit of a bloater compared to the petrol 500 it looks like it has been locked up in a pie shop for a few weeks
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,excellent video just watched full charged video and i honestly think yours is much better not saying robert did a bad job bravo keep up the great videos
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,came here to say exactly the same thing so much more information but without it becoming a power point show great work
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,robert just blathers gave up watching him months ago his spiel never varies and hes boring johnny is streets ahead in all respects
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the renault zoe seems to be the best choice that nobody wants they win like every test in the magazines yet i havent even seen one in the wild
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,ive seen a lot here in devon but hard to spot the latest 50kw model over the 22 and 40 unless you know what to look for
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,they are all over the place here in stockholm even more common than model 3
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i agree the zoe is an awesome car i love the latest iteration but yet it is so often forgotten no idea why
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,and im still here waiting for the first 4x4 overland electric vehicle
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,sidowse if theyll ever deliver probably not
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i have to say of all the small ev cars the fiat is head and shoulders above from a style point of view good review
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,honda still looks way better than this fiat
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,alanmay7929 i love the honda e probably more than the 500e but is it way better stylistically i tend to like the honda e a little bit more but i can totally see how someone might like the fiat more the inside of the honda e is a bit cooler and funkier the inside of the fiat maybe a little bit more stylish the outside of the fiat is more elegant and cuter whilst the outside of the honda is more interesting modern both great cars really
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,ewadge the 500e seems to be in sort of a middle ground stylish but not too fancy although it looks good its not a fridge range and ev stuff pretty good but not excelent and for an attractive price i think fiat here got the best compromise
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,its as though fiat has remembered oh wait were the best at making small cars
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,reddsoldier lol they do that sometimes
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,reddsoldier hope they make it i like fiat despite all the hate they get
2021-10-03,YouTube Comment,ilpatongi same here not even close
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great review jonny as always balanced informative unbiased and entertaining thanks
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,that looks to be a great little car range slightly better than my existing 120ah bmw i3s which does us just fine as a daily driver on y 130miles a day commute should be cheaper to lease too if slower possibly not as capable dynamically
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,you can get an 18 month old 500 for under 10k the prices dont stack up
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,last gen is not electric not really comparable
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,kidoctane thats true but the arbath edition 500 was the top of the line limited edition not focused at the wider small car market the electric 500 here is focused at the wider small car market so when the base model costs almost as much as as an arbath then questions need to be asked about what youre getting in return
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,mylesclark1757 hum the abarth 500595695 is a somewhat of a mainstream version there have been some limited edition versions like the outrageously priced biposto although not a huge seller its been a consistent seller for over 10 years my point is that while the 500e is undoubtedly pricey now there are ppl who will pay that sort of money for an interesting small car it is early days for the ev market so all ev cars are pricey the 500e seems competitively priced against its opposition i expect that over time that ev car prices will reduce as numbers increase and they become more mainstream me assuming that the 500e is released in my country australia and its priced comparable to an abarth hello and take my
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great camera work in the opening sequence nice car congrats on not getting stabbed in the face
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,everything you can like on the styling is just something only the italians can manage those wheels 😍
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,stevetaylor7650 dont think i have only seen the 31 and these
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great review great car
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,actually an excellent video the main stream manufacturers are getting their act together finally focusing on the smaller size cars yes honda are the first with a new design whilst mini and fiat want to maintain the heritage links it will be interesting to see if mini actually pursue the recent published concept a smaller three door a crossover and larger countryman ev based
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,yeah that front grill looks gaudy with that 500 on it not very italian at all thats a shame for an otherwise good looking car
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,and holy hell they are still using those fiat parts bin electric window switches the same ones that ruin the interior of the alfa 159 giulietta brera and 4c unbelievable fiat couldnt grab anything from the giulia eh
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,jonny i think your decision to diversify your own channel has been a great success you never know what kind of vehicle your going to get from week to week keeps it spicy 😅 loving the production these days too
2020-12-03,YouTube Comment,thelatebrakeshow in the menswear business we call them vests but to the customers we call them waistcoats
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,an excellent video jonny which shows that in terms of city cars at least there is now a good selection of quality and interesting options
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,yeah those crzs would be so sick as a bev
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,hmm cleaver electronic door handles and an italian car what could possibly go wrong 😂😂😂😂
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,agreed highlevel quality and tasteful execution very pleasant to watch
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,bobbylew just beat you to it with an hour or so but nice with different views on the same car 😎
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,yeah iconic design like the honda e maybe the 2nd gen of both cars will get more affordable
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,please dont focus just on electric carit seems that nowadaysnot because i hate it becuase it is expensive to most people
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,cheeky little car good looking i dont get the whole interest in electric cars its not the future its not sustainable from start to end and its not green i get it for small one off specials but mass production with the issue of supply in the metals required for the batteries it doesnt work why are we supporting the chinese as this is where the the batteries are produced why arent we supporting hydrogen fuel cell technology which is where the uk come in infinitely more sustainable and much more green in essence we are supporting the wrong technology as a race
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,you do realize that fuel cells have even more exotic and expensive materials than batteries and hfcevs still have batteries anyway and that the losses just never work out why throw away half of the energy you produce for an expensive difficult storage medium how is that green
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,patreekotime4578 i do realise they have exotic materials however they are in far more plentiful supply than those used in batteries there are presently only 3 countries able to mine the metals for batteries and if a country the size of wales decided tomorrow that only battery cars were to be used 3 million people one of those countries producing these metals would dry up completely the other aspect from an environmental perspective is where do these batteries go at end of life in the uk ineos is already producing 350 thousand tonnes of hydrogen a year and have signed a deal with kia to get things moving we then come on to charging electric cars how can people in terrace houses charge them do we leave cables running over pavements sidewalks for people to trip over we already have a ready made infrastructure for dispensing hydrogen they are called petrol stations gas stations safety is no less than that of battery cars the car richard hammond crashed rimac took three days to extinguish the fire due to all the cells combusting in a chain reaction then we come into the shipping of the metals from various countries to china heavy fuel oil at least in europe we have mgo marine gas oil which a more highly refined fuel emitting less fumes china are not yet interested in lowering emissions oh and by the way the uk national grid electricity is already running at 95 capacity the only reason this is all going ahead is due to government the same was true of diesel engines and look where that got us solved the o zone but gave more people is cities breathing problems now they are taxing us out of diesel into another white elephant
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,nice city runabout
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,as an american i feel like this is too late the last 500 series was blasted with quality issues due to the new mexico plant and the car is back its euro only roots so its great its updated but ill never get to drive it
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,when are there gonna be electric cars for less than 20k so far all these cars are well outside my price range
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,technically the 500 already is 1114 but i think the same at the moment evs seem to be a good secondary car but cost more than your main car which is exaggerated by the fact that there is only a questionable used car market for evs so in my mind i compare new ev prizing with preowned petrol cars
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,someone needs to make a car under 20k theres a huge huge market for that
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,scottpc exactly i dont need all these fancy screens and stuff just give me a reliable ev with decent range and the ability to rapid charge for less than 20k
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,the problem is evs dont scale in capability with ice vehicles because a 10 gallon fuel tank only cost the manufacturer a few hundred bucks and fills just as fast and has 300 miles range even in a 14k car but the battery alone to have 300 mile range cost more than 14k and it will take longer to fill to 300 miles range
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,elkott unfortunately there seems to be an expectation for every car to have highly advanced safety and self driving to some extent regardless of size thats pushing the price of all cars up not just evs
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,great video the car the new fiat 500 should have always been
2020-12-02,YouTube Comment,i saw carwow do a video on this and ive been waiting to see it since its stunning
2022-03-06,YouTube Comment,gotta love that car cover though
2022-01-20,YouTube Comment,i own a fiat 500e and no way can you get 199 miles i drive 23 miles to work but use around double that in range loss
2022-01-02,YouTube Comment,i want one so bad i wish they sold this in the states electric convertible its perfect
2022-01-03,YouTube Comment,lots of americans seem to like the idea of the 500e hopefully they bring it over there
2021-11-26,YouTube Comment,so excited i have just signed on the dotted line for this car today i had it out for a 40 min test drive this morning and fell in love only downside is i have to wait until january for it
2021-10-29,YouTube Comment,carrying people in the back of your car is not an emergency it could possibly be on the odd occasion
2021-10-28,YouTube Comment,im a 23 year old man and even i love this car got one on order
2021-10-27,YouTube Comment,i cant wait for an abarth 500e but im worried how expensive it might be if its 40k then it will be a hard sell
2021-10-20,YouTube Comment,cheap lecky cars junk no range bad ride quality heavy batteries throw u about dont listen to these blaggers test drive on bumpy road this person knows nothing about cars
2021-10-10,YouTube Comment,top review top totty sorry good detail and yes i to love the new 500
2021-09-22,YouTube Comment,i wish they sell this car in us
2021-09-19,YouTube Comment,i want that car cover for my classic 2015 fiat 500e
2021-08-16,YouTube Comment,just 21000 just why is it two times the price of the nearly identical petrol version im out until they become much cheaper
2021-08-16,YouTube Comment,it is true that its very sad when 21000 is at the lowest scale of evs
2021-06-25,YouTube Comment,haha im getting mine in 3 days i cant wait you people must try it out its so amazing to drive it
2021-06-26,YouTube Comment,how exciting what colour did you go for
2021-06-26,YouTube Comment,autosocialuk im getting a cabrio ocean green laprima
2021-06-13,YouTube Comment,fantastic review and a fantastic little accessory
2021-06-16,YouTube Comment,autosocialuk no at all yet able to say so well grill detail wheels and so on even though english is not my first language
2021-06-11,YouTube Comment,i really enjoy watching your reviews very informative and straight to the point excellent
2021-06-10,YouTube Comment,looking for an ev to replace my current fiat 500 and what do you know fiat 500e is the only good looking option although it is a shame that it costs double the price of the ice models i am sure that the build quality is nowhere near the 30k price tag and the government grand at this point feels more like a reason to keep the prices high since all the marketing materials tell you the price with the grand included hopefully it will be possible to find a used one for 1520k in a couple of years please do not support this 30k ev madness affordable evs is what we need to save the planet
2021-06-12,YouTube Comment,i could not agree more i think brands like dacia will start building affordable evs and that will bring the prices done fingers crossed the entry level 500e doesnt even have a radio that is madness
2021-06-09,YouTube Comment,i had an original fiat 500 although i like the look of the electric vehicle technology scares me a bit i would buy one just because its so compact and it has a decent range i dont think of it as a girlie car well i drive a smart diesel 😁
2021-06-12,YouTube Comment,the tech can be a bit bossy sometimes when youre driving its always bleeping for something or another
2021-06-06,YouTube Comment,great review and a wonderful little car if i went electric this is the one as i loved my twin air an icon
2021-06-05,YouTube Comment,it is la prima pronounce preema and not le primma also the t is silent in renault apart from that nice review
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,overhyped and waaay overpriced
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,i havent really heard many people mentioning them and the prices are in line with other electric cars
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,great review thank you would love to see you review the minie and compare the two
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,they couldnt even change the start engine button to something else smh
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,very good point although as it is under 35k you do get the 2500 government grant as well
2021-06-12,YouTube Comment,paolopetrozzi2213 yes because youre only ever allowed to compare convertibles with other convertibles as enshrined in the law
2021-06-12,YouTube Comment,af252 if you want a convertible you cannot have it from tesla so your price comparison does not make any sense at all how old are you 12
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,honestly i always liked fiat 500s ill never buy one because im 64 but to anyone smaller its a great car
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,using the 500 logo to hide the sensors is great idea love it who would buy one with the small battery as a second city only car used leafs and zoes exist for under half the price
2021-06-04,YouTube Comment,i like the new front badge not sure on the rear one yer its definitely something you would get if you loved fiats and didnt need to go far
2021-06-06,YouTube Comment,comparing new and used caror anything really will almost always favor the used ones at any price range so for me personally its a bit unfair
2021-06-08,YouTube Comment,autosocialuk yeah its pretty ordinary at the back the square lights dont help
2021-06-08,YouTube Comment,hellmekun for the same range and just commute abilities why spend the extra money where is the extra tech compared to an old leaf on the 500 it doesnt move the game on
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,great video tish currently watching this in the hospital again and not to be cliché but it did take my mind off what was happening for a bit not the biggest fan of the 500 but it just makes sense to be an ev
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,lovely review 😍
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,that car would suit you i think tish i love the design of the steering wheel too
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,lets be honest for 33000 pounds its too little a car you are getting looks alone cant replace practicality and economy if you are paying such a heavy bag of cash and dont get the range space and other basics then i think its exploitation in the name of e cars actually almost all the car makers are doing that these days how do you save when you are paying huge cash upfront and lose the peace of mind that you get with ices good city cars in my opinion were nissan micra and suzuki alto in the late 90s and 2000s
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,another great review tish really useful information for people who are interested in purchasing one i love the front end styling not keen on the stitching of fiat in the seats though for me its a bit too much is a mirror in the drivers sunvisor that important for a lady looking for a car
2021-11-26,YouTube Comment,as a female i find it bizarre that fiat 500s do not have a mirror on drivers visor strange but important no not for this female i test drive one of these today my 1st of a few test drives id lined uphad to cancel all others i loved this car so much
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,a other cracking review tish really enjoying the electric reviews i am waiting for the all electric pickupbeing a pickup fan i am surprised we havent got one yet keep up the great reviews 😉
2022-09-14,YouTube Comment,there you are jim your prayers have been answered httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv6tkpj09xmbut708sab_channelcarwow
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,nice looking fiat very modern looking too like the colour of it also
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,whats bad about not being first
2021-06-03,YouTube Comment,davedvideomaker by me saying first is one of many ways i like to show support to tish if you dont like it dont make any comments
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,nice cars 😍
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,lovely gorgeous and great lookingthe cars not bad either😜
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,i enjoyed watching the video review i particularly like the interior design
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,thank you jamie the interior was great
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,nice review tish cute little car this fiat 500e but too girly for a bloke like myself some girls might but do you really need that mirror 😎😎
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,hahaha mirrors are handy even if you want to check you havent got something in your teeth 😅😅😅
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,absolutely awesome review the fiat 500e looks absolutely stunning compared to previous models looking forward to the next review
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,its a really cool little car now i liked it a lot 😁
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,great car but too expensive
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,yes i see your point although the cheapest spec costs less than the honda e and mini electric
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,the normal fiat 500 is seriously uncool but the 500e is better plus they used to sell a previous 500 electric in north america
2021-06-02,YouTube Comment,yer they definitely feel and drive a lot better than the standard car
2024-05-17,YouTube Comment,guy wheeling a scooter only in miami and certain parts of the bronx i really considered getting one of the previous 500e way back before covid i think the golfball dimples were inspired by that one mythbusters episode i didnt have easy access to a charger unfortunately and charging infrastructure _still_ doesnt seem ideal but i like that theyre back with the new one as someone who likes small cars
2024-05-07,YouTube Comment,happy with my honda jazz crosstar 2023 hybridmore interior roommore safetys10 airbags and utillitiesreliable and build qualityfor 32 000 e
2024-05-07,YouTube Comment,i think these are great fold those back seats down and you got a great hatchback thats a blast to drive i had the previous model it was a blast this should be even better
2024-05-06,YouTube Comment,when covering evs it would be nice if you knew what battery chemistry is being used how many charging cycles energy density in whkg cooling features preconditioning features battery crate who makes the battery etc please consider providing this info in future videos for 35k i can buy a low mileage used kia ev6 with a 310 mile range this car is too expensive
2024-04-21,YouTube Comment,a version of this emulating the 1959 fiat jolly would be nice especially since the sound is gone needs some soul injected back into it
2024-04-17,YouTube Comment,yes needs to be priced like the upcoming renault twingo ev
2024-04-16,YouTube Comment,having driven the 500e and owned the previous mini cooper electric which one would you rather purchase to cruise around the city
2024-04-16,YouTube Comment,if it had about 52kw batteryi would consider iti like the looks much better than the konawhich i think is fuglybut with the longer range
2024-04-12,YouTube Comment,i had a 2013 500e and the sales lady fit in the back seat just fine i had a friend who had a kid that was 810 years old and she liked riding back there but most of the time i kept the rear seats down and that makes a really great cargo area i used it to take my folding ebikes to trails if they made the front passenger seat fold it would be even better
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,good city car or country car or anything car except frequent long trips
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,i am still waiting for my red order to be built and shipped it is perfect for ny city
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,for the price of a loaded 500e its competing with a base tesla model 3 which has more range nearly double the acceleration more interior space an extra set of doors more cargo space nicer interior materials and the second lowest probably of injury in an accident by the nhtsa
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,too too expensive otherwise its ideal for the elderly driverif price lower it would sell in thousands
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,brilliant car i love those lovely european city cars planning on getting one
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,i too am a fan boy of sub compacts and this is the one ive been waiting for i was very excited to see your review posted tonight thanks for making my day
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,price is fine but the range will kill it before it can even get started
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,looks like a good city car for one or two people price is too high as mentioned by another poster buy on the used market in a few years
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,we own the new 500e in europe it is a really good electric car and we love it good for city driving but also very nice to drive on the highway has level 2 autonimous driving which works fine if you have owned the previous 500 model petrol or ev this is a hugh step forward
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,i love this car homelike the old bmw i3
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,so if youre in the heat using the ac full blast the range is maybe 120mi
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,i dont know about the us market but in europe you can get a used telsa for 17k but absolutely not the old 500e if you can even find one people seem to keep them
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,buddy1155 unfortunately for you im in la which is probably also why there are so many available in the states cali ran an incentive program that encouraged a lot of people to buy into the 500e line
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,a teeny car what happens when the fiat 500e meets a escalade iq in a narrow alley with no passing room well its a lot of things but sexy isnt one of them
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,we preorder the new rose gold trim inspired by beauty however after meeting with the local dealer even with the 7500 lease credit through stellantis lease was still quoted over 600mo for 10000mi 36mo term before credit check just their best estimate and that was even with a 3000 trade in credit old fiat 500 on top of that the msrp and terrible lease numbers are going to ruin the success of this car before it even gets off the starting line im genuinely offended by the pricing of this car being a longtime fiat fan
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,thats a shame i owned a bolt for a year and a half but realized i dont actually need all that range and smaller would be more useful for my city driving this is the perfect range and size and presumably a nicer interior for about the same price as my bolt was but a 600mo lease is nuts
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,we purchased our stepdaughter who was in high school at the time an offlease low mileage fiat 500e which depreciated and we were able to get at 10000k frankly its the perfect car for a teenager the range was fine for her to drive to school and in town trips and it charged overnight on level 1 she loved it loved the looks and size and she kept with the electric motif and now drives a bmw ix which she uses as a tax writeoff for her business what was unique was that we bought the car in colorado and the dealer had them shipped out to denver due to them being a glut in california if we lived in ca i remember at the time seeing those 99 leases and would have leased her one
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,its too expensive here in europe because fiat wants the affluent mini buyers the 500e should come as a giardinia eatate it should offer a mid teir baytery between 24kwh and 44kwh and above all else a panda version on the same platform
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,agreed a small relatively inexpensive ev may be the best application for electric vehicles we have an overabundance of largeexpensivecomplex vehicles that are out of reach for most people i really dont care about the next high priced ev and i say that as the owner of a bmw i4 for a year and a half now small inexpensive uncomplicated evs should be a focal point for auto manufacturers get the price down more worry more about charging infrastructure than range and i think the market will grow
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,im glad to see it in the us i love my mini cooper se but if the fiat 500e had existed last year i would have been torn on which one to get
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,american bottoms are too big for this car
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,regenerative braking should primarily be done when applying the brake pedal not automatically with one pedal driving i know ev buyers love one pedal driving but aggressive one pedal driving can be dangerous particularly in the city you cant maintain speed and cover the brake pedal at the same time reducing your reaction time this is one of the reasons tesla has such extremely high accident rates
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,in driving school you are taught when and where to cover the brake pedal like around pedestrians or when a driver is sitting in a car that is parallel parked
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,i disagree having blended braking can make the brake pedal very unpredictable in a lot of cars like in the maverick hybrid where it feels like youre slamming on the brakes below 7mph and its extremely hard to stop smoothly i prefer having the brake pedal just connected hydraulically and leave the gas pedal liftoff for regen gives you more braking confidence when you need it if you make the regen strong enough it should be able to bring the vehicle to a stop quickly and smoothly especially once you get used to it
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,blackvillain that is a separate issue that isnt found in all cars with regenerative braking regardless one pedal driving shouldnt replace covering your brake pedal regenerative braking is not meant for emergency stops it shouldnt matter how smooth it is or isnt an emergency stop is an emergency stop the faster you stop the better
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,allentechpt9026 exactly regen doesnt replace emergency stops thats what your brake pedal is for if you have your foot off of the gas pedal while regening anyway theres no reason you cant cover the brake pedal for an emergency stop i did this the few times back when i had my i3 and was driving downtown in urban areas
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,blackvillain yes there is a reason if regen is so strong you are going to keep your foot on the accelerator to maintain speed this means you cannot cover the brake and maintain speed this is not a problem in cars without regen
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,stgeorgee im not wrong about anything you cannot maintain speed with regenerative brake your comment doesnt refute that
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,kendrick5909 you can also fail a driving exam by use of regenerative brake
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,due the lack of proper driver training many people dont even comprehend the purpose of covering the brake
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,geragosian805 thats right there are examples of people falling drivers tests because they didnt cover their brake pedals
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,allentechpt9026 i feel like you havent driven many evs or at least not for a long period of time theres no reason to maintain speed in an ev you see your intersectionstop signwhatever coming up you know how long it takes the car to naturally stop you let off of the gas you can feel free to cover the brake pedal from that point if youre in an area with pedestrians
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,this also can apply to engine and exhaust brakes on diesels on our trucks diesels the exhaust brakes only work at certain rpm at low speeds and low rpm the exhaust brake completely shuts off those who complain about poor blending brakes well that to your delivery driver its about the most poorly blended braking you can imagine still its for safety because its better than slower reaction time covering the brake is just basic basic safety training
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,blackvillain part of my job is driving evs or cars with regenerative braking i also work with insurance companies that are studying this issue regenerative braking has become a massive safety issue in any way your ad hominem doesnt refute a thing ive said so everything i said still stands
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,geragosian805 yes exactly any properly trained driving examiner will give you an automatic failure for overuse of regen
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,akiowasright the cut off isnt necessary due to safety programming exhaust brakes stall or lug the engine at low rpm
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,allentechpt9026 i understand im just saying that your point is already understood by many a lot of ev drivers havent learned yet
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,one pedal driving bub you miss that part
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,im surprised more people havent pointed this out the first time i drove an ev its one of the first things i noticed you could not coast or cover the brake pedal without the car slowing itself down or stopping completely thankfully some electric cars allow you to turn it off i believe
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,krane15 how did i miss one pedal driving
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,im not disagreeing but there is a reason they invented automatic emergency braking its not a 100 solution nor should it replace proper driving skill but thats whats expected these days drivers generally do not have the attentiveness or skill to avoid certain accidents many dont really even have a general grasp of defensive driving talking about covering the brakes and its purpose are beyond most drivers theyre just not to that level because of low standards for licensing they were not to the level from the start
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,geragosian805 yes but many still get by the examiners often dont pay attention to your pedal control there needs to be strict rules on this
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,you can just set the cruise control to maintain speed then cover the brake but you do you
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,ridiculous its the same as an automatic no one drives with both feet on the pedals false statistic about teslas
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,rp9674 covering the brake pedal doesnt necessarily involve both feet really this is basic stuff its very clear you arent a properly trained driver also its not a false static the data was collected by lendingtree between november 2022 and november 2023 with 2354 accidents per 1000 drivers tesla had the highest accident rate
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,cloud30000 youre going to set the cruise just to cover the brake where do you people come up with this how did you get a drivers license
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,allentechpt9026 you mean my class a cdl with endorsements i guess im just lucky or maybe you dont know as much about driving as you seem to proclaim
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,i dont have time to teach everyone how to drive
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,allentechpt9026 you think teslas accident statistics might have more to do with poorly marketing autopilot and full self driving over one pedal driving do all onepedalmode evs have higher accident statistics than their ice equivalents
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,cloud30000 its not just tesla evs overall have higher accident rates thats not all because of one pedal driving but thats just one of the many things
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,rp9674 i do so listen and learn this is what drivers ed says the cover braking technique involves taking your right foot off the accelerator and holding it over the brake pedal if you have to stop quickly your foot is already above the brake pedal and is in the perfect position to press the brake this method will improve your reaction time so whenever you identify a hazard cover the brake to prepare for sudden stops or slowing when covering the brake be careful not to rest your foot on the brake pedal also known as riding the brake riding the brake is not recommended it will only confuse other drivers and add unnecessary wear to the brakes simple isnt it
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,cloud30000 with your suggestion any driver would fail an exam again how did you get drivers license
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,allentechpt9026 can you point out the documented exam criteria that using the cruise control fails if it does not prevent you from covering the brake because i have not heard of such criteria though it has been a long time since ive taken the exam the ev manufacturers would be the first to sue the driving instructorstesters if they cost sales statistics by failing all owners of one pedal mode evs could you link a reliable government source that has acknowledged that one pedal mode has led to license test failures or is this just speculation based on your opinion of what qualifies as preventing passing have you even taken the driving test do you know what it actually consists of how did you get your driving license
2024-04-12,YouTube Comment,allentechpt9026nervous scared drivers are dangerous you should try to relax but stay alert safest if you drive in the right lane
2024-04-12,YouTube Comment,ive driven stick shifts automatic one pedal two pedal braking paddle on the steering wheel it all works the theoretical differences are very minimal in real world
2024-04-12,YouTube Comment,allentechpt9026you know you can move your foot right ive been driving evs for over seven years and i have never had a problem putting my foot on the brake when i needed to stop quickly the overwhelming majority of the time you are used to how the one pedal deceleration works and take your foot off the accelerator and let the thing slow down behind the car in front if i found myself needing to slam the brakes a lot i would need a new insurance company because they record all those stops
2024-04-13,YouTube Comment,allentechpt9026 imagine this situation youre driving along at 60mph and all of a sudden traffic stops in front of you with your foot on the accelerator the moment you lift off to apply the hydraulic brakes the regen is already workibg at max power to slow down before youre even applying the hydraulic brakes if we are using regen on the brake pedal youre driving along and you life off to apply the brakes you get nothing until the brake is fully applyed passed the point of regen having more response is always safer and having the car slow down from lifting your foot up before even applying the brake is going to slow you down faster than if one pedal driving was not enabled
2024-04-13,YouTube Comment,allentechpt9026 i have a feeling its due to a false sense of safety and the kind of people that buy evs are generally those that have their car do the work for them i mean look at all those idiots in teslas falling asleep at the wheel with autopilot when those people drive ice cars they usually have lower tech and must therefore pay attention but once theyre put into a high tech ekectric car that does all the paying attention for them they slack off and let the car do the work thats my thinking as to why evs end up in more accidents its not the cars but the people who choose to buy cars with a high level of technology that lets them be lazy
2024-04-13,YouTube Comment,kenmcclow8963hes talking about emergency braking say youre driving through town coasting you should have your foot above the brake pedal ready to stop when needed in an emergency as someone who also drives evs i still dont see this as an issue because anything other than something apearing right in front of you out of nowhere would make the difference and the moment you fully lift off its already applying max regen belts you apply friction brakes so it really doesnt seem like that big of a deal the problem is the drivers drivibg evs not evs themselves my dad is a good driver but for some reason once he gets into his tesla with all its cameras and sensors he basically completely relys on the car to do the work for him i will never be like this and only use the tech if its better than doing it myself like backibg up using the camera because theres significantly less visibility out the back than in the camera on our car but ill still use mirrors and such and base things off visual cues instead of what the car tells tells me
2024-04-13,YouTube Comment,userrm7kb3il6x the level of assistance from regen braking is minimal you also dont need one pedal driving or even regenerative brakes for that to work many nonregen european cars have had brake assist for years besides covering the brakes still applies to far more situations basically anytime youre in a parking lot anytime youre going through an intersection anytime you drive by pedestrians or parked cars or when the situation can immediately change it can be wise to cover your brake pedal
2024-04-13,YouTube Comment,userrm7kb3il6x one pedal braking is a technology it also makes you lazy and dependent
2024-04-13,YouTube Comment,userrm7kb3il6x i think driving around with a foot hovering in the air above the pedals is a very limited case situation most driving is done with a foot on one pedal or the other my tesla and my vw both have the ability to toggle between a low regen or high regen driving mode amusingly my former fiat had the blended brakes that he seems to prefer
2024-04-13,YouTube Comment,allentechpt9026 my tesla and my vw both have the ability to toggle between low or high regen braking on my model s it is on screen in a menu and on my vw it is on the gear selector my previous fiat had blended brakes with minimal regen outside of pressing the brake both the fiat and vw do not have the ability to turn off creep that mimics a gas cars inability to stop moving in gear so the braking also mimics a gas car tesla lets you turn off creep mode because an electric car is not a gas car i see a lot of accidents in beep and creep but in a tesla with autopilot the car will radar lock on the car in front and accelerate and decelerate to maintain the distance pretty reliably the important thing is to continue looking out the front window and keeping hands on the wheel and feet near the pedals and not watching a movie or playing video games instead i have seen people doing the most completely stupid things in cars in traffic since the 1980s long before there were evs i submit that many accidents in evs are caused because they have a 500 horsepower vehicle that accelerates very quickly and are not used to it thats also why tires get used so quickly my tesla needed new tires at 600000 miles and again 57000 miles later the drivers ed cars where i live are all teslas
2024-04-13,YouTube Comment,allentechpt9026 the level of assistance from regen braking is minimal if youve only driven hybrids like the volt sure but in any one pedal drive car like a tesla its going to slow down as if you were applying the brakes emergency stop no but plenty fast enough to cause an accident if the brake lights dont come on
2024-04-13,YouTube Comment,allentechpt9026 one pedal driving alone doesnt make you lazy it makes it easier yes but it alone isnt going to make you lazy and dependent look at manual vs automatics would you say automatics make you lazy and dependent well compared to a manual yes it does but its not the only factor in making evs more likely to crash
2024-05-06,YouTube Comment,as an experienced ev driver myself ive never had issue with one pedal driving you just learn how to feather the accelerator pedal in such a way that is comfortable to you eventually it is adaptive to muscle memory
2024-05-06,YouTube Comment,panemon187 it adapts quite quickly as well because youre doing it so often maybe on the 3rd drive it starts becoming easy it really isnt an issue for people who have actually used it
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,fiat created a new category under compact and sub compact known as circus
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,this car is a joke the bolt is a much better buy
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,i have a 23 bolt ev and a 2015 fiat 500e the fiat is much more fun to drive even feels quicker off the line
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,i like the car nice will just check it out on the leasing
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,interior needs to be white and it should be under 30k the gas of these car were under 20k
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,white interiors look like an apple store i cant stand them
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,and where would the motor go replace the boot
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,krane15 that is the trunk a boot you put on your foot
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,i just hate seeing a car that should be in the low 20k range priced out in the mid to high 30k range it is a limited use car urban errand runner i cant see spending that much when i can get eventually the xc30 for the same price
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,the msrp doesnt match the size and that was even truer for the original fiat 500e best to get them on lease if in ca where they handed those out like candy or to buy them used with a marked depreciation we purchased an off lease low mileage fiat500e for 10k which at that point made more sense
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,if they priced it rasonably they would have to make more which isnt the point of this car it only exists to comply with fleet requirements for manufacturers they want to sell as few as possible and use the limited battery available to sell 100k pickup trucks and suvs
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,no ev in low 20k all fantasy
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,rp9674 exactly even the ice version of the 500 is over 30k no wonder stelantis isnt selling cars right now
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,if they 2017 bolt was able to get 238 miles of range how is this only able to get 100 something i understand its a little shorter but the difference is startling good effort though
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,i think the bolt has a back seat thats actually usable so its a bigger car this fiat is really a two seater with a usable trunk when you fold down the rear
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,we wouldve killed for the chevy bolt in europe and only a very few opel amperas were imported before gm sold off opel and vauxhall to psa now stellantis
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,isnt this a compliance vehicle so they can continue to sell 100k pickup trucks and suvs
2024-04-11,YouTube Comment,compliance vehicles should be judged on its own merits still a vehicle
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,leasing a vehicle is the most expensive way to operate one facts are your friends
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,lease happens to qualify for ev tax credit which most lease companies pass on if you buy you need to comply with income limits to qualify for federal ev tax credits
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,for the poors yes but if you have the money its not like youre not getting any benefits and also some lease deals are too good to pass up like the current deal on ioniq 6s
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,thought its built in poland on their stellantis factory but smart people corrected me already turns out in italy good review
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,in california this car is a much better deal in the big cities than toyota mirai by driving which you might not find hydrogen for refueling due to closing broken out of order stations this one can be charged overnight even from a regular outlet
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,the answer to the question in the title is in your tfl studios the original fiat 500 bought to be as a cool decoration so if original can be a show off why new one shouldnt be used as a real city commuter
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,it was never a gas pedal what car is powered by gas
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,its not horse power either now how do you like those apples
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,love it its actually affordable and functional at the same time short range means less expensive and less charging time which is good for short trips which is what evs are good for
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,nevco8774that citroen ami is a joke this fiat 500 is a proper ev that doesnt lug around a huge expensive battery like a tesla nice charming ev maybe the only ev with charm
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,nevco8774lots of ugliness definitely agree😂
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,any car can make short range trips you dont need to spend 35000 on an affordable ev
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,nevco8774 who said anything about 23 year old car or clunkers 35000 is 2x the price of basically any new model subcompact ice car
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,nevco8774 there are many many decent ice cars for well under 35000 besides that setting decent as a standard when talking about a fiat is rather humorous
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,nevco8774 then why is any of this relevant to you
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,nevco8774 the gas version of the last generation fiat 500 was under 17000 now that the 500 is ev only its more than doubled in price
2024-04-10,YouTube Comment,allentechpt9026true the ice cars are cheaper but im speaking to those who look for an ev this would be the best ev because its small quick charging and doesnt carry a huge expensive battery for long trips evs in general should be for short daily driving and this 500 fits that category well
2024-05-13,YouTube Comment,nevco8774it might have a higher dc charge rate but since the bolt has a bigger battery charge times are about the same to get the equivalent of 100 miles in both
2024-01-25,YouTube Comment,i like it i like the headlamps and the simple design of the car wish these were more popular in los angeles uber and los angeles need to make these robo taxis
2023-11-08,YouTube Comment,i dont know if youre really short or if the car is really tall
2023-09-26,YouTube Comment,i absolutely love fiats i live in the us my first car was a little red fiat and my second vehicle was a 2015 ev fiat i like them a ton because theyre just so weird and quirky but they do it in a way that is stylish i really want to continue owning a fiat even just as a secondary fun car but i feel like they really need to commit and find a niche to fill right now the entry level sub compact ev market is up for the taking its insane they dont capitalize on it like legitimately 52000 for any car that offers this range and level of materials etc is going to flop regardless of brand or design the chevy bolt here in the us has 270 miles of range at 27000 there is no way they are going to compete with that paying almost 200 more you still receive plastic molded interior less range and essentially just a different design language to top it all off fiat has no where near the support and repairability of something like chevy thats a big deal because getting them serviced will be annoying and too proprietary
2023-11-06,YouTube Comment,52k is equivalent of 338k in usd but yeh its still way overpriced i think stellantis and many legacy automakers have deliberately overpriced their evs because they want to keep sales low and high profit as they certainly their ceo at least are clearly antiev and are intent on slowing down the transition away from ice cars as long as possible it simply cannot cost anywhere near the asking price to make a small 2 door car with a 37kwh battery and 87kw motor this strategy will ultimately backfire imo
2023-11-15,YouTube Comment,fangitjoe youre not referring to former ceo marchionne are you he was antiev but died five years ago stellantis like most car companies knows electric is the future
2023-11-16,YouTube Comment,apexerman1 tavares will say electric is the future on one day and say electrification is impossible on the next httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkaggr1mcqqy
2023-09-25,YouTube Comment,this car is now being heavily discontinued in the uk it was far too expensive when launched and the new electric mini is likely to take the majority of sales in this category
2023-09-24,YouTube Comment,i like everything except the headlights swap them for the proper full rounds and maybe touch up the grille shape and its perfect
2023-09-22,YouTube Comment,im pretty sure if people are silly enough to spend that much on cars they dont question the hard plastics of the interior i dont know why australian car reviewers always mention it
2023-09-21,YouTube Comment,way too expensive id prefer a tesla model 3 every day
2024-03-14,YouTube Comment,thats more expensive than this car and repairs on that thing will be as insane
2023-09-21,YouTube Comment,im review cars guys
2024-06-02,YouTube Comment,tom i have enjoyed your content for many years now and yes you should have over 1m subscribers in order to achieve that however you likely need more content 2x or 3x per week with more variety comparison tests longterm vehicles etc and take advantage of martin let him share his feedback at the endcould be an interesting contrast to your own views also werent you supposed to buy a cadillac lyriq or similar ev was looking forward to hearing your decision
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,hard to pump out that kind of volume and keep the quality up martin does the occasional cameo thats it still thinking about an ev but waiting until fall now focusing on my daughters wedding
2024-06-02,YouTube Comment,get a model 3 standard with the tax credit and it will cost the same have far greater range and be far far safer
2024-05-27,YouTube Comment,bang for buck is way too low paying 34k for cute and attitude seriously reliability get a small real car from a real maker
2024-05-25,YouTube Comment,its an extremely tough sell at 34000 this one is strictly for the die hard fiat fans
2024-05-25,YouTube Comment,im convinced that prices will drop
2024-05-25,YouTube Comment,shame because its such a cool car for the right use case but that price yikes
2024-05-20,YouTube Comment,i like this car and believe it will sell well much better than the gas version or older e version we need more cars like this for the daily commuter
2024-05-20,YouTube Comment,what this needed was a hybrid engine adding to the battery range imo more hybrids are needed in the mktplace
2024-05-17,YouTube Comment,great alternative to the mini se and bmw i3 ev city cars for the win
2024-05-17,YouTube Comment,this is the best looking electric car ever
2024-05-15,YouTube Comment,at 34k this is only 6k less than a tesla model y which is probably 3 times the size with 300 miles of ev range
2024-05-13,YouTube Comment,some of these are already seeing significant discounts making them serious contenders vs mini se your review is the best of any vehicle i have ever seen and incredibly engaging while providing all the ammo i need to sell it to my wife thanks for the presentation
2024-05-13,YouTube Comment,everyone is lying to you tom surprised you have the subscriber count that you do quit whining about it
2024-05-12,YouTube Comment,i mean the tesla model 3 will be eligible for the tax credit soon and then you can get a huge amount more car for less than 2000 more but sure it is cute
2024-05-11,YouTube Comment,150 miles dang thats about the gas powered fiats lasted until repairs were needed 😊😊😊
2024-05-11,YouTube Comment,cars im considering for next year this volvo ex30 and the mini se if they come out with a mini convertibledone deal
2024-05-11,YouTube Comment,put a gas engine in it and i would buy it i love small hatchbacks
2024-05-11,YouTube Comment,perfect city car hope cars like this get more popular
2024-05-11,YouTube Comment,are americans ever gonna see the variety of evs or only the expensive in europe and asia you can buy evs starting at 10k
2024-05-11,YouTube Comment,are you talking about the citroen ami its effectively an enclosed golf cart it would never pass american crash standards and americans would never buy anything that small or slow pretty much the same for any of those european cars even the chinese sourced ones that are under 25000
2024-05-11,YouTube Comment,drivencarreviews renault peugeot vw bmw mercedes all kind of amazing lightweight city evs
2024-05-13,YouTube Comment,drivencarreviewsa couple of weeks ago i saw an actual golf cart with a license plate on a suburban road
2024-05-11,YouTube Comment,34000 what a ripoff not to sell limited range and just tiny maybe if sold at 19000 then might sell a few
2024-05-10,YouTube Comment,i think the mini countryman se all4 will provide little more room and a longer body plus it looks nicer inside this 500e is too small for my taste in cars
2024-05-10,YouTube Comment,the url for your quoting service is wrong drivenquotes vs quotesdriven
2024-05-10,YouTube Comment,this is just as laughably bad as the original e500 worthless at any speed and please morons who buy this usually birdbrain shopaholic auto illiterate females who appreciate its ease of parking downtown do not have an accident i in one the other driver will survive but you sure as hell will not ps this is twice as expensive as such a pos should be
2024-05-10,YouTube Comment,electric garbage the hybrid is much better and with the fuel efficiency it makes no sense to use this
2024-05-10,YouTube Comment,fiat you berry phunnie😂
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,the problem with all the european small electric car is too expensive where its cant compete with china made which cost a few grand
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,fiat has a terrible quality rating by numerous legitimate consumer groups buyer beware
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,the one disincentive to buying electric cars in places like the state of georgia they have an alternative vehicle fuel tax of 21087 a year if you dont drive that many miles per year this is a total ripoff and yet the governor claims he is trying to promote evs i have a gasoline powered fiat 500 abarth and the parts and the cost of running that car is almost nothing plus it only cost 17000 i fill up once a month 10 gallons
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,this car is too expensive you could buy a civic si with money to spare for the price of this thing
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,its too damn expensive this will cause its demise and fall like smart car i can buy tesla model y with this price
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,would be the perfect car to own for city driving for around 15k grand at over double that price its a no no car there is just too much thats far better in the used market for that money
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,awesome head the previous gen theyre a blast to drive
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,love this would love it more if they could shave 10k off the price thank you for todays video
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,im glad fiat is back in the game with a new 500 and this one is as cute as a button
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,i think fiat made a bad decision by not giving you a loaded version to review tom this is the only city car with level 2 autonomous driving its a traffic jam star
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,what is your opinion between this fiat 500 e and the mini cooper se
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,really like this car even though it doesnt meet my needs with a family but i would recommend it to a friend especially given the previous 500e was probably fiats most reliable car ever also thanks for not being bought by big charger most car reviewers say everyone has to get a level 2 but these city focused cars are well suited to be charged with a regular wall outlet since id bet the vast majority dont go more than 40 miles per day
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,cute but 35k and fiats perceived reliability just is a no go looking forward to see what sales figures on these end up being
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,thank you for reviewing a vehicle with the appearance and the size of a normal car not a humongous suv or a pickup truck as much as i like the 500 styling it is a very niche car probably will be great for downtown london or paris maybe for san francisco as well one third of new vehicle registrations in sf are evs but 35k fifteen years ago one could buy a subcompact for 15k returning 3035 mpg and keep extra 20k for movies and night clubs fiat itself stopped selling gasolinepowered 500 in the us bring back the old times ps tossible
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,i like your car reviews and your personal comments are
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,for 10k less you can buy a toyota corolla hybrid with more than double the range and probably double the residual value tom you really loose credibility when you pitch something like the 500e as a good city car if you put your ev bias aside youd have given this nothing but a big red light
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,the right tool for the job doug corolla hybrid isnt nearly as fun to drive harder to park and lacks personalty thats fine for many traditional buyers my bias is towards cars that nail their mission ice or ev i enjoyed my time in the 500e so did my passengers something i pay attention to value is different for every buyer ask anyone choosing between a tahoe and escalade
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,a city ev with decent charging and for a city ev very good range nice yes its small but ummmm city car missed the price and went back to the beginning for it 34k really there are a lot of used bolts and leafs out there seems like the price is gonna cause sales to be light i might be wrong i remember time tunnel james darren lee meriweather
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,bolt and leaf especially used are great values they lack the personality of the fiat some will pay for that
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,tom if you want 1233 a foldflat front passenger seat toyota will be happy to sell you one with their two door tacoma that has to be the craziest location for one in the whole industry
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,foldflat front passenger seat foldflat rear bench and a separately opened rear window 2003 toyota matrix imho one of the best compact cars ever
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,tinleadhammer as the owner of a 2005 pontiac vibe it is hard for me to disagree😉 on a serious note it is irritating to see features like the foldflat front seat and 402040 second row seats disappear from the industry
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,contrary to misinformation electric cars are becoming more popular tom voelk all is forgiven we all misspeak from time to time still a great channel and will remain a subscriber
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,043 that ghost of the exceo should go lie down and rot he singlehandedly stunted fiat for 8 years that survived mostly on 500 and panda revenue if not the massive that he aimed to be there wouldve been years more rd and this 500e couldve been achievable at the same price or less before 2020 isnt that not a problem
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,coming from ireland europe 157 absolutely fk bn btw he is an absolute pox who should not be associated in any good faith or light theres a lot of potential in the 500e it is unfortunately tailored as the familys fourth car to rival a mini it is unfortunately not accessible enough even as a 24kwh in eu there should me a 2832kwh battery option and definitely a 16kwh twinair rex it should come with a giardinia estate there should be a panda thats more practical and affordable based on the same architecture of the 500e
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,sweet little car
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,meeh just put back the gas engine in it
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,how can you not smile looking at this little thing when i visited rome two months ago 500s were everywhere and it really added to the ambiance im curious as to whether the fed tax credit for leasing is still factored in if you were to buy out the lease im a complete knob when it cones to leasing so i have no clue how that works
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,as a happy owner of two fiats id really like to see the company sell the 500e here as a mainstream product like the old 500 not drop special editions on us once or twice a year as they currently plan to do stellantis markets fiat here in the us as an upmarket brand but honestly if they brought vehicles here like the tipo and panda and positioned fiat as a hipper budgetfriendly alternative they could generate sales that would otherwise go to the likes of toyota and honda
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,its a fantastic car for city everyday useplus its an ev
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,i live in the uk and these are far from rare here the range is no issue for most i mean be realistic most usa commutes are 40 miles at most just plug back in when you get home like you do with your phone and youll be fine really hope this sells well for fiat
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,americans use their vehicles quite differently but yeah it would work fine for many singles and couples
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,fiat fix it again tomorrow
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,very nice looking car but only 149 miles not sure americans will pay that high price for a car that doesnt travel past 200 miles on a single charge
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,yup its for a specific buyer its not like fiat plans to move 100k in the us
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,drivencarreviews thats a great point didnt think about the volume they plan on selling
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,putting that new charger to work nice tom
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,stellantis probably doesnt expect big sales numbers with this 500e in the us they do sell well in europe where this car makes sense if you would drive in france a rav4 or rogue will feel too clumsy and big for parking spaces and small roads not to mention underground parking where a rav4 will curb the wheels and scrape the bumpers on the first go anyone who has been to paris or rome probably has seen what parking on a small street looks like also a small electric car has smaller car tax and sales tax which favors smaller economical cars to me 500e is part of fiats identity they make those smaller cars because even though it isnt profitable it marks the identity of the brand
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,the inly thing i hate is the 20mph thing lmao its too corny for me😂 this is coming from a dude whos owned 2 fiats i have ny limits too
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,fwiw my wife couldnt hear it kind of faint had a hard time micing it
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,i had a 2015 500e it only had like 80 miles of range if we had 150 it would have easily covered every single trip even for longer drives
2024-05-13,YouTube Comment,yep same here but my chevy bolt has over 200 miles of range minus the fiat style for me range won out in the end
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,i agree with what others said about this compared to a new or even used new leaf or mini se ev when the 1st fiat 500e in 2014 chryslers chief executive sergio marchionne 500e famously said to an audience at the brookings institute i hope you dont buy it because every time i sell one it costs me 14000 im honest enough to tell you that if i recall correctly the 1st generation sold so poorly that fiat had to severely discount them 10k i have an acquaintance in soca who bought one for a commute that fit in its range and it was amazingly cheap to buy and drive back then at this price with this range even though it is a big improvement over the 2014 models 84 miles and lack of dealer network it looks to me like this is still a money losing proposition for fiat
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,insanely poor value its 414month vs 330month for tesla model 3 with 271 mile range what kind of a review is this hopefully the audience is smarter and does their own research
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,ill add a half dozen folks that asked about the fiat liked the fact that this was not a tesla and didnt blink at the price
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,i get that its cute but not a good value its worth about 25k given the competition i suspect fiat will be discounting heavily or perhaps they dont care since its a low production volume compliance car for them idk a used bmwi3 or late model 500e might be a better value
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,34000 is this fiat joke
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,drivencarreviews i know which one we will get first
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,beautiful car crazy that it took so long to come to our shores and we dont even get all the options in europe its got a beautiful panoramic roof great review as always tom
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,ive added this one to my subcompact ev listamazing
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,i have been watching you for years and enjoy your reviews hope your summer goes well how about a mini jcw
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,scuderia was able to retrofit a 200 mile battery pack into the old 500e why is the new pack small
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,cost bigger batteries cost a lot more also its a city car it doesnt need to go 300 miles on a charge
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,hey tom would it be more appropriate to suggest charging speeds in terms of miles of range per hour so a 120v wall outlet is 3 or 4 miles per hour and l2 closer to 30 miles people can then gauge that to how long they usually park overnight so maybe 3040 miles recharged daily on a wall socket its less daunting to think about that way imo
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,perfect ev for city commuters and tight parking my commute is 5 miles in la traffic and my workplace has free chargers
2024-05-11,YouTube Comment,5 miles get an ebike
2024-05-18,YouTube Comment,this cars ice brother couldve been bought in 2019 for 12000 here in europe that someone buying city microcar for 36000 usd finds it perfect tells us that we live in alternative universes
2024-05-18,YouTube Comment,msjl6dlyep the most brainwashed and gaslighted people on the planet even on the flat earth 😉
2024-05-18,YouTube Comment,msjl6dlyou are absolutely right bro even a stupid leaf blower that costs 1295 at aldi in germany costs 3999 dollar at aldi in america
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,its about 7k too expensive before the tax credit on the lease if this was high20s plus the lease credit itd be unstoppable as a second or third car for a family 149 miles is plenty for the type of driving this will be used for
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,a city ev in a city where there are no places to chargeevery major city in the usa
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,some major cities have plenty of places to charge others well its coming and pretty quickly
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,not sure where you live but ive never had an issue even when i didnt have l2 charging still best to charge at home
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,congratulations on the level 2 charger at your home
2024-05-26,YouTube Comment,to me having a l2 at home is a must for ev drivers
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,200 mile range and the previous generations convertible top would really tempt me with that top down youd probably be back around 140 mile range
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,i only drive 50 miles a month would love to have this car for 26500 great price
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,this is a fantastic car for city living hoping to see more smaller evs like this coming out soon great vid
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,if it was 28k and got 170 miles of range i think it would be a hit and its almost there they could knock the price tho at least
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,drivencarreviews wheres your evil twin to stand in for you
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,drivencarreviews oh my thats terrible maybe hes moved up here to canada
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,the leaf would be a better choice more room and range for the same price similar to the mini also which has more room and range and thus more utility
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,practicality is relative this can park in spaces the leaf cant also the leaf is hideousand if you really need more practicality and dont have children just remove the rear seats altogether then you have a microvan with even greater range due to the lightweighting
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,evs are dead long live hybrids
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,hybrids are dead long live evs
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,mrd5024 a few brands have slowed a bit other brands are selling record numbers overall ev sales are up and expected to keep going up along with this the adoption of wind solar and battery storage for the global electric grid is accelerating rapidly this is great news because how quickly we stop burning fossil fuels will determine how much food your great grandkids will have to eat for dinner
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,i want to see one in person so badly great review as normal tom i imagine we will see broll of you at home charger in ev videos moving forward 😀
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,city car is nonsense you know how gas cars always have a range of 300500 miles its not because thats the limit of how much gas it could hold they could double the tank capacity if they wanted to its not like a 30 gallon tank takes up that much space even in a compact vehicle they have that range because thats what people are comfortable with for the kind of car they buy so the gasoline range of a car could be said to be the ideal range for its segment and how much highway range does the gasoline fiat 500 have almost 350 miles
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,live with an ev and you might find 130 miles is plenty if charging at home its like having a gas station in your garage
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,as a current nissan leaf 40kwh user a range of around 149miles is enough for me couple that with the more common ccs1 plug this is going to sell a lot to urban commuters i like the mini se its also quirky looking like this fiat but the epa range is abysmall the next gen mini se is not that good looking as the fiat 500e too
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,i have a 2023 mini cooper electric and i get between 125 and 150 of range in the la area the range depends on how much freeway or street driving i do
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,an offlease leaf could be had for 12k the last time i checked 35k i dont think so
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,rogermartinez78 ive been to la and the traffic jams there arent as bad as where i live here its almost always a very slow stop and go traffic which means little regen braking thats why most people only get around 114 miles out of full charge coupled with astronomical pricing its 70k here my leaf is 41k and the base model ioniq 5 is 47k and that is if i can find the base model
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,tinleadhammer in the us yes but in my country here its 41k and no rebates though we do get free home charger discounted electricity rates and 25 road tax per year
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,hnrichard stop and go traffic is where evs like the mini cooper electric do great because of the strong regeneration like i said i get about 125 do 70 or more miles per hour
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,rogermartinez78 the stop and go traffic i was referring to is the 2 hour trip for a measly 15 mile trip here thats how bad the stop and go traffic is right here much worse than la im averaging 45kmkwh in that traffic
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,did you say 34k wha for what range 149miles
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,range is overrated even on road trips charging speed and efficiency are equally important if not more so on the other hand if the volvo ex30 comes out at the promised price point it would be a no brainer
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,davidmenasco5743plus what price quality brand value etc the original 500 was useless for long trips as the engine was underpowered and the car is so small anyway so range really is less of an issue for a car this small as for efficiency disappointing
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,some people spend 74k for a car that gets 14 mpg mustand gt 500 its what you are willing to spend for a car that meets your needs right if you need more range its probably best to move along
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,pilot9412 too each his own this car fits its niche really well
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,fiat thinks theres enough of you gullible yanks to buy the highly profitable release before offering more affordable trim and 24kwh thats already in europe
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,they want to decrease co2 in the city before everywhere else there will be a longer range option either on this car or one of their new models
2024-05-09,YouTube Comment,agreed thats more than a little pricey
2024-05-28,YouTube Comment,im fine with the range but i agree regarding the price
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,part of me says this is where the sweet spot for the ev world should beat least for now a city car with many applications i recently saw a clever device that turns street lamps into level 2 chargers widespread avail of charging combined with an under 20k price could give life to this category
2024-05-17,YouTube Comment,tell me more about the device that turns street lights into l2 chargers
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,question i am seeing the display is showing mpge does it have anywhere showing mikw why not my old 2016 500e has that mode available for mikw and a sunroof the dc fast charging is enticing i cant wait if they will come with the usa abarth love those scorpions sounds like the music is castelnuovotedescoheifetz figaro played it once for school great video
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,yeah its cute but a tad pricey at 34k especially so when you consider the huge inevitable depreciation hit
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,this car has a resting bitch face imo and i love it wish i were rich enough to own a second car
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,great review this really is the first ev ive ever found appealing one red light mention should have been the charging time 37 hours how does that compare to the industry average if honda brings their e car to the states that will be real competition
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,the 37 hours is using a 120v wall outlet from 5 and its actually a terrible metric more usefully is to think of it in terms of 4 miles of range for every hour on a wall outlet or 30 miles hour using a 240v wallbox charger
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,looks beautiful really nice design with vw canning the beetle it really helps the fiat 500 especially in europe seeing fiat 500s always reminds me of a friend who had one 15 years ago told me that while they were driving the drivers seat electric motors went crazy and started crushing her into the steering wheel no harm done but im wary of stellantis and electrics
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,she probably hit a button that caused the seat to go forward to allow people into the back and didnt realize it
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,nice little car but not at that price 28k would be good with tesla and ford dropping their ev prices its hard to lease or pay at msrp given the high depreciation of evs
2024-05-08,YouTube Comment,a base tesla model 3 is 39k kia niro ev can be had for the same why on earth would anyone buy this thing
2024-06-04,YouTube Comment,it definitely looks bad thats for sure cant believe that thing is the chargers distant cousin lmao
2024-06-04,YouTube Comment,not even worth 30000 pesos or 30000 nickels
2024-06-04,YouTube Comment,fiat has completely lost their minds someone actually had to approve this mess
2024-06-04,YouTube Comment,thats like probably 15k car asking for double is a crime for humidity

2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,but why tho the body looks like a repurposed regular fiat 500 body too its not like they created a whole new platfrom for the electric model for it to cost that much money
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,the funny part about this is that i think that this is the only fiat car forrest has reviewed so far and fiat aint leaving that much of a good impression
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,the fact this car exists exposes the possibility of a new auto industry bailoutwhy because the new government regulations are requiring car makers to phase out gasoline engines thus in the future when cost of maintenance and replacement of batteries catches up with the electric vehicle owners battery degradation ridiculous labor costs non selling vehicles rotting on the dealer floor the government will put together a bailout with our taxes to pay for the losses due to their bright idea
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,aw yes an ev from a company known for electrical problems genius

2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,just the fact that its a fiat is all i would need to know to steer clear of it

2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,the only downside is price small cheap city cars without a ton of luxury features are very needed right now in the us
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,that price is a rather egregious and glaring downside we are moving in the other direction putting tariffs on chinese offerings
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,if they were needed they would exist the fact that manufacturers are killing their cheap city cars off left and right would seem to suggest that no one actually wants them
2024-06-04,YouTube Comment,the whole car is a downside no range no speed no storage even at 19k would still be a rip off could get so much more 😊

2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,a hyundai tucson cost 40000 and it has way more than anything that excuses for a car offers
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,sooo basically just buy a model 3 or save some money and buy a nissan leaf which isnt much bigger and even that has better range

2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,the leaf is better than this and it sells for like 22k starting and there are incentives on it makes more power than this same range and overall very reliable and proven platform why would you pay as much as a leaf plus w options for less than a base model leaf gives you

2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,so for like 1020k you can get a second hand honda civic or a toyota corolla that will have more features and get you wherever you need to go or you can spend 19k on car that barely has any features and is only meant for driving in city but it doesnt matter because its an ev so youre saving the environment
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,lol fiats have been like this for a long time89 years ago my gf wanted a fiat panda but the young trim which is the lowest end sold for 18000 for the same price she got a lancia ypsilon with custom paint and a proper infotainment system they are overpriced unreliable and do not fit a standard human being i cannot drive those tiny cars or ill press 2 pedals at once

2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,its literally like 95 plastic and has only like 140 miles of range its terrible truly its worth it to spend just a bit more on a model three
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,if this was a attempt to keeping alive the fiat 500 name well they didnt try at all
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,a bad design for a gear selector
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,ya at 19 it screams cheap little run around town car that could be a big hit despite the lack of feature 34 is a hard pass
2024-06-04,YouTube Comment,i saw someone mentioning the car is just to showcase the company is making ev and offset the bad fuel issue they have until they make a good ev
2024-06-04,YouTube Comment,greattaiwanits really just the cost for me 99 of people wanting a car would never consider this
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,you cant just hit us with that absurdity so many times in a row we cant get a break

2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,dude said the car is not worth it a thousand nice ways
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,this car would be good if it retailed for 11k
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,not even bruh
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,evs are expensive they tried to make it as cheap as possible
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,i could deal with the low hp because its enough for an economy car it probably has decent acceleration but the range is too low anything less than 200 miles makes this a car for local driving only
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,100 mile range and the price is more than 30k yeah no thank you
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,if being catfished was a car
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,just get an older fiat 500 cheap and the same hp
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,uzzie88 i agree even for 19k its still not worth it
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,tommasol9701 bullshit man 😂 in india the owners of jag and lr tata motors is pumping out evs for less than 10k which look and are better than whatever the hell this car is
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,uzzie88whats even more insulting is the fact that its the base model and its that expensive with so little features so little as to not even having visor mirrors
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,its to expansive for that little power and range
2024-06-04,YouTube Comment,sheawnv5724huh the video said 149 miles of range for 19000 where did you hear 100 miles of range for 30000
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,same problem as the now defunct honda e too expensive not enough range not enough room for america
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,at least that one looked really cool had honda quality and had a massive display with tons of features not the case here 😢
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,forrestsautoreviewsofficial was really sad to see it go even if we never got it in america it was the spiritual successor to the honda city turbo ii dead before honda could make another motocompo to put in the trunk the 500e looks good at least to me and i love the color options but everything else
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,34k makes sense because fiat quality 😂
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,impressive that they managed to cram so much msrp into such a featureless package
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,i owned a fiat 500 worst car i ever owned stuff would randomly break non stop things that would never break on much older american cars that i owned
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,webchamp930my best friend girlfriend owns a 500l she always says how much she hates that car its always at shop im telling her get a 24 trax and call it a day
2024-06-04,YouTube Comment,webchamp930 the worst fun car ive owned only got it up to around 60k miles before it totally stopped working ive never spent so much time and money fixing a car in my life
2024-06-04,YouTube Comment,officialcatdetector same here i owned till about 60k miles stuff would literally just fall off what a piece of junk it was known as fix it again tony i dont think that ever changed only good thing was i got a decent price on it when i traded it in from my tesla i will never ever get one again
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,34 grand for this is a joke who is the target audience its small slow no range and expensive as hell i am genuinly asking who would buy this if you have 34 grand for a base model you can just go with 40k and get something waaay better and electrical
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,rich quirky and single young people living in the city that need a car and have somewhere to charge it so basically 47 very insufferable people
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,tastethedifferencecheese why would i buy a jaaaaaaaaag i can just walk into the dealership ask for a test drive and take it home
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,gundam4president even those people would buy a corean eletric instead
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,i bought my tesla model y for 36k this car is a joke at best smh
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,i got a 2013 hyundai genesis coupe premium 2t no mods at the time 😛 with 37k miles for 12k and that thing is so fun to drive ive only bought used cars my girlfriend will only get brand new cars and paid like 30k for a brand new elentra bc she was convinced that used cars are bad but after she went with me to buy my genesis she changed her mind so im guessing they are marketing to the people that will only buy new cars no matter what
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,the secret is that there is no target audience its just a compliance car so stellantis can pretend its doing something to offset its horrendous fleet fuel economy figures until its actually decent evs arrive sometime next year
2024-06-04,YouTube Comment,devonsherwood not really a red flag she just wasnt educated on it ive been with her for 7 years and i just purchased my genesis so she saw how i did it and she changed her mind

2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,i wanna know who would spend 34k on this vehicle
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,rental car companies a fiat 500 only makes sense when it is cheaper to rent than take taxis or ride shares while on a low budget business trip
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,they are going to sit on the lot for several months and accumulate dust to the point where dealers are forced to lower the price
2024-06-03,YouTube Comment,xeqtrm1 fiats are likely made to last in europe in the us they break easily ive seen them on the road like toyota camrys here in the states when i visited italy back in 2008
