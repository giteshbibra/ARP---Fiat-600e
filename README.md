# 5 AUG MEETING

## Agenda:

1.⁠ ⁠Project plan *- approved*

2.⁠ ⁠⁠Topic modelling results 

3.⁠ ⁠⁠Potential customers of 500e, 600e and competitors 

4.⁠ ⁠⁠Questions

  (a) Whether ChatGPT for AI generated personas is acceptable *- approved*
   
    •⁠  ⁠If we use the chatgpt and not api, how should we add the process? 

  (b) Compilation of code into one file - *link to GitHub repository*
  
  (c) Report writing - *only on part you worked on, see email of Aug 5 by Philippe*
  
    •⁠  ⁠Writing only on what we worked on would seem very disjointed
