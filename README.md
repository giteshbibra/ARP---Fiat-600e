# ARP - Fiat 600e

Welcome to the **ARP - Fiat 600e** repository! This project is a collaborative effort by Jey-Lynn Liew, Medina Zelimger, Victoria Sanne, Jana Pawlenczuk, Tanisha Agrawal, and Gitesh Bibra. The focus of this repository is on the data collection, preprocessing, analysis, and AI persona simulation related to the Fiat 500 and 600e models. The primary objective is to gain insights into the expectations of Fiat 600e customers and evaluate the potential cannibalization risk for the Fiat 500e.

## Project Methodology and Repository Structure

This repository is organized according to the projectâ€™s methodology pipeline, with each folder representing a distinct step. To ensure a clear and systematic approach to achieving our goals, the process diverges into two distinct paths after data cleaning:

- **Path with Topic Modelling:** Handled by Jey-Lynn Liew, Medina Zelimger, and Gitesh Bibra.
- **Path with Clustering:** Developed by Victoria Sanne, Jana Pawlenczuk, and Tanisha Agrawal.

### Repository Structure

- **1. Data Collection:** Raw data and sources gathered for analysis.
- **2. Data Cleaning:** Scripts for cleaning and transforming the collected data to ensure it is ready for analysis.

**Path with Topic Modelling:**
- **3a. Topic Modelling and Sentiment Analysis:** Analysis of customer feedback using topic modeling to identify themes and sentiment analysis to gauge opinions.
- **4a. AI Personas:** Simulating customer personas and predicting preferences and behaviors based on sentiment and topic modeling results.

**Path with Clustering:**
- **3b. Clustering Analysis:** Grouping data based on similarities identified in the topic modeling phase, used to refine insights.
- **4b. AI Personas:** Simulating customer personas and predicting preferences and behaviors, incorporating insights from the clustering analysis.

### Steps 1 and 2: Model-Specific Codes and Data

The first two steps in our methodology include separate codes and datasets for the different car models (Fiat 500e, Fiat 600e, and competitors) and data sources (Youtube, Google News, Forums).
